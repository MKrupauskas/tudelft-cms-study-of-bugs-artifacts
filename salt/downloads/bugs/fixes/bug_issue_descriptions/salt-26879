It seems the releases for different Ubuntu versions are not up to date, and differ from one another:

[14.04 (trusty)](https://launchpad.net/~saltstack/+archive/ubuntu/salt?field.series_filter=trusty): 2015.5.3+ds-1trusty1
[14.10 (utopic)](https://launchpad.net/~saltstack/+archive/ubuntu/salt?field.series_filter=utopic): 2015.5.2+ds-1utopic1
[15.04 (vivid)](https://launchpad.net/~saltstack/+archive/ubuntu/salt?field.series_filter=vivid): 2015.5.0+ds-1utopic1

Looking at the [release notes page](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/), the latest 2015.5 branch release should be 2015.5.5, while the latest stable release should be 2015.8.0.

I'm using the official launchpad PPA, but only these versions are available for me (after running `apt-get update` of course): 

On 15.04 (latest stable Ubuntu):

``` sh
$ sudo apt-cache show salt-minion | grep Version                   
Version: 2015.5.0+ds-1utopic1
Version: 2014.7.0+ds-2
```

On 14.10:

``` sh
$ sudo apt-cache show salt-minion | grep Version 
Version: 2015.5.2+ds-1utopic1
Version: 2014.1.10+ds-1
```

I don't know about the release process, looking at previous issues I figure @joehealy does this manually or something. In any case, these releases should really be up to date and consistent, otherwise there is really no point in using the PPA. Which would be a shame.
