Salt Cloud is apparently not maintained in the old repo, and we're supposed to switch to the one in the "salt" repo. However, it's deb packaging has never been merged into any stable release since, leaving the question if it is considered production-ready.

If it's considered safe to use, fixing this issue should be as easy as cherry-picking 38d5a5cb85fe48df3ef55a4533aa2c2f481cd175 (currently in develop) into the 2014.1 branch.
