# ) Tested on 2015.2.0rc1

Request to have a more helpful and meaningful error message when file.patch fails as result of "patch executable required and not found on minion."
- Current Err-Msg: "file not found" 
- Proposed Err-Msg: "patch executable required and not found on minion", or better.

file.patch works fine, but the prerequisites must be in place in order or in to execute.
