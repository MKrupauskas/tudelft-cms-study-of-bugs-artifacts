### Description of Issue/Question
Currently, the authorized fs_type for NTFS is set in capital letter while mkfs uses small letters. Parted uses NTFS in capital letters. 
It is impossible to use the mkfs command to format in ntfs.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt 'minion' partition.mkfs /dev/sda1 NTFS
minion:
    Error: {0} is unavailable

salt 'minion' partition.mkfs /dev/sda1 ntfs
minion:
    ERROR: Invalid fs_type passed to partition.mkfs
