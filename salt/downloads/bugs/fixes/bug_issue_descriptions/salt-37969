### Description of Issue/Question

archive.extracted fails with the confusing error: "User root does not exist" if - user: root is specified.
The bug appears to have been introduced in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/3014afd51700e336b74bd4a73f2f1f1b36f95e0b , in archive.py .  if the uid is 0, the state reports that user doesn't exist.

Looking at the code, the same problem will happen if the group 'root' is specified.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
The failing state:

```
nextcloud_extract:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /var/www
    - source: https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-{{ pillar['nextcloud']['version'] }}.tar.bz2
    - source_hash: https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-{{ pillar['nextcloud']['version'] }}.tar.bz2.sha256
    # 755/644 therefore read only by default
    - user:   root
    - group:  www-data
    - if_missing: /var/www/nextcloud
    - archive_format: tar
    - require:
      - pkg: nextcloud_packages
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Create a archive.extracted state.   Specify "- user: root ".  state.apply. State run fails with "User root does not exist".  /etc/passwd is intact, su and sudo work, etc.

Boron does not appear to have this problem, it appeared after I updated salt-minion from a mirror of repo.saltstack.com/ .
