In my setup I'm using these configuration options on the minion:

``` yaml
startup_states: highstate
ext_job_cache: operations
```

The idea is that when a new machine spawns up and auto highstates, the result should be returned to a custom returner for someone to be able to manually check the result at a later time, or to issue alarms if a state failed.

But the custom returners are not synced on first run, only on the second run will it be available.

Is there a way to change this behaviour?
Other input on doing this kind of setup?
