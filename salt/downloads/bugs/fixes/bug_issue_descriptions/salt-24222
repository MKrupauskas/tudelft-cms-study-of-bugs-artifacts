I'm trying to get this Perl library installed on some machines, but for some reason it won't install through Salt.

```
libjson-pp-perl:
  pkg.installed:
    - refresh: False
```

I'm using the GitFS backend if it matters. Running salt-call from a server it should install on, I get this:

```

But then if I check to see if it's installed via apt, I get this:

```
:$ apt-cache policy libjson-pp-perl
libjson-pp-perl:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 2.27203-1
  Version table:
     2.27203-1 0
        500 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty/universe amd64 Packages
```

If I use package.latest, it installs fine. If I install it directly with salt-call, it installs fine too, just not with pkg.installed.

Master (Ubuntu 12.04):

```
:$ salt --version
salt 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
```

Minion (Ubuntu 14.04):

```
:$ salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
```

Looking at that, it looks like Salt thinks version "1" is installed, but it isn't. I have several other packages I installed with the same commit as this one and they all work fine. I've worked around it, but this looks like a bug to me.
