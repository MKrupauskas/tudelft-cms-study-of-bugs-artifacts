### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
salt versions tried: 2016.3.3, 2016.3.1, 2015.8.2 (Not sure if still applies to dev/recent salt version)
OS: Ubuntu 16.10 and CentOS (um, don't remember offhand)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
We have the following files:

```
/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/ec2.conf
/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/ec2.conf
```

These are pretty generic: they look very similar to [documentation examples](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/aws.html).

If you accidentally switch them so you providers file is in `cloud.profiles.d/` and your profiles file is in `cloud.providers.d/` (I grant you that this a pretty lame thing to do and means someone was not following the docs! I was actually helping someone who had copied these files from another project without knowing what they really meant...), then you get the following error message, which I would argue is kind of confusing:

```
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/config/__init__.py:2491: DeprecationWarning: The term 'provider' is being deprecated in favor of 'driver'. Support for 'provider' will be removed in Salt Nitrogen. Please convert your cloud provider configuration files to use 'driver'.

```

If it's simple, easy, or whatever: I would request making this error message more informative for people who make this lame mistake.  And, actually, I wouldn't want it to throw an Exception in this case, which is really what this is about.

At the very least, an issue like this somewhere googleable may help out others who get the same error message.

I might be able to take a crack at this if I can find the time.
