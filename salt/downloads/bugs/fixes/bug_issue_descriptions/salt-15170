host.present removes comments from hosts file. 

Before:

```
cat /etc/hosts
# Comment at the beginning of file
127.0.0.1   localhost        localhost.localdomain      localhost4            localhost4.localdomain4

# Some comment
5.6.7.8            salt-minion-debian-test

# End of file
```

Running the command (here module is used, but state does the same)

```
salt -v '*centos*' hosts.add_host 1.2.3.4 salt-minion-centos-test
```

After:

```
cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1      localhost       localhost.localdomain           localhost4            localhost4.localdomain4
5.6.7.8            salt-minion-debian-test
1.2.3.4         salt-minion-centos-test
```
