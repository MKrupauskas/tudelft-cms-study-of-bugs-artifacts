### Description of Issue/Question
On Window 2012 R2 box, the file.blockreplace throws the following error

```
line 2478, in blockreplace\n    perms['mode'])\n  File \"C:\\hidden\\hidden\\salt\\bin\\lib\\site-packages\\salt\\modules\\win_file.py\", line 1740, in check_perms\n    if 'applies_to' in grant_perms[user]:\nTypeError: string indices must be integers\n", 
```

The user is an administrator user with all admin privileges.

On probing this further, the check_perms in the file win_file module - At # Verify Grant Permissions,
**The grant_perms object was coming in as unicode instead of dictonary.**

The calling function file.py is sending a unicode object instead of dictonary
E.g. the input is coming as "Administrators". So the iterated object would be "A"
In the check_permsThe next line, checks to see if this user A exists and if exist, tries to get the "applies to" for the user.
Normally this fails and does not proceed as there is no user.
_But strangely on one box, we are getting a user 'd', even though there is no such user.
So it enter's the other loop, which tries to get the user in a dictionary.
As it is not a dictionary, it is throwing the above error._

One of the solutions we are trying in that "checking for (type(grant_perms) is dict)".  This resolves, but this is just a work around.  

Has anyone faced this issue
