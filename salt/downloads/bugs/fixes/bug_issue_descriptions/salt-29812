Packages with '-dev' in their name cannot be downloaded from repo.saltstack.com.
There are a number of issues open detailing this and it occurs with both Debian and Redhat packages. It is only occuring on the deploy and not the staging area, and there is nothing special about the rights of the packages, just the '-dev' in their name:

For example:
wget http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/6/x86_64/2015.8/libsodium-devel-0.4.5-3.el6.x86_64.rpm
wget -d -v --no-check-certificate https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/archive/2015.8.3/pool/main/libs/libsodium/libsodium-dev_1.0.3-1_amd64.deb

Associated files in that directory can be downloaded without issue:
wget https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/6/x86_64/archive/2015.8.3/libsodium-0.4.5-3.el6.x86_64.rpm
wget -d -v --no-check-certificate https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/archive/2015.8.3/pool/main/libs/libsodium/libsodium-dbg_1.0.3-1_amd64.deb
