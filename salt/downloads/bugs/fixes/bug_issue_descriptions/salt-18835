I have a minion running directly on the salt-master and it reliably triggers a race during bootstrap when the minion is restarting itself.  There's a watch on the minion.conf that triggers a reload.  After it reloads as part of the initial highstate, I see several of these per second on the master:

2014-12-09 14:10:10,799 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
2014-12-09 14:10:10,821 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
2014-12-09 14:10:10,843 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
2014-12-09 14:10:10,866 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
2014-12-09 14:10:10,888 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
2014-12-09 14:10:10,910 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message

There are some other bugs with similar messages but they seem to be doing a key deletion during the run.  This happens for me with auto accepted key and during a normal highstate run.

If I attach a debugger to the stuck process, I see that it's simply waiting for file data (i.e. salt://stuff/files/nsswitch.conf).

It seems to me that the session is not re-authenticating after the minion restart?

If I kill the job and restart the minion, things proceed correctly.
