This PR removed pchanges from a bunch of other stuff https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/49832/files

But when I checked at revision 12c5b33396 it looks like there are a few modules that have new `pchanges`:

```
salt/states/reg.py
388:           'pchanges': {},

salt/states/linux_acl.py
343:           'pchanges': {},
387:                   'pchanges': {},
431:                                'result': None, 'pchanges': changes})
455:                                    'result': None, 'pchanges': changes})
482:                            'result': None, 'pchanges': changes})
```

If I understand correctly, these should be removed, or they will cause issues for `test=True` mode.
