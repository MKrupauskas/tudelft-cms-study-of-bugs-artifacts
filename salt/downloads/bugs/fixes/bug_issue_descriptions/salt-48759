### Description of Issue/Question
When adding more aliases to a certificate the `certbot` command should be called with `--expand`.
(I haven't tested what happens after removing aliases but think that it could also be an issue)

### Setup
First run
```yaml
letsencrypt-domain.tld:
  acme.cert:
    - name: domain.tld
```

Second run
```yaml
letsencrypt-domain.tld:
  acme.cert:
    - name: domain.tld
    - aliases:
      - sub.domain.tld
      - another.domain
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create a certificate, then add aliases

Error
```
