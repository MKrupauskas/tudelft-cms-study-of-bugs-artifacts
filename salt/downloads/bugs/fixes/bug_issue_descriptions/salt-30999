According to the documentation, from 2015.8 git.latest tries to unset the upstream branch if the specified rev is a tag. This is achieved with the `--unset-upstream` switch of `git branch`, which is unavailable before git 1.9.2. The default git package of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS version is bellow this.

Workaround suggested by @babilen is to add a patched `_states/git.py` with `s/\['--unset-upstream']/None/'` applied.

Reproducing:

```
# salt precise state.low '{"state": "git", "fun": "latest", "name": "https://github.com/saltstack/pepper.git", "rev": "0.1.0", "target": "/tmp/a"}'
