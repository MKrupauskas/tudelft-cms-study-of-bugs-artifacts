While testing _cp.get_dir_ and _file.recurse_ I wanted to see the status of the job. I first tried

```
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid <jid>
```

but it seems like the command hung (that's why I first thought this is bug #3820). So I tried

```
salt-run jobs.print_job <jid>
```

which returned data within 40 seconds.

I retried _salt.runners.jobs.lookup_jid_ and now waited ~10 minutes. When I came back to my terminal, this command had also returned data, so the command did not hang.

But while comparing the output of the two commands I noticed, that there is no real difference between them. So the question is:

Why takes _salt.runners.jobs.lookup_jid_ ~7min30 and _salt.runners.jobs.print_job_ only 40 seconds?

After the first ~30 seconds of _salt.runners.jobs.lookup_jid_ I see thousands of

```
brk(0x2bee000)                          = 0x2bee000
brk(0x2c0f000)                          = 0x2c0f000
brk(0x2c30000)                          = 0x2c30000
brk(0x2c51000)                          = 0x2c51000
brk(0x2c72000)                          = 0x2c72000
```

lines I don't see when running _salt.runners.jobs.print_job_ (I was running salt-run with strace).

To reproduce:
1. Download a portage snapshot (~60MB):

```
wget http://distfiles.gentoo.org/snapshots/portage-latest.tar.bz2
```
1. Extract portage to /srv/salt (extracted 150.641 small files, total size on disk 808MB):

```
 tar xfj portage-latest.tar.bz2 -C /srv/salt/
```
1. Copy /srv/salt/portage to your minions:

```
salt '*' cp.get_dir salt://portage /tmp/test1
```
1. Press CTRL+C because the command will never return.
2. Watch the job

```
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20131104150150758257
```
1. Wait...

Pulling the portage tree via get_dir takes ~5 minutes on my environment.
"lookup_jid" will actual take 7.5 minutes (my setup has only one minion).
print_job will only take ~40 seconds.

Also, have you thought about adding a progress indicator to commands which may take some time?
