Windows minion throws exception when doing simple file.touch operations
Also happens on many other functions, e.g. file.remove, file.append, ..

file_exists was fixed earlier - but most functions in file. seems to be namedspaced. 

```
# salt WX0230  file.touch  c:/salt/conf/t
WX0230: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "salt/minion.py", line 721, in _thread_return
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__context__'
```
