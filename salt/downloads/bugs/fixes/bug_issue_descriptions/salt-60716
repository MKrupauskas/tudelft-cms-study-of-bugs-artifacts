**Description**
During investigation of issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60710, it was found that wildcard pillar targeting did not work using a salt-master v3003.1.

Note documentation gives very similar example at bottom of page: https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/targeting/pillar.html

Note: @garethgreenaway tested with current master branch and a proxy and found no issue.

**Setup**
salt-master on up to date Centos 7 running 3003.1

cat foo.sls
```
`foo:
  bar:
    version: 3003.1
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
root@Unknown:/srv/pillar# salt -I 'foo:bar:versi*' test.version
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
root@Unknown:/srv/pillar# salt -I 'foo:bar:version' test.version
tu20:
    3003.1
td10:
    3002.6
tc7:
    3003.1
tc7plus:
    3003.1
```

**Expected behavior**
Expect the glob wildcard to produce the same output as 
```
salt -I 'foo:bar:version' test.version
```
Also 
```
root@Unknown:/srv/pillar# salt -I 'foo:bar:version*' test.version
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
Expect it also to work.
