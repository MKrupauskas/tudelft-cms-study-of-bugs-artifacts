The `reload()` functions in `netbsdservice` & `rh_service` accept `**kwargs`, _but ignore them_.
[According to my research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtlcnvZE4HSKdDMzZGRxWEdVMzBkSVFvRWZwOWM4akE&usp=sharing) (and feel free to double-check me), no other service module accepts any additional args besides the required `name`, so accepting `**kwargs` isn't necessary for interface compliance.

Since they are ignored and aren't needed for API compatibility, do these `**kwargs` parameters need to go through a deprecation process, or can they be removed immediately?
