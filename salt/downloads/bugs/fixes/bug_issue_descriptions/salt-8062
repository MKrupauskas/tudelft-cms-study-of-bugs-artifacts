I'm running salt-ssh (develop branch HEAD as of today) via virtualenv, from a normal user. With a suitable roster, I can run test.ping:

```
$ salt-ssh -c . vagrant test.ping
vagrant:
    True
```

However, proceeding to a trivial state (single pkg.installed) I get:

```
$ salt-ssh -c . vagrant state.highstate
...
  File "/home/pfalcon/projects-3rdparty/salt/.venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/thin.py", line 79, in thin_sum
    thintar = gen_thin(cachedir)
  File "/home/pfalcon/projects-3rdparty/salt/.venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/thin.py", line 37, in gen_thin
    os.makedirs(thindir)
  File "/home/pfalcon/projects-3rdparty/salt/.venv/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 150, in makedirs
    makedirs(head, mode)
  File "/home/pfalcon/projects-3rdparty/salt/.venv/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 150, in makedirs
    makedirs(head, mode)
  File "/home/pfalcon/projects-3rdparty/salt/.venv/lib/python2.7/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache/salt'
```

At which point it hangs until Ctrl+C.

I can create that dir I guess, but what ownership/permission it should have? As we want any local user to be able to use salt-ssh, we don't speak about security and then instead of /var/cache/salt , /tmp should be used at all.
