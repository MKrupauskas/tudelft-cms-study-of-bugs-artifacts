**Description**

When trying to pass `--log-file` to salt-api the process still tries to 'verify' the default path to the log file.

**Setup**
N/A

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Pass --log-file to salt-api when the current user doesn't have access to /var/log/salt/api

**Expected behavior**

No exception from trying to verify /var/log/salt/api. The salt-api process should try to verify the location passed on the commandline.
