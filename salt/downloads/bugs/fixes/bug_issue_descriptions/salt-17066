I think it consumes too much RAM. Does it load the entire VM image onto RAM?

Since my RAM is only 4GB, salt-minion had to use 2GB of swap which was painfully slow and had to involve a lot of disk I/O.

Since it was very slow and consumed almost all of RAM and swap, salt-run threw an exception and quit with salt-minion running the job in the background.
