Using the latest Salt release, 2015.8, it seems that the highstate output is broken in some cases on the salt master.

Command: `sudo salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20151006191510666868 --out=highstate`
Error message: http://pastebin.com/skgBc83L

The output is working when not using `--out=highstate` argument, but return as data structure and not the traditional highstate output.
