This patch passes repr(filename), when it should just pass filename: 726eb220b2e60856fbf1522db943d8e7fb150e7c

This has totally broken archive extract (for me); I get this:

```
2015-01-29 16:46:43,881 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ] Command ['tar', 'xz', '-f', "'/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_usr_local_src_etcd-v0.4.6-linux-amd64.tar'"] failed with return code: 2
```

Note that the filename is double quoted.  This is incorrect when using argv style command invocation.
