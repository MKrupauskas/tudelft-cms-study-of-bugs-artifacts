A couple of points regarding arguments on the CLI.

Consider the following test function:

def clitest(arg1, arg2, arg3=None):
    return [arg1, arg2, arg3]

If we do:
$ sudo salt '*' test.clitest arg3=456 abc 123
we get:
{'host': ['abc', 123, '456']}

However if instead we do:
$ sudo salt '*' test.clitest arg3=456 arg2=abc 123
we get:
{'m1330': ['arg2=abc', 123, '456']}

So in other words key=val only works if the argument in the function already has a value.

A second point, if we do:
$ sudo salt '*' test.clitest

we get a nasty traceback and a TypeError. I've actually written a small patch which catches the TypeError and gives some more helpful output along the lines of "the following arguments are required: ..." Let me know if anyone is interested, I'm not really sure it is safe to catch a TypeError at this point?

Cheers,
Matt
