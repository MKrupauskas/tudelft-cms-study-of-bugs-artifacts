I'm trying to add a swap partition using salt states, so I wrote this:

```
swap:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: none
    - device: /mnt/swap
    - fstype: swap
    - opts:
      - sw
    - order: last
```

however, it causes this error:

```
    State: - mount
    Name:      none
    Function:  mounted
        Result:    False
        Comment:   mount: mount point none does not exist and updated the entry in the fstab
        Changes:   persist: update
```

which makes me feel like this:

```
:(
```
