Hello Folks,

I'm trying to set up AD/LDAP auth including group support.  I'm running 2015.5, and my configuration looks like the following:

``` yaml
external_auth:
  ldap:
    internal-team%:
      - '*':
        - .*
      - '@jobs'
      - '@runners'
      - '@wheel'

auth.ldap.filter: 'sAMAccountName={{ username }}'
auth.ldap.persontype: 'person'
auth.ldap.groupclass: 'group'
auth.ldap.groupou: 'Users'
```

We are using a bind account and that's set up as well as a base dn, and it's running TLS.

We're attempting to use pepper to access the salt-api, and when posting a job we're seeing the following in the master error log, despite the user's authentication working for the internal-team match in the master config:

```

```

It appears that it's looking for the key '*', so I've tested that as well, and it errors if I change my LDAP configuration to the following:

``` yaml

    '*':
      - '@runners'
      - '@jobs'
      - '@wheel'
    internal-team%:
      - '*':
        - .*
      - '@jobs'
      - '@runners'
      - '@wheel'
```

We get the following output, which I think might be misleading since I think it just auths as me first rather than the team, but I wanted to add it as well for any checks you guys might want to do:

```

I think the problem with the first auth is that it's authing against groups for publishing, but when running a runner it's not checking against groups?  Not sure, could use some help here.

Thanks guys!
