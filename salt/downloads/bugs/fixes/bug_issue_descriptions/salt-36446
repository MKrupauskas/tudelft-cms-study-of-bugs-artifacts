### Follow-up to the change in #36386.
### Setup
1. `salt-api -c /path/to/alt/etc/salt`
2. Alt config:
   
   ```
   # /path/to/alt/etc/salt/master
   root_dir: /path/to/alt/root
   user: notroot
   ```
3. Results in: `Failed to create path "/var/log/salt/api"` (the custom config isn't respected).
### Versions Report

Affects 2016.3 and merge-forwarded branches.

Works as expected after locally reverting #36386.
