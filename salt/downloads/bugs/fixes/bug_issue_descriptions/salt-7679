Example state to replicate;

```
/var/www/{{ domain }}:
  file.directory:
    - user: root
    - group: {{ domain }}
    - makedirs: True
    - recurse:
      - group
    - require:
      - group: {{ domain }}
```

Expected results;
- /var/www/domain.com/ owned by root:domain.com
- /var/www/domain/com/www owned by e.g. user:domain.com

Actual results;
- /var/www/domain.com/ owned by root:domain.com
- /var/www/domain/com/www owned by root:domain.com

>    State: - file
>    Name:      /var/www/example.com
>    Function:  directory
>        Result:    True
>        Comment:   Directory /var/www/example.com updated
>        Changes:   user: root

i.e. even if I don't specify user to be recursed, is still gets applied recursively and everything is owned by root:domain.com after every highState. This could in theory have something to do with me using groups with dots in their names.
