As of 0a62e6eced88111aeac8d32f9392d815369f3623, in commands and states, the final `/` of apt repo urls is discarded:
`salt '*' pkg.get_repo 'deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main'`
and
`salt '*' pkg.get_repo 'deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main'`

would give the same result.

The comments on:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/apt.py#L859

are in contradiction with the example provided on
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0.17/salt/states/pkgrepo.py#L111

So, pkgrepo defined like this would fail:

``` yaml
base:
      pkgrepo.managed:
        - name: deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main  # note the final /
        - dist: precise
        - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/logstash.list
```

The error in this case is:

```
Failed to confirm config of repo deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main: repo "deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main" was not found
```

We should fix the examples and add an explicit warning on the `name` argument stating that final slashes are strongly discouraged, or forbidden.

If we want to enforce the interdiction of the final slash, can we add an exception when parsing the state ?

Thanks !
