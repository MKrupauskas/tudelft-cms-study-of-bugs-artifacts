### Description of Issue/Question

I want to add a scheduled job so that all my minions run a highstate every night. When I set a fixed time for the job, everything works. However, when I add a splay time, the scheduled jobs aren't executed, and the minion logs contain only:
```
2017-11-17 14:56:00,089 [salt.minion      ][ERROR   ][18156] Exception unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int' occurred in scheduled job
```

I added logging output to `utils/schedule.py` which points to the error coming from [this line](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5d719a2219908285d20ede02635f03b8b0e35b16/salt/utils/schedule.py#L1267), which adds the randomised splay time. When it runs, `data['_next_fire_time']` is `None`, which obviously cannot be added to.

That `None`, in turn, is explicitly set [a few lines before](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5d719a2219908285d20ede02635f03b8b0e35b16/salt/utils/schedule.py#L1256), in code added by @vutny in 6f967acdd76fb7cee61f1cc1cb8ff3ab66ab2b13, which I do not know enough Salt internals to understand the rationale for.

### Setup
```yaml
nightly-highstate:
  schedule.present:
    - function: state.highstate
    - returner: pgjsonb
    - cron: '56 14 * * *'
    - splay: 10
```
