### Description of Issue

### `Â®` of death

Somewhere deep in Salt an output of `pkg.list_pkgs` is not decoded properly and passed as a binary string (not unicode)

This binary string gets stored in grain

When Salt tries to read the grain, it expects it to be stored as unicode, and fails miserably while trying to decode it, because the characters are from CP437

### Setup

1. Windows 10
2. Install the Intel driver (msi) https://downloadmirror.intel.com/28688/a08/WiFi_21.0.0_PROSet64.zip (link to the page: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28688/Intel-PROSet-Wireless-Software-and-Drivers-for-IT-Admins)  This also happens with MS Office localization package names that contain diacritics, but this Intel driver is the simplest way to reproduce the problem.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Apply the following state:

```
{% set pkgs = salt['pkg.list_pkgs']() %}

windows_packages:
   grains.present:
     - value : {{ pkgs }}
     - force: True
```

The output should look like this

```
local:
----------
          ID: windows_packages
    Function: grains.present
...
Intel\xc2\xae PROSet/Wireless WiFi Software:
                      21.0.0.2990

...

```

2. Apply the same state second time. It should fail like this:

```
