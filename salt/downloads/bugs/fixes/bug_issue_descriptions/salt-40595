### Description of Issue/Question

When I use `cmd.shell` in jinja in a pillar file, I get the DeprecationWarning telling me to use `cmd.shell` instead of `cmd.run`. Except I'm already doing that.

The other annoying thing about this is that because pillar is always rendered (at least in masterless mode), the DeprecationWarning appears on _every_ command, even when the pillar and the command are totally unrelated.

### Setup
pillar top.sls:
```
base:
  '*':
    - foo
```
pillar foo.sls
```
{%- set foo = salt.cmd.shell('echo foo') %}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run a salt execution module:
```
# salt-call --local grains.get os
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/utils/templates.py:80: DeprecationWarning: Starting in 2015.5, cmd.run uses python_shell=False by default, which doesn't support shellisms (pipes, env variables, etc). cmd.run is currently aliased to cmd.shell to prevent breakage. Please switch to cmd.shell or set python_shell=True to avoid breakage in the future, when this aliasing is removed.
