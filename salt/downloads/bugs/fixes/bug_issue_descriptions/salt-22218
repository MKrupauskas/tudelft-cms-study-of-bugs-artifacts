I tried including a formula using gitfs on a masterless setup, and ended up with this:

`Specified SLS mysql in saltenv base is not available on the salt master`

Seems related to #17963 but this is supposed to be fixed (I am using 2014.7.2). I would be happy to resolve that of course, but either way I wanted to point out that the error reads `... on the salt master` while I am running with `file_client: local` so there is no master per se.

As a salt beginner I have to say this makes me doubt if I completely messed up the setup or if it's just related to me using gitfs, and so on. Clarity in errors is critical at this stage.
