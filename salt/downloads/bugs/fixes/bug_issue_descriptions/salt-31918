### Description of Issue/Question

When using multiple environments of same top file, the ordering in top file is messed up. As the code are coming from git, the top file is pretty much the same across branches. I did not use gitfs because we have a differnt way to deploy the codes. 
### Setup

Having this issue on both --local and master setup.

config:

```
file_roots:
  base:
    - /tmp/salt-test/base/salt

  dev:
    - /tmp/salt-test/dev/salt

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /tmp/salt-test/base/pillar

  dev:
    - /tmp/salt-test/dev/pillar
```

top file on both base/dev env

```
dev:
  '*':
    - a
    - b
    - c
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `salt-call --local state.show_top` 

The expected output should be 3 states in a,b,c sequenc. But for some reason it end up like this:

```
local:
    ----------
    dev:
        - a
        - c
        - b
```

If I try to run state.highstate the sequence will be in a->c->b which is not what I expected.

Removing either one of the top file and the problem magically dissapears.

_Include debug logs if possible and relevant._
This is the test sample I run on local mode
