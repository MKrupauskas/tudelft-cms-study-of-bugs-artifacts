### Description of Issue/Question

The state.pkg.group_installed function is not using the supplied enablerepo option when running the underlying repoquery on the minion to list the packages that make up a group.

To clarify, for security we keep most yum repos in our master Pulp system disabled and use the "enablerepo" option in the state.pkg module to activate all the repos beginning with "ccs-" at package install time. This works fine for state.pkg.installed but not for state.pkg.group_installed which results in a traceback.

The following example shows how we are trying to stand up a new pulp server using packages in our master pulp repo.
### Setup

```
pulp.sls
-----------
pulp_core_packages_installed:
  pkg.group_installed:
    - name: pulp-server-qpid
    - enablerepo: ccs-*
```

```
yum.repos.d/ccs.repo
----------------------------
[ccs-pulp]
name = CCS Pulp for RHEL6
enabled = 0
sslverify = 1
gpgcheck = 0
sslcacert = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
baseurl = https://pulp.ourcompany.com/pulp/repos/repos/pulp/pulp/stable/latest/6/x86_64
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create a yum repo that is disabled by default
Create a state that calls state.pkg.group_installed for a package group in that repo
Run the state and you should observe a traceback such as:

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1594, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1491, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 1903, in group_installed
    diff = __salt__['pkg.group_diff'](name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/yumpkg.py", line 1643, in group_diff
    group_pkgs = group_info(name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/yumpkg.py", line 1597, in group_info
    raise CommandExecutionError('Group \'{0}\' not found'.format(name))
CommandExecutionError: Group 'pulp-server-qpid' not found
```
