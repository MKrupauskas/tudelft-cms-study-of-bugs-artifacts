OS: Ubuntu 14.04

The salt master process hangs when I try to start it with "service salt-master start" or "service salt-master stop".

Install method:

```
curl -o install_salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sudo sh install_salt.sh -M git v2014.7.0rc1
```

Versions output:

It does seem to work if I manually run `salt-master`, but if I run service salt start/stop, it hangs and the call to `service` never returns, nor does a python process start to host the salt-master. It never creates its logfile at /var/log/salt/master, even if I set the logging level in the YAML to "trace", nor is anything written to /var/log/upstart/salt-master.log to indicate that there is a problem.
