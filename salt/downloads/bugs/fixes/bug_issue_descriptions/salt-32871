### Description of Issue/Question:

I am pointing my salt master to my svn repo using 'svnfs_remotes' [https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#svn-subversion-remote-file-server-backend](url)

So, there are two issues here, but they might be related, so I'm documenting them both. 
1. /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/fileserver/svnfs.py is overwriting  remote_map.txt at start up
2. salt master is not maping local svnfs cache to salt fileserver _(`salt '*' cp.list_master` returns no files & state.highstate reports that no top file exists, but it does in the repo)_
### Setup

I have a single VM running master & minion 

**(master config)**

```
interface: 0.0.0.0
hash_type: sha256
fileserver_backend:
  - svn
svnfs_remotes:
  - svn://<repo_url>/saas/branches/internal/inc4/SASSY-743:
    - root: /trunk/salt/roots/salt/
```

**(minion config)**

```
hash_type: sha256
master: localhost
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Master starts, caches a copy of the repo just fine, but then throws the following error:

```

```

`/var/cache/salt/master/svnfs/remote_map.tx` is not populated with anything. 

@babilen from webchat suggested 

> Stop the master, edit /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/fileserver/svnfs.py and comment "repos.append(rp_)" in there by prefixing it with # so it looks like "# repos.append(rp_)" -- This should be on line 193 (or somesuch) between "CLIENT.checkout(....)" and "new_remote = True"

after doing this, and `rm -rf /var/cache/salt/master/svnfs/*` and restarting master `/var/cache/salt/master/svnfs/remote_map.txt` is populated with `<svn cache DIR name> = <repo_url>`.  No errors are returned in debug log. 

However, when `salt '*' cp.list_master` is issued, nothing is returned.  I'm expecting a listing of all the files from the configured svnfs_remotes svn repo. 

```
[root@hostname ~]# salt '*' cp.list_master
