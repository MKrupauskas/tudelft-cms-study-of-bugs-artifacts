### Description of Issue/Question
Create_service function in win_service module raises exception when service exists.
This seems a bit exaggerated.
In other modules, when the the required status already present it returns "true" and does nothing.
Worst case it would return false if exists, but never encountered exception in similar situation.

relevant code from module:
    # Test if the service already exists
    if name in get_all():
        raise CommandExecutionError('Service Already Exists: {0}'.format(name))

### Setup
salt '*' service.create <service name> <path to exe> display_name='<display name>'

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run create service with service name that already exists.
