my env Ubuntu 14.04, amd64, with salt-master-2014.7.0 or 2014.1.11

i set autosign.conf as

<pre>
test
*.datayes.com
</pre>

i expect it'll accept `test`, `server.datayes.com`, and reject `server`.

it works correctly in salt-master.2014.1.11
but failed in salt-master.2014.7.0, it'll not accept any key
