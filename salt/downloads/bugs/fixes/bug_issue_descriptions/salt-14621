Hello,
Can you help me?
I have problem with roster and salt-ssh.

rsoter content:
'192.168.110.1':
  host: 192.168.110.1
  user: root
  passwd: '123456'

when execute command  salt-ssh '192.168.110.1' -r '/etc/init.d/salt-minion restart'
the result:
retcode:
        255
    stderr:
        Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password).

but when I change the roster like this
'192.168.110':
  host: 192.168.110.1
  user: root
  passwd: '123456'

then result:
 retcode:
        0
    stderr:

```
stdout:
    Stopping salt-minion daemon: [  OK  ]
    Starting salt-minion daemon: [  OK  ]
```

I mean that  the id is different with host ip, the command will be successful.
But when the id is same with host ip, the command will be fail.
Is it a bug?
Why!
