### Description of Issue/Question

Using `salt-run pillar.show_pillar` for the master minion (whose id is suffixed with `_master`) results in the following error due to missing grain data:

```
Exception occurred in runner pillar.show_pillar: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/vagrant/salt-src/salt/client/mixins.py", line 390, in _low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/vagrant/salt-src/salt/runners/pillar.py", line 88, in show_pillar
    id_, grains, _ = salt.utils.minions.get_minion_data(minion, __opts__)
  File "/vagrant/salt-src/salt/utils/minions.py", line 85, in get_minion_data
    grains = data['grains']
KeyError: 'grains'
```

A result of this issue is that there is currently no way to check what the master minion's pillar contents are.

A hack to make this work again is to change lines 86-87 of `salt/utils/minions.py` like so

```
grains = data['grains'] if 'grains' in data else {}
pillar = data['pillar'] if 'pillar' in data else {}
```

### Setup
All you need a salt master running `2016.11.4`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
# saltmaster's host name is "master"
root@master:/home/vagrant# salt-run pillar.show_pillar master_master
[WARNING ] Unable to find IPv6 record for "localhost" causing a 10 second timeout when rendering grains. Set the dns or /etc/hosts for IPv6 to clear this.

    grains = data['grains']
