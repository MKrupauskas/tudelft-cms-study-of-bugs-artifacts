With "ebuild.update" could happened for use flags to change without find_changes detecting it.
find_changes only looks to dicts given by list_pkgs, which only contain version info.

To solve this problem I could let ebuild.list_pkgs add to the "version" some "extra info" (i.e. use flags), but doing this for every package installed would be a _HUGE_ work which would take _a lot_ of time.

What should i do? Should I parse emerge output?
