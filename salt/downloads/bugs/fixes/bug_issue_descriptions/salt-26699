Hi

I have recently updated our master to the following version:

``` console
root@mgmt1:/srv/saltstack# salt --versions
Salt Version:
           Salt: 2015.8.0-316-g226ef73

Dependency Versions:
         Jinja2: 2.7.3
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
           Mako: Not Installed
         PyYAML: 3.11
          PyZMQ: 14.0.1
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13)
           RAET: Not Installed
        Tornado: 4.2.1
            ZMQ: 4.0.4
       dateutil: Not Installed
          ioflo: Not Installed
        libnacl: Not Installed
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
 msgpack-python: 0.4.6
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
        timelib: Not Installed

System Versions:
           dist: Ubuntu 14.04 trusty
        machine: x86_64
        release: 3.13.0-24-generic
         system: Ubuntu 14.04 trusty
```

Since doing this `salt-cloud` no longer installs the minion, the process completes without error but no minion is installed.
