After upgrading masters and minions to 2019.02, observed this behavior:

- daily scheduled highstate fails to run UNLESS a manual pillar has been run recently (last 12 hours or so), but this doesn't always make it run
- when the highstate runs, if there are any failures, I receive 20 or so reports of failure per minion via the returner, as opposed to just one with 2018.03.4; it appears that the minion is trying state.apply over and over again for about two hours, after which it stops

This happens on two different masters.

Here's is a pillar/schedule.sls for one of the masters:

```
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    when: 4:30am
    splay: 600
    maxrunning: 1
    returner: highstate
```

Downgrading salt and salt-minion on the minions fixed the problem.

Here is one of the upgraded minions:
