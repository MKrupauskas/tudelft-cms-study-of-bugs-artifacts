on  intermediary masters, seeing discrepancy between the number of ret events in the master log and syndic log. 

```
grep 20150318000231673705 /var/log/salt/master |awk '/Got return/  {print $9}' |   wc -l 
grep -c 20150318000231673705 /var/log/salt/syndic
```

shows different number of events each time. Obviously this is causing number of ret events in  master of master to be wrong from the actual. 

not sure if this is a case in 2014.7.2 as well...
