You cannot target subsets of minions when using pillar data as the targeting mechanism for external_auth.

Let's say you have the config:

```
external_auth:
  pam:
    sjmh:
      - 'I@role:webserver':
        - test.ping
```

And you have minions, web1, web2 and web3, all of which have 'role: webserver' in their pillar.

The only way you can run the test.ping command is to execute `salt -I role:webserver test.ping`.  You cannot execute, for instance, `salt web1 test.ping`, even though it has the role.

This also applies for CIDR matches ( #21679 ).  The only place this seems to work is with lists and grain data, and grain data only works if you have the minion_data_cache on.

It'd be nice to see this with pillar data, as targeting permissions off of grains is rather insecure, but the only way to provide flexible targeting ( other than making up giant lists of minion ids )
