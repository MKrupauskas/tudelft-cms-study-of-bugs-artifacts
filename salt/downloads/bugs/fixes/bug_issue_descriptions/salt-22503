Hello all.

I experienced the following bug : 
1. Runned `sudo salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar` on the master
2. Every minion responded `True`
3. Runned `sudo salt-run manage.status`
4. All my minions are now down (except the minion running on the same host as the master)

The logs files located at `minions://var/log/salt/minion` contains no evidence of an unexpected behaviour nor exception.
All hosts are running Ubuntu 14.04 or 12.04. Also, on minions, it looks like the `salt-minion` service is still running :

```
$ sudo service salt-minion status
salt-minion start/running, process 7452
```

So now, I have a total of 0 remote minions responding to their master calls, and I have the pain to ssh on each of them to restart the `salt-minion` service.

I think, but cannot proove it, that this issue may be related to issuer #13558 as I experience the same symptoms. I experienced this bug once at the moment, but I will provides extra informations if it append again.

Please, let me know if you need more informations to inspect this behaviour
