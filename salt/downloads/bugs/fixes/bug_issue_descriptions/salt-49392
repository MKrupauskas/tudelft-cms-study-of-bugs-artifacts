### Description of Issue/Question
When using host.present, if changing the IP address, a second entry is created and the old one is not removed.
In /etc/hosts only the first entry is taken into account, so the change is not taken into account.

### Setup
```
backend:
  host.present:
    - ip: {{ backend_ip }}
```
