I am trying to boostrap a few hundred vms via salt-cloud's saltify provider. I have a password similar to q4BKSNi>(<2q. 
When I put this in my cloud profile like so

```
sudo_password: q4BKSNi>(<2q
```

According to debug, the initial login via ssh works using this password but when elevating for any tasks using sudo the password does not work. I have tried removing all special characters from the password and it still fails to bootstrap (or create any folders or anything).

If i set `sudo: False` and comment remove the `sudo_password`, the bootstrap makes it much further including creating a few folders before failing because it needs permissions.
