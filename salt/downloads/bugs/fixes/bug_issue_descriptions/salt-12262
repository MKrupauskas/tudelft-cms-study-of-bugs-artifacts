I have the following salt architecture set up:

```
         A 
         |
         B
        / \
       C   D
      / \
     E   F
```

salt-master is running on A, B, C, D, E, F
salt-minion is running on B, C, D, E, F
salt-syndic is running on B, C, D, E, F

A is syndic-master for B
B is syndic-master for C, D
C is syndic-master for E,F

B is minion of A
C, D are minions of B
E, F are minions of C

When i do a `salt '*' test.ping` from B, i get a response from C, D, E & F

```
[root@B ~]# salt '*' test.ping
C:
    True
D:
    True
E:
    True
F:
    True
```

When i do `salt '*' test.ping` from A, i only get a response from B, C & D and no response from E & F. 

```
[root@A ~]# salt '*' test.ping
B:
    True
C:
    True
D:
    True
```
###### Note:

If i directly target the minion explicitly from A, I get a response. 
For example:

```
[root@A ~]# salt 'E' test.ping
E:
    True
```

```
[root@A ~]# salt 'F' test.ping
F:
    True
```

However if i target both minions explicitly from A, i get no response.

```
[root@A ~]# salt 'E, F' test.ping
[root@A ~]
```

All keys have been accepted by the respective masters. 
All servers are using Salt: 2014.1.0

Why am i not getting a response from E & F when i ping them from A?
