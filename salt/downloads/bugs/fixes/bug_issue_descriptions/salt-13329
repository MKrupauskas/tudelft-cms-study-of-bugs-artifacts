This looks to be an issue with any provider that has `list_nodes_min()`. When running any generic query (`-Q`, `-F` or `-S`), the default function called is `list_nodes_min()`. This doesn't happen when calling `-f list_nodes*()` directly.

Hopefully an easy fix, looking directly at command line args to see if a generic query was called, and if so, run the appropriate function.
