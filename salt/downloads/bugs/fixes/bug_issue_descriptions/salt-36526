### Description of Issue/Question

If I try to use a `file.managed` state with a `source` from S3 and the S3 call fails to authenticate, I get the following error message:

``` yaml
----------
          ID: /my-file
    Function: file.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: File sum set for file /my-file of f28dea6700763708e2aecb689ed22c0ad3f06e5d does not match real sum of b5d44cde7aa14c6b6ef793f19212a80d167c09ff
     Started: 14:16:02.270682
    Duration: 3252.121 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              diff:
                  New file
```

It's really misleading as it hides the underlying error and makes it difficult to track what the actual problem is.
### Setup

State:

``` yaml
/my-file:
  file.managed:
    - mode: 755
    - user: root
    - source: s3://my-bucket/my-file
    - source_hash: sha1=f28dea6700763708e2aecb689ed22c0ad3f06e5d
```

See below for different pillar configuration.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Depending on the configuration, the actual error can be different.

With an authentication problem (mistake or bad credentials):

``` yaml
s3:
  # authentication problem
  keyid: "wrong key id"
  key: "wrong secret key"
  location: eu-central-1
```

I get the following error:

```
[DEBUG   ] S3 Request: https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/my-file?
[DEBUG   ] S3 Headers::
[DEBUG   ]     Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/20160923/eu-central-1/s3/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date, Signature=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

[ERROR   ] File changed:

[INFO    ] Completed state [/my-file] at time 14:22:30.656761
```

If the location is not correctly set (I'm using `eu-central-1` but it defaults to `us-east-1`):

``` yaml
s3:
  keyid: "good key id"
  key: "good secret key"
  # missing location
```

I get this error instead (note that I'm running this code not on a EC2 machine, hence the timeout error):
