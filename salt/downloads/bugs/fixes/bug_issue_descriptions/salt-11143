If you have a user with an invalid shell - one that is not present in the output of `chsh -l` or something like `nologin` - any shelling out the salt-minion will do on behalf of the user calling `salt-call` will return an error code of 1 but no information on to why that is.

This ended up being pretty hard to debug because one user would work, but another user would not. In my mind, since the minion is a daemon, any user calling it should expect exactly the same results if the command and arguments are the same. At the least I think we should potentially check if shell is set to an inactive or invalid shell and log a warning.
