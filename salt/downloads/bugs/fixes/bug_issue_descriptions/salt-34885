### Description of Issue/Question

Get incorrectly matched not connected minions on variable grains target
### Setup

```
salt --version
salt 2015.5.10 (Lithium)
```

2015.8.10 and 2016.3.1 also affected.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1) Salt Master(2015.5.10/2015.8.10/2016.3.1)
2) Accepted but disconnected(turned off) minion for some time, so cache is invalidated by timeout, so /var/cache/salt/master/minions/<minion_id>/data.p is absent
OR
2.1) Accepted but disconnected(turned off) minion and run command:

```
salt-run cache.clear_pillar tgt=<minion_id>
```

3) Then

```
# salt -G 'foo:bar' test.ping
some_minion:
    Minion did not return. [Not connected]
```

```
salt -G 'foo' test.ping
some_minion:
    Minion did not return. [Not connected]
```

### Comments:

As I can see at:
[https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/minion.py#L2339](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/minion.py#L2339)
At least we should get error

```
        if delimiter not in tgt:
            log.error('Got insufficient arguments for grains match '
                      'statement from master')
```

on 'foo' target, but we do not get this error.
foo, and bar could have any value.
