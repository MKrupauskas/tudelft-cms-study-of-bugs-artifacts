On current version of salt/salt/output/highstate.py there is an error detection code on line 57->63

<pre>
            for tname, info in data[host].items():
                if not '__run_num__' in info:
                    err = ('The State execution failed to record the order '
                           'in which all states were executed. The state '
                           'return missing data is:')
                    hstrs.insert(0, pprint.pformat(info))
                    hstrs.insert(0, err)
</pre>

But just after this code the next lines are :

<pre>
    for tname in sorted(
                    data[host],
                    key=lambda k: data[host][k].get('__run_num__', 0)):
</pre>


So if `__num_num__` is not in info the next step is to run a lambda accessing the `__num_num__` key. Generating a **"AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'"** Traceback. Seems like the error detection code should return or make something.

I have added a:

<pre>
   del data[host][tname]
</pre>

At the end of the error detection code, so at least may commands can end gracefully, but that's quite certainly not the right thing to do (no failure counter, and it breaks valid results also).
