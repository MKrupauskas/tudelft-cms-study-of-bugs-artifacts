During deploying a single VM with the `cloudstack` driver with `salt-cloud` CLI, it borks out:

```
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: 'timeout'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 276, in run
    self.config.get('names')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1405, in run_profile
    ret[name] = self.create(vm_)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1273, in create
    self.opts['sync_after_install']
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 542, in cmd

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 297, in run_job
    raise SaltClientError(general_exception)
SaltClientError: 'timeout'
```

(and yes, considering #27953 and #27956, this is turning out to be a quite bumpy ride :P)
