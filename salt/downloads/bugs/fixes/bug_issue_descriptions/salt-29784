Take the following state declaration and save it as event.sls:

```
Blocks with salt-call --local state.apply event:
  event.send:
    - data:
      status: 'Hello Event!'
```

A  `salt-call --local state.apply event` would never finish:

```
# salt-call --local state.apply event
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** done ** u'event.sls'
[INFO    ] Running state [Blocks with salt-call --local state.apply event] at time 11:49:15.667312
[INFO    ] Executing state event.send for Blocks with salt-call --local state.apply event
^C
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
```

This is probably not the desired behaviour.
