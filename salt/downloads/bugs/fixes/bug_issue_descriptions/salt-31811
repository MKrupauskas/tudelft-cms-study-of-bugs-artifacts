### Description of Issue/Question

Hi,
I found a problem with Salt on Armhf (on Scaleway instances),
When bootstraping Salt, I got this on output (block at `apt-get update` after repo adding) :

```
 W: Failed to fetch http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/latest/dists/jessie/InRelease 

Unable to find expected entry '**main/binary-armhf**/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)
  E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```

I have trying on Ubuntu and Debian, with Salt-Cloud or directly by SSH (by adding salt's repo).

I have trying with "-P" flag and with "git version" flag too.

Here the full error from `salt-cloud -l debug`:

```
`* ERROR: Failed to run install_debian_8_deps()!!!`
`Error: There was a profile error: Command 'ssh -t -t -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -oControlPath=none -oPasswordAuthentication=no -oChallengeResponseAuthentication=no -oPubkeyAuthentication=yes -oKbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa -p 22 root@163.x.x.x.x \'/tmp/.saltcloud-**/deploy.sh -c \'"\'"\'/tmp/.saltcloud-**\'"\'"\'\'' failed. Exit code: 1`
```
### Setup

The connexion to Scaleway work fine (salt-cloud -F scaleway)
