**Description**
If uptime on AIX minion is less than 24 hours call to `status.uptime` will generate `IndexError`.

**Setup**
AIX 7.2 minion with `uptime` less than 24 hours.

- [x] on-prem machine
- [ ] VM (Virtualbox, KVM, etc. please specify)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD

  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Issue `salt AIX_MINION status.uptime` from salt master.

**Expected behavior**
Information regarding uptime appears on stdout.

**Actual behaviour**
No information is returned, instead an error appears:
``` 
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/opt/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1606, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/opt/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/opt/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/status.py", line 243, in uptime
        seconds = _get_boot_time_aix()
      File "/opt/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/status.py", line 92, in _get_boot_time_aix
        hms = days[1].split(':')
    IndexError: list index out of range
``` 

**Versions Report**
Salt master running at version 3002.6, minion running at version 2018.3.2.

**Additional context**
If uptime of AIX system is less than 24 hours the output of `ps -o etime= -p 1` is as follows:
``` 
$ ps -o etime= -p 1
   11:10:06
``` 
This is how the output looks on a host with 96+ days of uptime (for comparison):
``` 
$ ps -o etime= -p 1
96-20:58:27
```
