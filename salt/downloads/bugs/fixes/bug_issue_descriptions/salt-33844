### Description of Issue

On Linux systems, `salt minion shadow.set_expire user -1` can be used to unexpire an account.  There is no proper way to unexpire an expired account via a `user.present` state.

Using `-1` for the value of `expire` would work if `user.present` weren't explicitly ignoring it for some mysterious reason:

```
        if expire and expire is not -1 and lshad['expire'] != expire:
            change['expire'] = expire
```

Notice the `and expire is not -1` in the code above (which was taken from [`salt/states/user.py` line 145](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2016.3.0/salt/states/user.py#L145)).

As a workaround, you can use `"-1"` for the value of `expire` (use double quotes to force it to be a string so that it doesn't compare equal to the integer -1).  This will cause the account to become unexpired as desired, but `user.present` will generate a benign error:

```
These values could not be changed: {'expire': '-1'}
```
### Setup

File `users.sls`:

```
foo:
  user.present:
    - password: '$6$o1LtwaH.ofLR8eat$p8qISh4/KfEGb5/iK2VoTkaVLMP16YzjjMyYbxo5z.gjRrPenHjgREM3oweSybnl7PR7Tc6LvUI.ySosI2yKn.'
    - fullname: Firstname Lastname
    - shell: /bin/bash
    - expire: -1
    - home: /home/foo
    - uid: 1234
    - gid: 1234
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. copy the above `users.sls` state file to the `file_roots` directory
2. run `salt minion state.apply users` to create the `foo` user
3. run `salt minion shadow.info foo` and verify that `expire` is `-1`
4. run `salt minion shadow.set_expire foo 1` to disable the `foo` account
5. run `salt minion shadow.info foo` and verify that `expire` is `1`
6. run `salt minion state.apply users` to try to unexpire the `foo` account
7. run `salt minion shadow.info foo` and note that `expire` is still `1`, not `-1`
