### Description of Issue
Hello

E.g. we have salt formula like this:

```
my_formula:
  file.prepend:
    - name: ~/output.txt
    - makedirs: True
    - text: |
        lorem ipsum blablabla
```

When I call " state.highstate test=True" I always get "Result: False":

```
ID: my_formula
Function: file.prepend
Name: ~/output.txt
Result: False
Comment: /root/output.txt: file not found
Started: 14:14:12.353606
Duration: 1.17 ms

```

But when I call only "  state.highstate  " I get:
```
ID: my_formula
Function: file.prepend
Name: ~/output.txt
Result: True
Comment: Prepended 1 lines
