**Description**
Service does not restart if there is a change in the config file. 

**Setup**
```
install_influxdb:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - influxdb

enable-influxd:
  service.enabled:
    - name: influxd

start-influxd:
  service.running:
    - name: influxd
    - full_restart: None
    - watch:
      - file: install_influx_config

install_influx_config:
  file.managed:
    - name: /usr/local/etc/influxd.conf
    - source: salt://influxdb/files/influxd.conf
    - user: root
    - group: wheel
    - mode: 0644
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
I copied the example from https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/requisites.html 
and made just made slight modifications ( changed the application name )  . 

First run . Deploy application . Runs fine . 
Someone logs into the server modifies the config . 
Run state.apply again. Minion does not return anything. It idles forever.

I found out that the minion is trying to execute service.full_restart , but it seems this is not implemented.

Minion Log:
```
'service.full_restart' is not available.
```
Nevertheless , if the func is not available it should fail , but even waiting for 5 - 10 minutes the job idles forever ? 


**Expected behavior**
If the /usr/local/etc/influxd.conf is not in the correct state . Change should be applied and the service should be reloaded or restarted , both does not work .
