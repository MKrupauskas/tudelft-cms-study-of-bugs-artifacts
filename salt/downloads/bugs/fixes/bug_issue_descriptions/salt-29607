```
salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar 
```

(have about ~1000 conencted to this master)
Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. If this error persists after verifying the master is up, worker_threads may need to be increased.

Oddly this doesnt show in the master log but only in the cli.
