Hi,

I have this in /etc/fstab
`/tmp /var/tmp none rw,nodev,nosuid,bind 0 0`

When I try to umount it and remove from fstab all is working fine on the first run, but on the second run I have an error, `umount: /var/tmp: not mounted. fstab entry for device /var/tmp not found`

```
umount /var/tmp bindfs:
  mount.unmounted:
    - name: /tmp
    - device: /var/tmp
    - persist: true
```

I'm unable to find how can I avoid this error, it doesn't seem to have a force option or something like that

Best regards,
