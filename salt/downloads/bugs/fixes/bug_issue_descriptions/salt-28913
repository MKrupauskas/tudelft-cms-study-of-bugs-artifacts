When trying to use file.managed with a file hosted on S3 and using IAM, the file download fails when the S3 bucket is in a different region than the EC2 instance.

Running salt-call with loglevel "all" shows that the authentication call contains the region of the instance instead of the region where the bucket is hosted. Patching the method in salt/fileclient.py (line 572) and hardcoding the right region fixes the problem, but it's obviously not a proper solution.

This used to work correctly in 2015.5, and it's broken in 2015.8.
