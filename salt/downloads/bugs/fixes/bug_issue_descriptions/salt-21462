On a test server I've got, we did an upgrade from Lucid (10.04) to Precise (12.04). The salt minion stopped working, and I saw:

```
geoffc@mxtest: ~ $ apt-cache policy python-zmq
python-zmq:
  Installed: 13.0.0-3lucid
  Candidate: 13.0.0-3lucid
  Version table:
 *** 13.0.0-3lucid 0
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     13.0.0-2precise 0
        500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/saltstack/salt/ubuntu/ precise/main amd64 Packages
     2.1.11-1 0
        500 http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/ubuntu/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages
```

As the lucid ppa has a package with a higher version number than precise, the python-zmq library doesn't get upgraded. The salt-minion then fails to start.
