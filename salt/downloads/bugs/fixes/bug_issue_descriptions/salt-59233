**Description**
After updating our minions from 2019.x to 3002.2 they stopped running the via pillar scheduled highstate. I found out that this was caused by usage of grains[] within the pillar top.sls file.

Systems with an older OS which run an older salt-minion version (3000.5 on RHEL6 and 2016.11.3 on RHEL5) still work fine.

**Setup**
Part of our pillar top.sls file:
```
base:
  '*':
    - highstate
    - firewall.{{ grains['host'] }}
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Restart the salt-minion process
```
# salt-call schedule.list
local:
    ----------
    schedule:
        ----------


# salt-call pillar.items
local:
    ----------
    firewall:
        ----------
        log:
            True
        services:
            - ssh
    schedule:
        ----------
        highstate:
            ----------
            enabled:
                True
            function:
                state.highstate
            minutes:
                60
            name:
                highstate

# salt-call saltutil.refresh_pillar
local:
    True

# salt-call schedule.list
local:
    schedule:
      highstate:
        enabled: true
        function: state.highstate
        minutes: 60
        name: highstate
```
However after restarting the salt-minion process (or the entire minion system for that matter) schedule.list is empty again.

**Expected behavior**
It should run like before

**Additional context**
I was able to get things working again by changing `grains['host']` to `salt['grains.get']('host')`
It seems to me that the other format should work as well though, especially since it works fine on older minions, or after a pillar_refresh was run
