Hi,

I'm having troubles running some states at SLES11 SP4.

when I run a highstate the following errors come out:

``` python-traceback
"[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

```

if I run same states one by one some of them end correctly and some other say:

```
"          ID: nscd
    Function: service.running
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1591, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/service.py", line 296, in running
                  before_toggle_enable_status = __salt__['service.enabled'](name)
                File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/utils/lazy.py", line 93, in __getitem__
                  raise KeyError(key)
              KeyError: 'service.enabled'
     Started: 10:23:15.316262
    Duration: 31.489 ms
     Changes:"
```

even though no service.enabled is at those states or "enable: true" at service.running. that state looks like this:

``` salt
"nscd:
  pkg:
    - installed
  service:
    - running
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/ldap.conf"
```

master runs 2015.8.1 on RHEL 6.7 and these minions on SLES11 SP4 running same version.
some other minions on RHEL 6 & 7 do not fail.

thanks in advance.
