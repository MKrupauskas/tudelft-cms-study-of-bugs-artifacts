### Description of Issue
I have some states with 'unless' that are running **regardless** of the unless condition exit code.

### Setup
After lot of lost time, I deduced that the problem is that in some conditions, when a salt python exception is thrown, the onlyif/unless conditions are not evaluated anymore in **next** state entries.

I succeeded in reproducing with a smaller state:
```
zsh_fail_1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo hey
    - runas: cristi
    - unless: test -d ~/.zinit/bin    

zsh_test_1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo "t1"
    - onlyif: /bin/false
```
When I used some 'test.fail_without_changes' state for 'zsh_fail_1', 'zsh_test_1' is working ok.
But if you try using it as above, the zsh_test_1 command is executed!

The important part here is that user 'cristi' does not exist, so code gets some python exception like below:
```

          ID: zsh_fail_1
    Function: cmd.run
        Name: echo hey
      Result: False

Strange value for the 'System Versions' 'release' field. Looks more like the kernel's name  - I'm running salt inside an ubuntu LXD container on a Manjaro distro.
