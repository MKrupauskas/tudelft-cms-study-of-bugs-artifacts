cc @0xf10e as he expressed interest

I have some minions on crappy consumer connections, and master's
manage.status keeps showing them as down. I can restart service, and
it helps for a while, but then it stops working again. I was told to try using status.master to check for that, but it returns same stuff no matter what the master thinks about the status of the minion:

```
$ sudo salt-call status.master ; echo $?
local:
    None
0
```

Master is archlinux, minions in question are OpenBSD, all run 2015.5.2
