### Description of Issue/Question
file.managed doesn't report changes even if there are changes when using local:// as source.  It does do the correct thing on the filesystem, but it reports no changes, even if there are changes.  The source is on nfs if that makes a difference.

### Setup

/users/network/animation/tractorbashUbuntu.sh is on a mounted nfs share.
/opt/pixar/custom/ already exists as a directory

Salt State:
```
move_tractorbashUbuntu.sh:
  file.managed:
    - name: /opt/pixar/custom/tractorbashUbuntu.sh
    - source: file:///users/network/animation/tractorbashUbuntu.sh
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Make A change to the local destination file, or delete it.
Run state.apply <state above>
The destination file is changed appropriately, but salt reports that there were no changes

#### Output
```
