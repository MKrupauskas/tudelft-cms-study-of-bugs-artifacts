This is due to the fact that RPMs and DEBs have a metadata check done in `salt.modules.pkg_resource._parse_pkg_meta()`, which doesn't return the arch. Therefore, packages submitted in the format `pkgname.arch` in CentOS fail the metadata check, because the name returned is just `pkgname` (no arch).
