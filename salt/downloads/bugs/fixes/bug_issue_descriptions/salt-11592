Seems if I test a state like so:

salt hostname state.sls state.sls test=True

and then try this:

salt hostname state.sls state.sls

It still runs it with test as true. If I run it with test=False and then without specifying the parameter it runs not in test mode. It looks like the test state is getting preserved between calls somehow.
