Either `salt-bootstrap` failed to install it, but the `col` command is not available, by default, on Debian systems. This is causing `systemd` `service.get_all` to fail silently when listing actual `systemd` services, and return only the legacy ones.

The command is referenced several times; see here:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2015.8.2/salt/modules/systemd.py#L76

Installing the package `bsdmainutils` resolves the issue.

It seems that this dependency should either be removed and replaced with a python equivalent, or `bsdmainutils` should installed. I'd be inclined towards the former.
- Affected versions: `2015.8.1` and `2015.8.2`
- Bootstrapped with: bootstrap stable (today, Nov 18)

Thank you!
