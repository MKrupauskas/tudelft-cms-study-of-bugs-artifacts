### Description of Issue/Question

I'm testing 2018.3.0 and have run into an issue with the grafana4 states - I'm getting:
```  The State execution failed to record the order in which all states were executed. The state return missing data is:
  {u'changes': {},
   u'comment': u"An exception occurred in this state: 'Changes' should be a dictionary.",
   u'name': u'later',
   u'result': False}
```
from the grafana4_user.present and grafana4_org.present states.


### Setup

1. Set up grafana4.
2. Apply a state such as this:
```
test grafana org:
  grafana4_org.present:
    - name: 'Test'
    - users:
        admin: Admin

test grafana user:
  grafana4_user.present:
    - name: test
    - password: 'somepass'
    - is_admin: False
    - email: 'test@localhost'
```




### Steps to Reproduce Issue

On the first run, the above state will create the Test org (even with `test=true` on the `state.apply`). On a subsequent run, it will return:
```
# salt-call state.apply grafana.test test=false
local:
The State execution failed to record the order in which all states were executed. The state return missing data is:
{u'changes': {},
 u'comment': u"An exception occurred in this state: 'Changes' should be a dictionary.",
 u'name': u'later',
 u'result': False}
