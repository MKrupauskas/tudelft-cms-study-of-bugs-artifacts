When we rebooted our salt-master VM and got connection problems completely out of the blue  ("Is the salt master running?" on the master itself, salt-call timing out, etc.).

This was in the logs of a `-l debug` run:

```
[INFO    ] Starting Salt worker process 0

```

I tracked this down to a `root:root` permission on `/var/run/salt` (and 0770 permissions) instead of `salt:root` but the error was not helping at all.

Can a check be added?
