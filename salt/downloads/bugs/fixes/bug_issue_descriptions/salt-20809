I've been helping work on a security baseline implemented via salt and saw that salt has the start of a pam module. But it appears salt will only load the module if `libpam.so` exists at `/usr/lib/libpam.so`. On a CentOS system with the 64bit version of the pam rpm, the corresponding file exists in `/lib64`. I'm not sure that `os.path.exists` will have the desired behavior anyway, though, since the file is really `/lib64/libpam.so.0` and is a symlink to `/lib64/libpam.so.0.82.2`. Any idea why this loading restriction is in there?

```
def __virtual__():
    '''
    Only load the module if iptables is installed
    '''
    if os.path.exists('/usr/lib/libpam.so'):
        return 'pam'
    return False
```

```
# salt-call --local pam.read_file /etc/pam.d/system-auth
Function pam.read_file is not available
```
