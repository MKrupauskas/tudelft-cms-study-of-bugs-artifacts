Running 2014.7.0 and encountering the following error when trying to salt-call state.highstate on a minion where the users salt-formula is trying to add a user with a fullname containing UTF-8 characters Å or Ø

Seems to be similar to other problems reported with UTF-8, but the error seems to lie elsewhere in my case.

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
