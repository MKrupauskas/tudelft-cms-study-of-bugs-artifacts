### Description of Issue/Question
I'm in the process of upgrading to 2018.3.3, and see these errors in the master log:
```
2018-12-06 18:31:33,825 [salt.loader      :1698][ERROR   ][21774] Failed to load function {'cmd': '_file_envs'}.envs because its module ({'cmd': '_file_envs'}) is not in the whitelist: [u'gitfs', u'roots']
2018-12-06 18:31:33,825 [salt.loader      :1698][ERROR   ][21774] Failed to load function {'cmd': '_file_envs.envs because its module ({'cmd': '_file_envs) is not in the whitelist: [u'gitfs', u'roots']
```
I am unsure if this is causing any actual problems, because everything seems to work.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Any state.sls call will trigger the errors, even with a very simple SLS, such as:
```
Simple test:
  test.nop
```
