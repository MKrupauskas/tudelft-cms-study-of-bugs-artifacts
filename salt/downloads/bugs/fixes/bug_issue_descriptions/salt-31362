`salt-key` returns error when not run as root

I'm attempting to run as salt as unprivileged user described [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/nonroot.html). Regular `salt` commands run without problem, but running `salt-key` commands returns this error:

```
$ salt-key -L
CRITICAL: Salt configured to run as user "root" but unable to switch.
```

I'm running Centos 7 (using the most recent base Centos AMI on AWS). I experienced this with salt versions 2015.5.8 and 2015.8.7. I initially installed 2015.5.8 using the salt packages in EPEL, and then upgraded to 2015.8.7 using the package in the [repo.saltstack.com](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/rhel.html) after first experiencing the issue.

I can see that the salt master daemon is running as the correct unprivileged user, and regular `salt` commands seemingly work, so it appears that salt is configured correctly
