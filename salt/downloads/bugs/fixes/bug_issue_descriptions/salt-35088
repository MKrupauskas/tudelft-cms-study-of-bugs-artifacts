### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

A node with a tag containing the letter "Ø" crashes the command salt-cloud -m maps/mymap.map
We have a similar setup in development, but in production that letter is here, since it is in the name of the account admin. 
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Simply create a tag on any node in your setup containing the letter "Æ, Ø or Å" (copy from this text)

The error you se when you run the command with "-l debug" is as follows:

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to execute 'ec2.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xd8' in position 165422: ordinal not in range(128)

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xd8' in position 165422: ordinal not in range(128)

```

The unicode character for xd8 is "Ø". But why is this using ascii encoding and not unicode? Would this not fail if there are tags in German, Icelandic, Russian, Chinese etc..???
