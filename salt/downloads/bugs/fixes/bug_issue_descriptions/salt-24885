Running the latest commit off the 2015.5 branch, given this master config:

``` yml
root_dir: .
cachedir: .cache
```

The cache will be written to `./cache` instead of `./.cache`.

I'm actually fairly sure this wasn't the behaviour in previous versions of 2015.5, I'll investigate a bit to see if I can find a relevant change in the code.

EDIT: I was mistaken, this seems to be the consistent behaviour as long as `root_dir` is set to `.`.
