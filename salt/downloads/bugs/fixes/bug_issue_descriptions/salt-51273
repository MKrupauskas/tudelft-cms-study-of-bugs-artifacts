### Description of Issue/Question

In 2019.2 Fluorine, when I call just a `ping.test` using `auto` authentication, but also want to insert a metadata in there, now I get crash at master: 

```
salt.exceptions.SaltInvocationError: 'metadata' is an invalid keyword  argument for
'salt.loaded.int.auth.auto.auth'
```

This is the reproducer:

```
curl http://localhost:9080/run \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '[{"eauth": "auto", "tgt":"*", "password":"", "metadata":"Have some donuts!", \
    "tgt_type":"glob", "client":"local", "fun":"test.ping", "username":"admin"}]'
```

As you can see, I want my `test.ping` also eat some donuts metadata. So essentially, I send the following JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "eauth": "auto",
    "tgt": "*",
    "username":"admin",
    "password": "",
    "metadata": "Have some donuts!",
    "tgt_type": "glob",
    "client": "local",
    "fun": "test.ping"
  }
]
```

So since [documentation says](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html#salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.app.Run) "accept username/password/eauth **OR** token", I would expect that metadata should be set alongside with the username and password. But instead of 200/true I receive 500/ISE error.

In current design there seem two ways of fixing this:

- Add "metadata" keyword to the [white-list of of allowed keywords](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/auth/__init__.py#L41-L52) (and then this works).
- Make all authentication modules [accept also `**kwargs`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/auth/auto.py#L8).

But to me both ways seem wrong. Because nor I want some metadata throw donuts at my authentication module, neither I like to throw at my authentication module literally everything.

This sort of API request would probably make more sense:

```json
[
  {
    "eauth": {
        "password": "",
        "username": "admin",
        "module": "auto"
    },
    "client": "local",
    "fun": "test.ping",
    "metadata": "Have some donuts!",
    "tgt_type": "glob",
    "tgt": "*"
  }
]
```

But at the moment I do not know which way we would like to fix it (without reverting everything on this topic back to 2018.3 when it was working). @thatch45 @garethgreenaway @dwoz  any ideas here?
