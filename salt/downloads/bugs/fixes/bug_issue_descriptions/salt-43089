### Description of Issue/Question
I tried to install tornado api in a multimaster multi syndic environment but when trying to target \* from API the only results coming back are from the minions on the syndic.
Doing so from the command line works fine.

In general I don't really understand why there is a call to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/netapi/rest_tornado/saltnado.py#L928

Instead of just trying to gather all events and then figure what to do with minions that are not responding or are slow. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install multimaster-syndic ( 2-2 ). 
Install minions connected to the syndics.
Setup tornado to one master.
Try to do a \* test.ping and see that only syndics reply.
