We are using salt and salt-cloud with EC2 instance. For our CentOS and RedHat instances, the current upstart script does not launch the daemon automatically.

Here is the default setting of salt-minion.conf
start on (net-device-up
          and local-filesystems
          and runlevel [2345])

We have to change the above block to 
start on runlevel [2345]
to get the upstart work.

Anyone encounters the same issue?
