**Description**
In 3001, we regularly ran highstates (both with test=true and without) on 100+ minions without issues.  In 3002, running a highstate on anything more than a handful of minions returns ( for example):

```
salt \* state.highstate test=true
...
mysql-88f7918c-4e1c-5919-b50e-3c5fde2f6620:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
    The minions may not have all finished running and any remaining minions will return upon completion. To look up the return data for this job later, run the following command:

    salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20201022192839822812
...
```

Predictably, when attempting to re-run the high state, again, it returns:
```
salt \* state.highstate test=true
...
keystone-20931cd4-ebf7-5327-8c09-0b9967411822:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 1912 and was started at 2020, Oct 22 19:28:39.822812 with jid 20201022192839822812
...
```

When running high states in batch mode (b=20, for example), everything completes as expected.  Haven't quite figured out what the sweet spot is for works/doesn't work in terms of concurrent runs, but we are still playing with it.

**Setup**
Normal single master setup, install from packages using salt-bootstrap.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run highstate with numerous (100+) minions

**Expected behavior**
Highstates return cleanly
