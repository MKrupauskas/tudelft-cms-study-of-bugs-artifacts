### Description of Issue/Question

Running master/minion version 2015.8.7 my state.orchestrate or state.highstate run fails every time after I revert my minions to a clean state when initiating from master.

The full log from minion1 (1 of 3) can be found at:

The shortened exception block is:

```

```

This error happens on the first highstate call for a clean minion, happens _every time_ I start with a clean minion but does not error on any subsequent highstate calls, only the first one.

The only search result I saw was from 2 or 3 years ago relating to a duplicate minion id in the top.sls file, but I have double checked that I don't have a duplicate.

The error from the master's perspective is simply:

```
Minion did not return. [No response]
```

likely due to the exception.  The failure scenarios happen ONLY when initiating highstate from master.

   FAIL - From master run state.orchestration (fails for minion1)
   FAIL - From master run state.highstate targeting minion1
   PASS - From minion1, run state.highstate

If you need the specific state files I'd prefer sending a ZIP via email.
