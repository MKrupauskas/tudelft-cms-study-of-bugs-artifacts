Steps to reproduce:
Give iptables a source of `!ip-10-0-0-0.ec2.internal/16`

What happens:
Source gets formatted to `! --source ip-10-0-0-0.ec2.ieral/16`

What should happen:
Source gets formatted to `! --source ip-10-0-0-0.ec2.internal/16`

This is probably due to a typo in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/iptables.py where `bang_not_pat` is set. (Line 146 currently)

It's currently written as `re.compile(r'[!|not]\s?')` which I think should be something like `re.compile(r'(!|not)\s?')`. I'll check if that's right and submit a PR.
