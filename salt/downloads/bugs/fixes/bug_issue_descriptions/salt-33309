## Background

JIDs in Salt are currently generated from the Salt Master's current timezone. This makes it difficult or (practically) impossible for consumers of Salt to reconcile a job timestamp with the user's relative local time -- specifically programmatic consumers like via returners or salt-api.

(Please comment with corrections if I am mistaken with anything above!)

What would the potential fallout be for switching Salt to store JIDs in UTC in the next major Salt release?
### Initial thoughts

There would be an increased risk for JID collisions for a window of time after users upgrade to this version (I think just the offset of the user's current time and UTC). That risk is already pretty low, but something to consider anyway.
### Alternate ideas
- Leave the JID as-is and add a new field to the job cache with a UTC timestamp.
  
  Safer but less "single source of truth"-y.
- Expose the Salt Master's timezone via a Runner or a salt-api endpoint and let the end-users do the math.
  
  Safer for Salt but a PITA for users. Also likely fraught with edge-cases and mistakes.
