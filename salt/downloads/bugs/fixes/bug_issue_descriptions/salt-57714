**Description**
Somewhere between 3000.1 and 3001 the `virtual` grains got broken on illumos.
It only ever gets set to `physical` which is the default fallback if i am not mistaken.

**Setup**
Running salt 3001 inside a SmartOS zone.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
[root@cronos ~]# /opt/salt3001/bin/salt-call grains.get virtual
local:
    physical
```

**Expected behavior**
```
[root@cronos ~]# /opt/salt3000/bin/salt-call grains.get virtual
local:
    zone
```

**Additional context**
I tried tracing it back but the diff between the too was rather confusing, there were some changes for Solaris LDOM which might have effected this, but AFAIK they don't.

I did do some debugging with pudb and it seems we now ever make it to  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b95213ec903402f25c1e0aeb3990fe8452ab63ce/salt/grains/core.py#L912 which we did in the past.
