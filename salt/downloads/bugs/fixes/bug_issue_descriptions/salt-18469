Currently, `salt.modules.zpool.create` doesn't have the ability to set the zpool property at creation time. According to the zpool manpage,  "The only property supported at the moment is `ashift`" which can only be specified at creation time and cannot be set later.

Add an option `ashift=value` to `salt.modules.zpool.create`

I will be working on this. Lookout for a PR.

Thanks to @chruck for bringing this issue into my notice via email.
