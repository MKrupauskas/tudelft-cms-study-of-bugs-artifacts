### Description of Issue/Question
The Joyent driver, as well as any driver using `apache-libcloud`, does not currently work when using Python 3.

Details for this issue can be found in [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-jenkins/issues/396#issuecomment-307254420) and [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-jenkins/issues/396#issuecomment-307430483). This problem was initially found with the Joyent salt-cloud driver, as explained in issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt-jenkins/issues/396, but this also affects gce, cloudstack, dimensiondata, and openstack.

This is happening on the Nitrogen branch when running `salt-cloud` with the aforementioned drivers when running with Python 3. Python 2 still works fine.

I am going to add a note to the Nitrogen release notes as a known issue for the time being, until we can get this fixed. I will link the issue when I have submitted the PR.
