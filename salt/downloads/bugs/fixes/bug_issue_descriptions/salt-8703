Looks like this can actually occur, when `perms` is empty/unspecified.

```
************* Module salt.states.rabbitmq_user
salt/states/rabbitmq_user.py:91: [W0631(undefined-loop-variable), present] Using possibly undefined loop variable 'vhost'
```

In case line numbers differ:

```
changes['new'] += ' {0} {1} {2}'.format(vhost, name, tags)
```
