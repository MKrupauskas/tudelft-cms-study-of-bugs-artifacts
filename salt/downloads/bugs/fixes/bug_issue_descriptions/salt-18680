In some cases, `file.replace` will wipe the content of the file completely:
- Create `/tmp/replace-test`:
  
  ```
  #hello=world
  #foo=bar
  #blah=blub
  ```
- Run:
  
  `salt-call --local file.replace /tmp/replace-test pattern='^#foo=bar$' repl='foo=bar search_only=True`
- Inspect the contents of `/tmp/replace-test`

The file is now completely empty.

I was able to reproduce this with `2014.7.0` on Debian and the latest version (dd92b094) of `salt/modules/file.py` from `2014.7`.
