Hi All,

Is see this message when applying a single state, but not all the time. Seems it's related to a template (file) being updated.

---

```
    warnings:
        - '__reqs__' is an invalid keyword argument for 'service.mod_watch'. If you were trying to pass additional data to be used in a template context, please populate 'context' with 'key: value' pairs. Your approach will work until Salt Lithium is out. Please update your state files.
```

I love the idea to be able to use variables in jinja templates without the need to address them in the managed file directive in my SLS files.

Is Salt moving to or away from the context key,value dict concept in the SLS file?

If this is a bug and there's anything else I need to provide please let me know.

Regards,

Gerard.
