It seems that the Salt package that's in the Arch community repo is using a custom PID file path (e.g. /run/salt/salt-minion.pid vs /run/salt-minion.pid). See the [PKGBUILD](https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/salt#n52)

This causes salt-cloud to fail during salt bootstrap on an Arch guest.

```

```

And the output from `journalctl`:

```

```

I've verified that the `/etc/salt/minion` copied into the created VM includes the incorrect `pidfile` for this Arch package (ignoring the `/var/run`, since that's just a symlink to `/run` in Arch these days).

```
[root@demoinstance ~]# grep pidfile /etc/salt/minion.pacorig 
pidfile: /var/run/salt-minion.pid
```

I'm not sure whether this is a "bug" here or in the Arch package. I'm inclined to agree with the use of `/run/salt/salt-minion.pid` vs `/run/salt-minion.pid`, personally.
