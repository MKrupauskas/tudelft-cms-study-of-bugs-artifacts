### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

_Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info)._

`/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/my-instance`

```

server/us-east-1b:
  extends: aws-defaults
  size: t2.micro
  grains:
  availability_zone: us-east-1b
  network_interfaces:
    - DeviceIndex: 0
      PrivateIpAddresses:
        - Primary: True
      SubnetId: <redacted>
      SecurityGroupId:
        - <redacted>
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

If I try and create an instance with this configuration, then `salt-cloud` reports `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'copy'`. It's happening here, on like 2510:

```
salt/config.py

2505 |     if vm_ and name:
2506 |         # Let's get the value from the profile, if present
2507 |         if 'profile' in vm_ and vm_['profile'] is not None:
2508 |             if name in opts['profiles'][vm_['profile']]
2509 |                 if isinstance(value, dict):
2510 |                     value.update(opts['profiles'][vm_['profile']][name].copy())
2511 |                 else:
2512 |                     value = deepcopy(opts['profiles'][vm_['profile']][name])
2513 | 
```

The issue is that a valueless key is interpretted as None. While this is an error, the error message being reported is very cryptic and hard to debug. We've encountered this twice.
