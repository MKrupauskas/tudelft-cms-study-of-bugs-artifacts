Hey hey, asked about this on the mailing list and was told to post here as I didn't see any other issues reporting this. It seems like the rbenv state isn't loading in correctly. Here's my super basic implementation:

```
ruby-{{ pillar['ruby']['version'] }}:
  rbenv.installed:
    - default: True
```

...when I run this, it throws an error about not being able to find the rbenv state. It seems like it is present in the source, which is confusing.

For a more thorough way to reproduce, check out [this file](https://github.com/jenius/salt-config/blob/master/ruby/init.sls), which runs through installation of rbenv then tries to use the `rbenv.installed` state to install a specific version. You'll notice that in that particular file, the `rbenv.installed` line is commented out, and the manual commands required to install it are run below, but of course I would much rather make this simpler by just using the native salt command if possible.
