I assume this is is only a `salt-ssh` issue but haven't tested the other clients. Highstate runs are currently very verbose, while `state.sls` runs output as normal.

```
vagrant-dev:
    ----------
    apache_module_|-apache-mod-expires_|-expires_|-enable:
        ----------
        __run_num__:
            52
        changes:
            ----------
        comment:
            expires already enabled.
        duration:
            0.378
        name:
            expires
        result:
            True
        start_time:
            15:16:32.082942
[...]
```

Furthermore, like half the outputters specified with `--out` have errors. I can provide examples of the error output if you like, but they seem easily reproducible.
