In this example I use `- cmd.run: B` instead of `- cmd: B`, and it's a very easy to make error IMHO.

<pre>
A:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo A second
    - require_in:
      # right syntax is cmd: C
      - cmd.run: B

B:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo B first
</pre>


Now this makes the require_in command silently ignored, and the syntax error is not even detected.
