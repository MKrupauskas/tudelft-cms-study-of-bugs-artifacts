I configured a multi-master setup using the following documentation: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster.html

When using a non failover multi-master setup.. the first time my minion connects to the masters I get the following error:

```
2015-12-16 15:43:00,666 [salt.crypt       ][ERROR   ][21494] The master failed to decrypt the random minion token
2015-12-16 15:43:00,666 [salt.crypt       ][CRITICAL][21494] The Salt Master server's public key did not authenticate!
The master may need to be updated if it is a version of Salt lower than 2015.8.3, or
If you are confident that you are connecting to a valid Salt Master, then remove the master public key and restart the Salt Minion.
The master public key can be found at:
/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub

2015-12-16 15:43:00,668 [salt.scripts     ][WARNING ][21494] ** Restarting minion **
```

There was no `salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub` when it initially connected but after I verify that the `salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub` exists and is the right one. Subsequent restarts of the minion do not result in this error if I leave the minion_master.pub file as-is. If I remove the file I again get the above error.

Connecting to a single master works fine in both scenarios above.. so it would seem that there is some sort of race condition with multi-master authentication when it tries to verify the public key of the master.

Both masters have the same .pem and .pub keys.

I will look into pre-populating that minion_master.pub key to work around this issue.. but it would be great to know if there is a proper fix that I do not know about or a configuration option I can set to help.

My minion config looks like so:

```
random_reauth_delay: 60
recon_default: 1000
recon_max: 5000
recon_randomize: True
keysize: 2048
startup_states: highstate
master:
  - smaster1-dusw.downlynk.com
  - smaster2-dusw.downlynk.com
grains:
  ultype: smaster
  ulsite: downlynk
id: dusw1-smaster00
```

I'm using the following version

```
