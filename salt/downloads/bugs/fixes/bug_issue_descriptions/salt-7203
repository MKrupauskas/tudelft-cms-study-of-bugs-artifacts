Hello,

Trying to define a Yum repository with pkgrepo on CentOS 5 (salt version 0.16.4), I get a "global name 'os' is not defined" error. I think I have traced the problem to yumpkg5.py wrapping list_repos with:

```
list_repos = _namespaced_function(list_repos, globals())
```

but not importing the os module, so the globals dict it passes does not contain it and calling pkg.list_repos then fails with the above error.

Adding "import os" near the top of salt/modules/yumpkg5.py fixes the problem for me.
