**Note:** This bug was fixed in 3c2a330a16820d096d79eb926259c672194a2e50, however this commit was never included in any 2015.5 release. It would be very much appreciated if this fix could be included in one of the next releases as it makes the zypper module difficult to use.

The zypper module's list_upgrades function is broken in v2015.5.\* (tested on v2015.5.2, but bug still present in v2015.5.3):
