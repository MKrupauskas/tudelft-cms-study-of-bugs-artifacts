On Gentoo, multiple versions of a single package can be installed at the same time using Portage's `SLOT` capabilities.
This is exposed in `state.pkg.installed` through the `slot` parameter (provided by `modules.ebuild`).

When a package which provides more than 1 slot is installed in one of the provided slots, installing another version into its slot is impossible as `state.pgk.installed` claims it would be already installed.

The manual query of Gentoo's package DB provides this output:

```
moria ~ # eix -e media-libs/tiff
[I] media-libs/tiff
     Available versions:  
     (3)    3.9.7-r1
     (0)    4.0.3-r6
     Installed versions:  4.0.3-r6(11:55:15 PM 02/05/2014)
     Homepage:            http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/
     Description:         Tag Image File Format (TIFF) librar
```

This shows, the package `media-libs/tiff` is available in two slots, where `0` is the default slot and `3` provides the ability to install the older `3.x` generation of the package at the same time.

Besides that, it also shows that version `4.0.3-r6` is currently installed in slot `0`.

Now, the package `media-libs/tiff` should also be installed in slot `3` using `pkg.installed`.
As the result shows, `pkg.installed` doesn't do anything further, as it determines the package is already installed (although in another slot), ignoring the specific request for `slot=3`:

```

This was tested on `develop` 0d8f2a54254f57f9173d85145ddfebb20c0741d7, but also affects at least `2014.1` (reported by a user on IRC running `2014.1.11`) and most likely `2014.7` too.

The slot of a package in `modules.ebuild` can be retrieved using:

``` Python
# query the DB of installed packages for the slot of the current CPV
# and split off any sub-SLOTs (e.g. 3/0.17 to 3)
cpv_slot = _vartree().dbapi.aux_get(cpv, ['SLOT'])[0].split('/', 1)[0]
```

The `CPV` is a full package atom consisting of:
- the package's category: `media-libs`
- the package's name: `tiff`
- the package's full version: `4.0.3-r6`
  combined into a unicode-string: `u'media-libs/tiff-4.0.3-r6'`

I'm not sure, whether any Gentoo/Portage specific code should be added to `state.pkg.installed` to deal with this or what's the proper approach to get this working - ideas welcome.
