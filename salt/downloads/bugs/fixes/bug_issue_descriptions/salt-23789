2014.7.5: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c81f4445c5c94f9ed0f5

2015.5.0: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/41f6b28cecde6cef5129

System CentOS 7.1:
Salt packages from EPEL (2015-05-15)

On master:

``` console
[root@hperhlws0802 orchestration]# rpm -qa |grep salt 
salt-2015.5.0-1.el7.noarch
salt-master-2015.5.0-1.el7.noarch
salt-minion-2015.5.0-1.el7.noarch
```

Difficult to debug, because , 
1. Output is not ordered in the order of execution
2. Some information is missing
3. I'm generally missing some output of some orchestration states (probably I oversee because of the reordering)

P.S.: Me feeling they are reordered by name of orchestration state
