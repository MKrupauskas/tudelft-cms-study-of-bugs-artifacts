### Description of Issue/Question

Setting up multiple directories to be watched in inotify beacon functions pretty well except when you have to have an exclude for each directory. 


Each of the setups works 100% correctly when on their own.
```
  inotify:
  - files:
      /etc/zabbix:
        auto_add: true
        exclude:
          - /etc/zabbix/.+?\.sw[px]*$|4913|~$:
              regex: true
        mask:
          - modify
          - delete
        recurse: true
      /etc/ssh:
        auto_add: true
        exclude:
          - /etc/ssh/.+?\.sw[px]*$|4913|~$:
              regex: true
        mask:
          - modify
          - delete
        recurse: true
  - disable_during_state_run: true
  - coalesce: true
```
But when combined the zabbix check triggers for the vim swap files. 



### Setup
Setup beacons for more than one directy and put regex excludes in both.
then try and edit something in each one.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
See the config above. Use that and edit something in the zabbix directory. While using trace on the minion. 

```

salt/beacon/salt00.wolfnet.bad4.us/inotify//etc/zabbix  {
    "_stamp": "2019-02-15T20:03:18.916590",
    "change": "IN_MODIFY",
    "id": "salt00.wolfnet.bad4.us",
    "path": "/etc/zabbix/.zabbix_agentd.conf.swp"
}
```

Of note. editing the ssh regex to catch all swap files results in the following exclude. 

```

[TRACE   ] Beacon processing: inotify
[TRACE   ] Evaluting if beacon inotify should be skipped due to a state run.
