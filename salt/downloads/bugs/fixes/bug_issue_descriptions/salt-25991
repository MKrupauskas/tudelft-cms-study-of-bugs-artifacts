Edit: I have confirmed this issue on 2015.8.0rc3 and @mimianddaniel on 2015.5.3, so I am increasing the priority and severity.  I have also seen this happen on a remote minion upon the event of the master accepting its key.

Occasionally, when running the latest develop branch, I encounter these errors in the minion log.  The minion and master are running on the same system and the minion has been restarted a few seconds after the master was restarted.
