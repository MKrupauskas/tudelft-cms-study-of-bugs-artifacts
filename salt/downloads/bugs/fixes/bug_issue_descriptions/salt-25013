if salt-minion -d is run multiple times on the same machine then a duplicate process will be created.  When the salt-master runs a command on the minions, it will run once for each instance of salt-minion -d.

Ideally, the "salt-minion -d" command would kill the previous daemon and then start up again, else see that there is already a daemon running and not create a new instance
