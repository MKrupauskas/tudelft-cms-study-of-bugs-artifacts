Hi,

I tried to follow the instructions at https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/renderers/all/salt.renderers.gpg.html to the letter, but I got stuck with:

```

```

So it does a decryption on the master at least once, which succeeds, but is ignored. And then the run on the minion mucks it up somehow.

I must be doing something wrong because https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/19114 indicates this should be working... but what? What is making it run on the minion? Did I miss something obvious in the documentation?

This is with 2016.11.3.

TIA.
