I have an orchestration which relies on a pillar. The pillar correctly renders on the master via pillar.get, but does not render inside the orchestration.

``` bash
ahammond@salt.anchorfree.net[salt]:~ $ sudo salt-call pillar.get branch_based
local:
    ----------
    lookup:
        ----------
        deploy_master:
            - af_rdr_rules
            - ... snip ...
```

Skip to the bottom for the interesting stuff.

``` bash
ahammond@salt.anchorfree.net[salt]:~ $ sudo salt-run --log-level=debug state.orch orchestration.branch_based pillar='{"reactor_tag": "af/build/uploaded/ar/af_rdr_rules/stage"}' saltenv=fix_bbcd

state.sls gets the pillar correctly. Thoughts?
