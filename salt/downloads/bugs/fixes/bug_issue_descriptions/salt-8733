I can see in the debug output that salt-ssh is aware of pillar data that gets applied to '*' in pillar top.sls, but it doesn't seem to be aware of pillar data that gets applied to a specific minion id. I was hoping that salt-ssh would use the `host` configured in the roster file when matching against the minion id, but that doesn't seem to be the case, and hence many of my states (that make use of per-minion pillar data) don't work over salt-ssh.
