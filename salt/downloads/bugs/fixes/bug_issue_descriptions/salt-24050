**_NOTE:**_ The original test steps do not work anymore because "salt-call" always gives you the latest data. But this still is broken when you run the pillar calls (pillar.item and pillar.get) from the master.

If you change pillar data, and then run state.highstate (via salt or salt-call), the pillar data will not be refreshed on the minion cache. It was my understanding that a state.highstate run should update pillar minion cache.

To test this, run "salt-call pillar.get key"
Change the value of that key.
Verify it has changed by running "salt-call pillar.item key"  (You use pillar.item because it will use a refreshed pillar value instead of cached item).
Run state.highstate any way you like.
Verify the minion cache has NOT been updated with "salt-call pillar.get key".
Run a "salt-call saltutil.refresh_pillar" to update minion pillar cache.
Verify the minion cache has now been successfully updated with "salt-call pillar.get key".

(To know the difference between pillar.get and pillar.item, please refer to this issue. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/21765)

Tested in 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
