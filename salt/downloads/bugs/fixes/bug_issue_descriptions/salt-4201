if you run pip install -e by hand it appears like this in the console:

```
Obtaining South from git+git://github.com/lambdafu/django-south.git@7bb081348d854d0b1aa82b87da5b446ad5d6f2a6#egg=South-dev (from -r requirements.txt (line 5))
  git clone in ./src/south exists with URL git://github.com/clones/django-south.git
  The plan is to install the git repository git://github.com/lambdafu/django-south.git
What to do?  (s)witch, (i)gnore, (w)ipe, (b)ackup 
```

to prevent that, pip got this flag:

```
 --exists-action <EXISTS_ACTION>
     Default action when a path already exists. Use this option more than one time to specify
     another action if a certain option is not available. Choices: (s)witch, (i)gnore, (w)ipe,
     (b)ackup
```

pip.installed should have this flag --exists-action w
