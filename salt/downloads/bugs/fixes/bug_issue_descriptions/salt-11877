I have some debian containers that are not detected as virtual machines. They don't have what grains are looking for to detect an OpenVZ platform:

```
ls -laR /proc/vz/
/proc/vz/:
total 0
dr-xr-xr-x  3 root root 0 Apr  9 16:53 .
dr-xr-xr-x 84 root root 0 Feb 25  2013 ..
dr-x------  8 root root 0 Apr  9 16:53 vzaquota

/proc/vz/vzaquota:
total 0
dr-x------ 8 root root 0 Apr  9 16:53 .
dr-xr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Apr  9 16:53 ..
```

On the other hand they have `/proc/user_beancounters` - though that file is present both on containers and the host box
