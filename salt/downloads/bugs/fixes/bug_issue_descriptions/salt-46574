### False detection of Xen on a physical server

### Setup
After kernel upgrade to 4.9.65+deb9u3 (Debian) /sys/bus/xen directory appeared, however no xen drivers loaded.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Salt incorrectly detects "Xen PV DomU" due to presence of /sys/bus/xen and below `dmesg` output:
```
$ dmesg | grep -i xen:
[5870288.334711] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_UP): vethLNMXEN: link is not ready
[5870288.391442] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): vethLNMXEN: link becomes ready
```

```
$ salt-call --local grains.get virtual virtual_subtype
local:
    xen
$ salt-call --local grains.get virtual_subtype
local:
    Xen PV DomU
```

As you see, `vethNMXEN` is not related to Xen at all, it is just random name for the virtual network interface used by LXC containers.
