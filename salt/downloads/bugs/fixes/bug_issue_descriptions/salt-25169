If the name of the Brick exceeds a single line, this command breaks because there are no brick,port,online,pid values to split.

You can probably solve this by using libgfapi, but you guys don't seem to use external dependencies.

To clarify: In line 229 of /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/glusterfs.py, your command is cmd = 'gluster volume status {0}'.format(name).  That gives you a table like this:

```
# gluster volume status test-volume
Status of volume: test-volume
Gluster process                        Port    Online   Pid
------------------------------------------------------------
Brick arch:/export/rep1                24010   Y       18474
Brick arch:/export/rep2                24011   Y       18479
NFS Server on localhost                38467   Y       18486
Self-heal Daemon on localhost          N/A     Y       18491
```

On line 240 you check if line.startswith('Brick'):, however, there's limited space for a path, such that the line wraps and port, online, and pid are pushed to a second line.  This breaks functionality.
