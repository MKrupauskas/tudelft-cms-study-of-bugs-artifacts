### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

Please note that this is with a 2015.5.9 master and a 2015.5.9 windows minion.
(Sorry if this was fixed in more recent versions. I did a search but didn't find anything
pertaining to this).
Ok here is a state formula that should work (I think) but results in tracebacks when used
on a Windows minion.

```
firefox installed:
   pkg.installed:
      - refresh: True
      - pkgs:
           - firefox-esr: 38.7.1
```

If I do a state.apply,
then I get the following output

```
    pkg_|-firefox installed_|-firefox installed_|-installed:
        ----------
        __run_num__:
            0
        changes:
            ----------
