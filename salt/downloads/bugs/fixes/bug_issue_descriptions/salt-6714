i made a mistake in /etc/salt/minion by forgetting a blank after the colon of:

<pre>
append_domain:example.com
</pre>


salt was not connecting to master.
the message in /var/log/minion was completely unhelpful:

<pre>
2013-08-15 10:41:18,066 [salt.utils       ][ERROR   ] This master address: 'salt' was previously resolvable but now fails to resolve! The previously resolved ip addr will continue to be used
2013-08-15 10:41:18,066 [salt.minion      ][WARNING ] Master hostname: salt not found. Retrying in 30 seconds
</pre>

this indiates that the config is ignored completely, as salt is the default master (but not in my setup).

running:
<pre>
appstack1 cache # salt-call test.ping

  in "<string>", line 58, column 1:

this message actually was helpful and should go into the log.
