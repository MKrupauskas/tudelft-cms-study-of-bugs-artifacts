Due to mount.nfs hanging when the NFS server isn't ready, I am not letting the mounted state do the actual mount and run the mount command later using the fstab entry.
mkmnt in this case has no effect and the mount from fstab fails.

In my understanding the state should set up everything for the mount to work from fstab, except execute the mount command. So mkmnt should still be meaningful.

Alternatively, someone could introduce a timeout to mount that kills the mount command if it doesn't return after that timeout has passed, but even then the behaviour of mount=False is still unclear and unintuitive.
