"Every SysV-style initscript that starts a resident daemon -- as opposed to those that start tasks (e.g. firstboot and kdump) -- must manage a /var/lock/subsys/<service_name> file. ", see http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:SysVInitScript#Initscript_template

The initscripts in the EPEL packages do not create a /var/lock/subsys file, so the service is not properly shutdown when halting or rebooting the system. This may cause issues, for example if the salt processes are running on a network filesystem.

Update: apparently this is RedHat family specific. SuSE nor Debian use /var/lock/subsys
