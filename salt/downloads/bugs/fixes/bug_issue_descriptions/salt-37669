### Description of Issue/Question
For some reason pkg.refresh_db fails on my minion and I don't know why this is happening. My setup is extremely straight forward. The weirdest thing too was that it worked fine and when I came over the weekend it just stopped working and i don't know what I did to break it. 

### Setup
All right so let's start with the error it throws when i run pkg.refresh_db:

```

This is how my master config file (etc/salt/minion) looks like:


```

state_top: Win10.sls

 The location of the top file
 file_roots:
 base:
    - /srv/salt/

 winrepo_dir: /srv/salt/win/repo-ng

fileserver_backend:
  - git
  - roots

winrepo_dir_ng: '/srv/salt/win/repo-ng'
winrepo_provider: gitpython

```

My repo did have custom definitions for programs which I thought may have caused the issue. I backed up the folders and completely cleared my repo and repo-ng folders. 

I then ran both:
```
sudo salt-run winrepo.update_git_repos
sudo salt-run winrepo.genrepo

```
The process was successful but running pkg.refresh_db failed nonetheless. I tried uninstalling cygwin from my minion (which was what I was installing during all this) and it still does not work.
