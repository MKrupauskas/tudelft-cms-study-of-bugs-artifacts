After upgrading from 16.4 to 17.1, most of our servers stopped running state.highstate commands. We set a 60 second timeout in /etc/salt/master (timeout: 60). Most minions return with the failure error "Minion did not return" after 8-10 seconds, well short of the timeout. 

Running grains.item saltversion or test.ping to a select server works, running a highstate fails. Using time in front of the command shows that the command returns after only a few seconds. 

Running salt -v -t 60 HOST state.highstate fixes the problem.
