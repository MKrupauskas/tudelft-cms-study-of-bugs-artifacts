### Description of Issue/Question

I built a setup with 2 masters and 2 syndics connecting to both of them. The thing is that if salt-master service is restarted on a syndic, it simply stops forwarding job results to the top level masters. The jobs are published and their results are coming back to the local salt-master, which is clearly seen in its log in debug mode. However, salt-syndic no longer forwards the results back to the top level master that initially published the job.
Restarting salt-syndic process fixes the problem but you need to remember to do it in case salt-master is restarted on a syndic. If you don't do that, you may no longer even be able to reach the minion on that syndic to remediate it.
### Setup

Salt 2016.03.1. 4 servers - 2 masters (sharing the same key) and 2 syndics (also sharing the same key - different than the top level masters) connecting to both of them.  Some minions connecting to the syndics in failover mode.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Do a simple setup as decribed above, then restart salt-master on both syndic servers and watch the complete outage of your environment.
### Versions Report

2016.03.1 on RHEL 6.5. All required packages taken from SaltStack repository.
