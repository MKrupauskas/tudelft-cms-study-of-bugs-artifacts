The _has_check function in the iptables module is located here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/iptables.py#L455

This function is very poorly named as it returns True when "--check" should not be used and False when "--check" should be used. This seems backwards from what the function name implies.

Also, the logic seems pretty complex and not very generic. Why not just look for the "--check" text in the "iptables -h" output on module load (in **virtual**, I guess) and use that to determine whether or not to use the "--check" arg?
