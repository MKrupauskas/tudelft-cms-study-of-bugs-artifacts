### Description of Issue/Question
The `queue: True` argument we are trying to pass to a state.apply seems to get ignored, as the minion doesn't run the state saying "The function "state.apply" is running as PID xxxxxx and was started at xxxxxx with jid xxxxxxx". 

### Setup
```
{% set data = data.get('data', {}) %}

security_groups_enabled:
  local.state.apply:
    - tgt: '*salt*'
    - queue: True
    - arg:
      - states/aws/security_groups
    - kwarg:
        pillar:
          security_groups_data: {{ data }}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run above state and observe the minion output; restart master and minion and re-run... no change.
