We are setting up a tiered global salt deployment with a pair of syndics in each datacenter and the primary masters in our primary datacenter. We've got plans to put salt in every datacenter, but are still in the process of getting everything working as we migrate from legacy config management tools.

We want to use gitfs to ensure all of the state / pillar trees are in sync for each master/syndic and are ocassionally having issues with it. We see instances of gitfs not updating and `salt-run fileserver.update` doesn't seem to help.

We've been monitoring this with Icinga and are checking the timestamp on /var/cache/salt/master/gitfs/0405fdedec3d8e4d70771d1d5dc7fa20. Is there a better way to monitor this? Obviously we can't run git log in the directory or it would be super easy to ensure all was up to date. Why not?

It appears that salt is putting down an improper git config as it sets `bare = false` when it is very obviously a bare git repository, but the HEAD ref doesn't exist.
