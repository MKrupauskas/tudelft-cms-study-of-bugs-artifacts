I'm using the https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/salt-formula formula.

```
salt-call state.sls salt.master
```

First Run:

```
----------
          ID: salt-master
    Function: file.recurse
        Name: /etc/salt/master.d
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

Succeeding Runs:

```

          ID: salt-master
    Function: file.recurse
        Name: /etc/salt/master.d
      Result: True

I try to get some more details... I was able to reproduce this on a second node. I was not able to reproduce this by just deleting the created directory.
