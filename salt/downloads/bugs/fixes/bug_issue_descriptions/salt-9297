Until recently we had only been running smaller clusters while developing stackd.io, but last week we had our first major internal adopter that started using it to manage the clusters we need internally for our large-scale integration testing of our company's product. The first "large" cluster was a 50-node Hadoop/HBase cluster along with our own proprietary software and we immediately encountered issue with executing an overstate file that previously worked for smaller test clusters.

I'll try to provide all the information I can, but if I miss something or there are questions please let me know. I would love to figure this out so we can move forward:

``` bash

```
