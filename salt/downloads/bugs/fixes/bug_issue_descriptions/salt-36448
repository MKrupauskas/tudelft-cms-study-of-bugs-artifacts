### Description of Issue/Question

We are heavily using lists encoded as nodegroups. We see a lot of situations where lists fail.
### Setup
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

``` bash
# See our class_pvn nodegroup
ahammond@salt:~$ grep -F class_pvn: /srv/inventory_pillar/nodegroups.conf
  class_pvn: 'L@hss79,hss89,hss133,hss178,hss179,hss169,hss148,hss149,hss188,hss189,hss228,hss229,hss509',
# Note that all minions are up, running and responding when addressed as the nodegroup
ahammond@salt:~$ sudo salt --out=text -N class_pvn test.ping
hss509: True

# Note that the restarted minion responds when address as part of a list.
ahammond@salt:~$ sudo salt --out=text -L hss79,hss89,hss133,hss178,hss179,hss169,hss148,hss149,hss188,hss189,hss228,hss229,hss509 test.ping
