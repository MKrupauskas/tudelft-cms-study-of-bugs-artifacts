### salt.auth.rest response merged doesn't seems to work

Thanks for the work done on Salt that a really nice product.

The rest auth documentation https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/auth/all/salt.auth.rest.html is saying:

> If there are entries underneath the ^url entry then they are merged with any responses from the REST call. In the above example, assuming the REST call does not return any additional ACLs, this will authenticate Fred via a REST call and allow him to run any execution module and all runners.

I've tried many setup and may be the json returned by the rest api is not in proper format, but documentation is may be not clear enough about it.

### Setup

In `/etc/salt/master.d/auth.conf` I've tried the following configuration

```
external_auth:
    rest:
        ^url: http://myauth.service.local
```

With a rest call returning the folowing acl in json:

```
[TRACE   ] Response Text: [".*","@wheel","@jobs","@runner"]
[DEBUG   ] eauth REST call returned 200: {u'body': '[".*","@wheel","@jobs","@runner"]', u'status': 200, u'dict': [u'.*', u'@wheel', u'@jobs', u'@runner']}
[TRACE   ] Compiled auth_list: []
[WARNING ] Authentication failure of type "token" occurred.
```
Compile list is empty. So merrge didn't happen

With the following:

```
[TRACE   ] Response Text: {"fred":[".*","@wheel","@jobs","@runner"]}
[DEBUG   ] eauth REST call returned 200: {u'body': '{"fred":[".*","@wheel","@jobs","@runner"]}', u'status': 200, u'dict': {u'fred': [u'.*', u'@wheel', u'@jobs', u'@runner']}}
[TRACE   ] Compiled auth_list: []
```

Same than previous. With:

```
external_auth:
    rest:
        ^url: http://myauth.service.local
        'fred':
```

I've test with the same json as previous and I've got the following stack trace:

```

```

Error during the merge because list is empty. And with the following configuration with the same two senario of rest reply:

```
external_auth:
    rest:
        ^url: http://myauth.service.local
        'fred':
            - test.ping
```

Reply in both json case is:

```
[TRACE   ] Compiled auth_list: [u'test.ping']
```
So the list define in the `auth.conf` file override everything and is not merged. Or may be the meaning of merge is not the one I'm thinking about or may be my JSON format is not correct so an example of JSON would be much appreciate.
