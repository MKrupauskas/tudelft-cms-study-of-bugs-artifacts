As I see in the source-code, salt cmd.run seems using python subprocess to run a shell cmd, but I strangely find that:

```
salt 'test' cmd.run 'service zabbix-agent restart;'   \# it works but LC_ALL=C, it use different delimtor etc.
salt 'test' service.restart zabbix-agent  \# it works but LC_ALL unset
```

How to set os env var in salt cmd.run?
help~~~
