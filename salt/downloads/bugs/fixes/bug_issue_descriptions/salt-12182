Both my salt-master and salt-minion is 0.17.5, and when I try test.ping on master, it didn't return True:

```
[root@Master salt]# salt 'minion_a' test.ping -v
Executing job with jid 20140422185539931812
-------------------------------------------
minion_a:
    Minion did not return
```

however, minion_a can work by salt-call, such as:

```
[root@minion_a~]# salt-call state.sls basic.announce
[INFO    ] Fetching file ** done ** 'basic/announce.sls'

I had try netstat -ntlap | grep Minion_IP, and it seems that the connection between master and minion lost and cannot test.ping ok any more.BTW, the minion service is still running and I can fix it by restart the salt-minion, but it's really not a good idea.
