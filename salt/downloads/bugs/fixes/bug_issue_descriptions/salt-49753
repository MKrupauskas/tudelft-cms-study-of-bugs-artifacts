### Description of Issue/Question
When using 'prepreq' in orchestration, I can see that the pre-required state first runs with `test=True` and then runs in real, but the pre-requiring state did not run at all.
### Setup
```
orchestration/test.sls

test3:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'region1.freebsd1'
    - sls:
        - myapp.test

test2:
  cmd.run:
    - name: "echo test2"
    - prereq:
      - test3
```
```
myapp/test.sls

/tmp/testfile:
  file.managed:
    - contents: 'abcd'

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
salt-run state.orch orchestration.test -l trace
```
test3 will run twice, first time in test mode, second time in real, but test2 never run.
