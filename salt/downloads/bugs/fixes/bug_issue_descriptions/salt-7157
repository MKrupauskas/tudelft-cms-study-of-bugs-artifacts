For example running:
`salt foobar test.sleep 10`

`t= 0.0` test.sleep starts on foobar minion
`t= 0.0` LocalClient.get_cli_event_returns polls for jid event with timeout = 5s
`t= 5.0` Poll returns None
`t= 5.0` LocalClient runs saltutil.findjob jid with timeout = 5s (blocking)
`t= 5.5` saltutil.findjob returns a match for foobar, timeout += 5s
`t= 5.5` LocalClient polls for jid event with timeout = 10s
`t=15.5` Poll returns None
`t=15.5` Foo returns for jid, event is queued
`t=15.5` LocalClient runs saltutil.findjob jid with timeout = 5s (blocking)
`t=11.0` saltutil.findjob return no match, timeout has expired, LocalClient.get_cli_returns returns no result for foo

Polling for the event one last time (with a very short timeout) resolves most "Minion did not return" issues.
