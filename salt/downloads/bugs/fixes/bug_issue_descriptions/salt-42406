### Description of Issue/Question
init script for rh(I'm guessing other linux flavours too) system as described in https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/logging/index.html#log-file
does not work correctly because of 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/pkg/rpm/salt-minion#L161
which will cause a script error since log_file: udp://loghost:10514 would not be a valid location.

### Setup
rh minion with log_file: udp://loghost:10514

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
stop minion
configure rsyslog
setup minion to send logs to rsyslog 
try to start minion

### Versions Report
latest version including 2016.11 which I believe the init script was changed
