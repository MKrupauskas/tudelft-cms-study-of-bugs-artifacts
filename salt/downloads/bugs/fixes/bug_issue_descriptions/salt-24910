The salt "-T (--make-token)" token flag fails to work with the "external_auth" enabled. This seems to only happen when specifying the LDAP group.  For example:

external_auth:
  ldap:
    mygroup%:
      - '_':
    - ._

On another note, it would be great to have the CLI pick up the user directly from the shell, thus having to avoid specifying --username. Thanks!
