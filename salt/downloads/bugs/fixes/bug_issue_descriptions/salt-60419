### Description of Issue

If the kernel on the minion has builtin KVM modules the `virt._is_kvm_hyper()` function will always return `False`. It is much more robust to check the presence of `/dev/kvm`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `virt.get_hypervisor()` on a KVM host minion where the KVM modules are built into the kernel. This typically is the case for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server aarch64.

Result should be `True` if `libvirtd` is also running on the minion.
