### Description of Issue/Question
If you try to JSON serialize anything that comes from webhook engine it will error out because of bytes string parsing error.

Looks to be Python3/2 inconsistency

### Setup
Engine configured by default:
```
# file: /etc/salt/master.d/engines.conf
engines:
  - webhook:
      port: 8000
      ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
      ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key

# file: /etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf
reactor:
  - 'salt/engines/hook/test-hook':
    - salt://reactor/reactor.sls
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Start salt-master and the engine and execute:
```
curl -sS localhost:8000/hook \
    -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}'
```

Reactor that will handle the event, if there is JSON parsing will error out:
```
b'{"event": "updated", "timestamp": ... "last_updated": "2019-03-29T16:00:35.221076Z"}}' is not JSON serializable
```
