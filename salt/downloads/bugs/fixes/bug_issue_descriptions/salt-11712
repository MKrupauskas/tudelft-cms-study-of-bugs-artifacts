lxc-version was last bundled with LXC 0.9.0. 1.0.0 was released on the 20th of February, but salt v2014.1.1 (which has this issue) was tagged on the 18th of March.

It looks like this is no longer an issue on the develop branch, but that has not been merged into any stable release branch yet. The develop branch docs say "You need lxc >= 1.0 (even beta alpha)", but the v2014.1.1 release says no such thing AFAICT.

It would be great to know (and have documented) exactly which version of LXC the v2014.1.1 release (and future releases) was tested to work with.
