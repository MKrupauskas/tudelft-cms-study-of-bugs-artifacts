As I have about half of server is Windows server and the others is Linux Server . when I  have a common module for both linux and windows OS  but after excute the command 

`salt '*' saltutil.sync_modules`

Linux minion  almost can autoload the salt minion 
but some of my Windows minions can autload the module , some cant autoload ,  everytime I have to restart  the salt minion manually or use other batch tools to restart the salt minion on Window Server , its too bad experience
