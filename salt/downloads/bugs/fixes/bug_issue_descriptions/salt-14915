https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/mount.py#L36

The mount module runs `mount -l` on line 36 (of the develop branch, 2014.1 does the same though) in the _list_mounts function. `-l` is an illegal option on SmartOS/OmniOS (and I assume other illumos distros. 

I believe that it is used for returning the disk labels in [linux](http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+7.0+wheezy&format=html&locale=en). In FreeBSD, `-l` is used "used in conjunction with the -a option, also mount those file systems which are marked as “late”." While it does no harm, it might be best to not use it on FreeBSD as well.

Here is the error output on the minion's logs:

```
