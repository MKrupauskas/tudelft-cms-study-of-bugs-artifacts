### Description of Issue/Question

When running state.low over salt-ssh I see the following exception: `An Exception occurred while executing state.low: 'SSHHighState' object has no attribute 'verify_data'`
### Setup
1. (1) salt-ssh master (1) host without salt setup in roster
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. run `state.low` command which was copied directly from docs:

```
root@ubuntu:~# salt-ssh '*' state.low '{"state": "pkg", "fun": "installed", "name": "vi"}'                                                                                                    
ch3ll-ssh-test:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.low: 'SSHHighState' object has no attribute 'verify_data'
ch3ll-ssh-test2:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.low: 'SSHHighState' object has no attribute 'verify_data'
```

This works when not run over salt-ssh:

```
root@ubuntu:~# salt '*' state.low '{"state": "pkg", "fun": "installed", "name": "vi"}'
