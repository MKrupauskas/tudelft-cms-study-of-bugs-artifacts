Running 0.15.1 on RHEL 64 bit 6.4.

I ran the overstate runner with the configuration below,
the nfs-server state had some kind of a syntax error ( my bad ).

```
Rendering SLS filespace failed, render error: expected '<document start>', but found '<block mapping start>'
```

so the state did ran at all
but even so the application state after it (which require the nfs-server) ran anyway ..

``` yaml
nfs-server:
  match: G@roles:fs
  sls:
    - nfs-server

application:
  match: G@roles:app
  sls:
    - application
  require:
    - nfs-server
```

Thanks,
Ran
