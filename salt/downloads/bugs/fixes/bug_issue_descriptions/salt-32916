### Description of Issue/Question

Trying to use file.managed to get a file from S3 fails if the file is too big for the amount of memory available in the minion.

The problem seems to be caused by this call https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/s3.py#L128 where the request is initialized once and used in different ways depending on the method passed to `query`.

A way to avoid the issue might be using streaming, as documented at http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#body-content-workflow but that will require a bit of refactoring of the query method.
### Versions Report

salt 2015.8.8.2 is definitely affected
