When executing a `salt-key` command at the HEAD (de441aba3503d904377a298696116567e70ce01e) of 2015.2, the follow error occurs at the bottom:

```
Exception TypeError: TypeError("'NoneType' object is not callable",) in <bound method MasterEvent.__del__ of <salt.utils.event.MasterEvent object at 0x7f57252a5290>> ignored
```

This looks vaguely like a regression of #19216, but the return error is different. 

After doing a quick git bisect, this error looks to have been introduced by a247dc0dcb511c73244ce3bb9ae47db3937091e1. If I revert that commit, the error goes away.

@s0undt3ch Would you mind taking a look?
