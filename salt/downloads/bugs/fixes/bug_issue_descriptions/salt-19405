Hello,

Getting a `KeyError` when trying to do a network bridging under Ubuntu 14.04 with latest release (`2014.7.0`)

This is my state file:

```
em1:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: eth
    - bridge: br0
    - proto: dhcp

br0:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: bridge
    - proto: dhcp
    - use:
      - network: em1
    - require:
      - network: em1
```

And the result:

```
          ID: em1
    Function: network.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
