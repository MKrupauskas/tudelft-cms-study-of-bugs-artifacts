I'm seeing this problem where a state fails when targeting multiple windows minions. The same state works just fine if I only target a single minion.

| Test | Command | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| regex work with other states | salt  'hostname[03].example.com' state.sls diamond.python | WORKS |
| regex fail with the diamond state | salt  'hostname[03].example.com' state.sls diamond | FAILS |
| globbing fails with the diamond state | salt  'hostname*' state.sls diamond | FAILS |
| Running the same state against a single host with regex works | salt  'hostname[0].example' state.sls diamond | WORKS |
| Running the same state against a single host works | salt  'hostname0.example' state.sls diamond | WORKS |
