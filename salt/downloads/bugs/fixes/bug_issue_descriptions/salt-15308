Sometimes it just doesn't feel like responding. It even happens with the master and minion on the same host. It seems to happen more often when calling `state.highstate` and could very well be the timeout. However retrieving some grains shouldn't be that time-consuming.

```
root@felwood# salt felwood grains.get groups
root@felwood# salt felwood grains.get groups
felwood:
    - test
    - test2
```

I don't know how to reproduce it reliable so I don't have any debug output I'm afraid.

There are several issues talking about connection issues etc but I'm not sure it's the exact same issue. Please close this one if you think it is.
