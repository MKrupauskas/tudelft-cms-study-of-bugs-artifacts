Greetings folks, just getting started on salt-cloud, installed last night and configured an account on aws with cert, and api key, however when trying to run a basic command I'm getting the above error message. 

Here is a copy of my terminal output, with command at the top:

```
root@ubuntu:/home/mark# salt-cloud -f avail_images my-ec2-config owner=self
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[ERROR   ] There was an error running the function: 'URLError' object has no attribute 'read'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 321, in run
    self.function_provider, self.function_name, kwargs
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1047, in do_function
    call='function', kwargs=kwargs
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py", line 579, in avail_images
    images = query(params)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py", line 265, in query
    root = ET.fromstring(exc.read())
AttributeError: 'URLError' object has no attribute 'read'
root@ubuntu:/home/mark# 
```

I'll give RackSpace a try and see if I get it in there too. 

Thanks for your help!
