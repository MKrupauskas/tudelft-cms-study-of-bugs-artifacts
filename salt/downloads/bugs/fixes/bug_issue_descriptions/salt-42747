### Description of Issue/Question

The highstate outputter mutates data on purpose (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/547ada9418442eaa9e87e380c411ac5e0d9a52e1/salt/output/highstate.py#L135-L141) which causes two problems:

1. If the outputter is invoked before the result is saved to the job cache then we lose part of the return.
2. If the outputter fails and falls back to another outputter we lose part of the return.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```py
# Add to the test runner:
def datatest():
    return {
        'data': 'dataishere',
        'notdata': 'otherthingsarehere',
        'outputter': 'highstate',  # remove this and 'data' _is_ written to the job cache
    }
```

1. Run `salt-run test.datatest`.
2. The highstate outputter is invoked because we told it to but fails and falls back to the nested outputter.
3. Observe the `data` key is now missing.

__and__

1. Run `salt-run test.datatest --async`.
2. Grab the JID.
3. Run `salt-run jobs.lookup_jid <jid>` and observe that `data` is missing.

### Versions Report

At least 2016.3 and onward through develop.
