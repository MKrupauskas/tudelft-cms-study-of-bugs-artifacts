### Description of Issue
I'm trying to set up a CA based on the example provided in https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.x509.html and also using https://backbeat.tech/blog/using-saltstack-for-internal-ssl-certificates/ as a reference.

AFAICT the documented mine.send for the ca.crt is not working. I find two issues: 
* The onchange does not trigger if the ca.crt already exists
* After removing the onchange, I get a `The following arguments are missing: m_name`

### Setup
The setup is basically the example provided in the documentation with no changes.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Follow the documentation.
