If the master's key in memory does not match the key on disk (because you changed it, and forgot to bounce salt) `salt-cloud` will fail:

```
[ERROR  ] Failed to deploy 'my-machine'. Error: Executing the command '/tmp/deploy.sh -c /tmp/' failed
Traceback (most recent call last):

my-machine:
    ----------
    Error:

```

If you run it without `-P`, you'll get:

```
 *  INFO: Running daemons_running()
 * ERROR: salt-minion was not found running
 * ERROR: Failed to run daemons_running()!!!
 * ERROR: salt-minion was not found running. Pass '-D' for additional debugging information...

```

`salt-cloud` doesn't accept `-D`, so the suggestion is not directly meaningful to the user. You need to SSH into the partially bootstrapped machine, and re-run the script with `-D`, just to finally get:

```
[CRITICAL] The Salt Master server's public key did not authenticate!
```

Given that `salt-cloud` pipes all sorts of boring debug and info output, this critical error ought to get piped through too.
