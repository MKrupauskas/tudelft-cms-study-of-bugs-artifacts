**Description**
There is at least one elementary situation in which _win.reg_ is not stateful.

**Setup**
Here is a state formula file called _test.sls_

```
salt registry key created:
   reg.present:
       - name: HKLM\SOFTWARE\SaltSalt
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

1. Run the following command on the minion
    ```
    salt-call state.apply test
    ```
2. Observe that the output will be something like
    ```
             ID: salt registry key created
    Function: reg.present
        Name: HKLM\SOFTWARE\SaltSalt
      Result: True
     Comment: Added HKLM\SOFTWARE\SaltSalt to HKLM\SOFTWARE\SaltSalt
     Started: 00:13:00.467830
    Duration: 157.917 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              reg:
                  ----------
                  Added:
                      ----------
                      Entry:
                          (Default)
                      Inheritance:
                          True
                      Key:
                          HKLM\SOFTWARE\SaltSalt
                      Owner:
                          None
                      Perms:
                          ----------
                          Deny:
                              None
                          Grant:
                              None
                      Value:
                          None

    ```
3. Rerun the command in step one and you will see the same output with the non-empty change dictionary..

**Expected behavior**
When the command is ran a second time, no operation should be performed and the change dictionary should be empty.
