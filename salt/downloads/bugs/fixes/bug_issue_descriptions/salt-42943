### Description of Issue/Question

The `extension_modules` option defaults to `/var/cache/minion/extmods` when it should default to `/var/cache/proxy/extmods`.
Additionally, this option should probably be appended to the `append_minionid_config_dirs` list of directories that should have the minion ID appended, hence each proxy minion caches its modules separately.
Without these, when running on a box managed by a regular minion with extension modules, creates overlaps.

### Setup

Any proxy type should be affected.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Startup a proxy minion and execute `test.get_opts`.
