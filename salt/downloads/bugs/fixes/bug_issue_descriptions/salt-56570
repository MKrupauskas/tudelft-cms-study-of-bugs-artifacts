### Description of Issue
PyMySQL raises InternalError Exception ins specific cases. The _connect method in the mysql module only checks for OperationalError. PyMySQL raising InternalError is clearly an upstream bug, and was already fixed with https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/pull/823. But as there has been no stable release of PyMySQL since 2018, this fix is not widely available. So it would be very handy if the mysql module could also check for InternalError with code > 1000 and handle it the same way.

### Setup

```
set root password for home:
  mysql_user:
    - present
    - name: root
    - host: 127.0.0.1
    - password: somepass
    - onlyif: mysql -e quit
    - connection_user: root
    - connection_pass: ''
```

Here the resulting Exception, not only version is affected, also other methods such as verify_login.

```
