I'm editing my SLS use vim and it created dot file. Then I ran states, I got below error:

```

    Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

I think this caused by `file.recurse` do `managed` dot file by default, after I quit my vim, the error disappeared.  I think `file.recurse` should have an option that allow include/ exclude hidden files.
