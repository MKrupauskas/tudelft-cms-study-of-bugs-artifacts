I'm running osx 10.8:

```

```

When running `state.highstate` from the master, I've started getting this:

```
2013-08-29 00:51:48,793 [salt.minion      ][WARNING ] The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "_unpacker.pyx", line 114, in msgpack._unpacker.unpackb (msgpack/_unpacker.cpp:114)

```

I have been developing a module and putting it in __modules_ in _file_root_.  This error started occurring after a basic update which doesn't create any syntax errors and has been testing fine outside of salt.  The extra frustrating part is that this isn't giving me any debug output even though I'm running the minion with --log-level=debug.

I, of course, assumed that my module was causing the issue, so I removed it and the reference to it from my environment.  I sync'd the changes with `saltutil.sync_all`, but I get the same error when I issue the `state.highstate` command.
