**Description**
First of all, I have been testing and using Saltstack for a couple of weeks now, and I think its perfect for many scenarios. Thanks for all you guys' effort.

I am trying to manage Linux LV sizes using the lvm.lv_present state in a state file. Here is the relevant part of the state file:

```
# ...

lv_data:
  lvm.lv_present:
    - name: data
    - vgname: elasticsearch
    - extents: 10

# ...
 ```

This state works well for creating the LV for the first time. However, it should also resize the LV if, for example, I change `extents: 10` to `extents: 20`. This feature was introduced in [#57659](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/57659). I am using version 3002.5 and checked under `salt/states/lvm.py`, if the relevant change is there, it is.

The issue is, I think, that for some reason `size_mb != old_size_mb or extents != old_extents` does not return `True`. I checked the reported extents value with `salt.modules.lvm.lvdisplay` (used for old_extents), and I am sure that it is not equal to the new value I set.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Create LV using the above state salt state.
```
# salt 'elastic-test-01' state.apply elastic.elasticsearch.test_lvm
elastic-test-01:
----------
          ID: lv_data
    Function: lvm.lv_present
        Name: data
      Result: True

                      Current Logical Extents Associated:
                          10

                      Logical Volume Size:
                          81920
                      Logical Volume Status:

                      Major Device Number:

                      Minor Device Number:

                      Open Logical Volumes:

                      Read Ahead Sectors:

                      Volume Group Name:
                          elasticsearch
                  Output from lvcreate:
                      WARNING: xfs signature detected on /dev/elasticsearch/data at offset 0. Wipe it? [y/n]: [n]
```
2. Update `extents`.
New state:
```
# salt 'elastic-test-01' state.show_sls elastic.elasticsearch.test_lvm --out=yaml
elastic-test-01:
  lv_data:
    __env__: base
    __sls__: elastic.elasticsearch.test_lvm
    lvm:
    - name: data
    - vgname: elasticsearch
    - extents: 20
    - lv_present
    - order: 10000
```
Meanwhile, the system reports the following:
```
# salt 'elastic-test-01' lvm.lvdisplay /dev/elasticsearch/data
elastic-test-01:
    ----------
    /dev/elasticsearch/data:
        ----------
        Allocated Logical Extents:
            -1
        Allocation Policy:
            0
        Current Logical Extents Associated:
            10
        Internal Logical Volume Number:
            -1
        Logical Volume Access:
            3
        Logical Volume Name:
            /dev/elasticsearch/data
        Logical Volume Size:
            81920
        Logical Volume Status:
            1
        Major Device Number:
            253
        Minor Device Number:
            2
        Open Logical Volumes:
            0
        Read Ahead Sectors:
            -1
        Volume Group Name:
            elasticsearch
```
Note that `Current Logical Extents Associated` is 10, while the new `extents` value is 20.

3. Re-run the state
```
# salt 'elastic-test-01' state.apply elastic.elasticsearch.test_lvm
elastic-test-01:
----------
          ID: lv_data
    Function: lvm.lv_present
        Name: data
      Result: True
     Comment: Logical Volume data already present

**Expected behavior**
LV gets resized.
