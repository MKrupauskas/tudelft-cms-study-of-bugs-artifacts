If package (for example www-servers/varnish) installed with accept_keywords "~amd64" (the latest unstable version installed in this case), then We change accept_keywords to "amd64" and run pkg.latest. In this case pkg.latest should install the latest stable version of package, but version of already installed package is greater than needed version to install and package couldn't install. I've tried to find a way to avoid this behavior - I think to add "allow_downgrade" parameter to pkg.latest. 
What do We think about it?
