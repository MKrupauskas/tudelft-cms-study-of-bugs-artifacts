I have an EC2 provider configured for salt cloud called 'my-ec2'. Doing a partial query, `salt-cloud -Q my-ec2`, works fine and returns information on all of my instances. A full query simply exits without doing anything, however. From the debug output it seems that it never loads the EC2 module.

``` bash
$ salt-cloud -F -l debug
