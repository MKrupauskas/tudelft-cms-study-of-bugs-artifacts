I tried to run a salt-minion on a CentOS6.9 32bit, with a master on the same OS in 64bit. The install process went without any issue (I followed the installation guide on https://repo.saltstack.com/index.html#rhel).

After changing the 'master' and 'id' fields of /etc/salt/minion, running the minion with "-l debug" gives:

Then output stops there and returns the prompt back. "ps aux | grep salt" displays the minion process though. On the master, salt-key shows the minion as accepted, but a test.ping always end with no response from the minion. After a while the minion is removed from the list of accepted keys.

The versions on the master and the minions are the same, 2016.11.4, and the only differences in dependencies were M2Crypto and pycrypto, which are not installed on the minion. But, installing them did not change anything. Also, I tested with a clean CentOS6.9 64bit, and new install of salt-minion, no M2Crypto nor pycrypto, and there were no problems, the minion ran and responded correctly.

After that, I thought about trying to setup another VM, this time with a Debian Jessie 32bit. Was about to follow https://repo.saltstack.com/index.html#debian until I saw that the url to import the SaltStack repository key was https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/latest/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub, which made me guess it would be problematic. Tried anyway, but the install ended with a dependency issue with python-tornado. Then a colleague suggested to try the install with pip, which, after a few bumps, finally gave a working salt-minion.

Following this result, I decided to setup a new VM, with again a CentOS6.9 32bit. Installed Python 2.7, Pip, then Salt via Pip. Same thing as the debian, had to install a few other things zlib, gcc-c++ mostly, but the Salt-Minion finally was working and responding correctly.

So, 2 things: 
- Is the installation via Pip on the 32-bit architecture viable and stable, or should I rather just setup everything on 64-bit systems ?
- If it is, how about including the installation procedure on the [corresponding page](https://repo.saltstack.com/index.html) ?

This issue is similar to [#27818](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/27818), [#27437](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/27437) and [#27228](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/27228), but I figured a final answer on using Salt with 32-bit systems could help.

Thank you.
