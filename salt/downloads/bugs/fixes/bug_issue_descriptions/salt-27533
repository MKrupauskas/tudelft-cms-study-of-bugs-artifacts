On the **develop** branch, when I run salt-ssh and the cache directory is empty, a traceback appears in the output. Everything still seems to work fine.

```
$ salt-ssh vagrant-dev test.ping
vagrant-dev:
    True
$ rm -rf .cache/
$ salt-ssh vagrant-dev test.ping
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named 'salt'
vagrant-dev:
    True
```
