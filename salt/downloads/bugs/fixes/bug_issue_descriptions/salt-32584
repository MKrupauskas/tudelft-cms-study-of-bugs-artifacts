### Description of Issue/Question

pkgrepo.managed ppa creates sources list with invalid filenames
### Setup

I had a salt state that resembled:

```
pkgrepo.managed:
  - ppa: avsm/ocaml42+opam12
```

It created a `.list` file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` named after the PPA, including the plus sign. However, plus signs aren't valid in names of apt data source files, which resulted in apt ignoring the file. From the man page:

> The /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory provides a way to add sources.list entries in separate files. The format is the same as for the regular sources.list file. File names need to end with .list and may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will print a notice that it has ignored a file

I was able to work around it by explicitly providing a file name in the state, but it would be nice if it worked by default.
