**Description**
FreeBSD packages can be specified by their name (`bash`) or by their origin (`shells/bash`).  The `pkg` tool understands both.  Salt's pkgng.latest_version function attempts to support origins (see 51fb2ac4c7a53240723c4922acac8fed9a130348) but fails.  For one thing, the `pkg` invocation may return many results since it searches for any string match in packages' names.  For another, Salt's `_get_version` function will filter out the correct result because `pkg` returns a list of packages, not a list of origins.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
$ sudo salt-call pkg.latest_version misc/cpuid
local:
```
Note that the pkg command executed is `pkg search -q -U misc/cpuid`.

**Expected behavior**
It should've returned `3.3_7`.  And the command executed should've been `pkg search -S origin -q -e -U misc/cpuid`
