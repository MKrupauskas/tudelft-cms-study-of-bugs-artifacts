### Description of Issue/Question
`ISSUE 1`
While running a state x509.certificate_managed on the current x509 of the branches 2019.2 (not the one from the .deb which already fail before that). I got the following error:

```----------
          ID: mongodb_generate_cert_mongodb
    Function: x509.certificate_managed
        Name: /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1933, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1939, in wrapper

```
The state is including a "managed_private_key" on the same file which is the use case at the origin of the previous error cause it will try to concatenate both certificates in a same file.

I was able to fix it by adding a .decode() on the following line:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/52014/commits/32ed6d438f51d741d74b81d0717c8c3b623fa977#diff-5499a295a50d60a761c34f4080e4014bR459

The certificate was then generated now.. but it's regenerated and replaced at each execution due to an other issue.

`ISSUE 2`
To decide if x509 is going to replace the local certificate or not, it will compare some elements of the certificate including the Issuer public key..  The local one, when read with the module will return a bytes type while the new generated one will be in str... Then the comparison fail and the certificate replaced...

I proposed the following fix:
