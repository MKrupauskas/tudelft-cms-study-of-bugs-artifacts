The osrelease (and therefore related grains) on FreeBSD currently assume that the userland version equals the kernel's version:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/f105f3927540e9c930033904b56e7dcd9d83de66/salt/grains/core.py#L1355

```
if grains['kernel'] in ('FreeBSD', 'OpenBSD', 'NetBSD'):
    grains.update(_bsd_cpudata(grains))
    grains['osrelease'] = grains['kernelrelease'].split('-')[0]
```

This is not always a safe assumption. Obviously, this is incorrect mid-upgrade, but it is also possible to run a full userland of a different version inside of a jail.

As of 10.0, FreeBSD provides the `freebsd-version` tool. `freebsd-version -u` will report the userland version, like `10.2-RELEASE-p3`. There is also a -k option to freebsd-version to ask about the kernel, but I don't think this is wise to use, because it's possible to install one of these full-userland jails without a kernel. The command with -k will fail in this situation. `uname` will report the correct kernel version from the host as usual.
