I was using some jinja templating in a state. It looks like this:

```
/etc/foobar.cfg:
  file.managed:
    contents: {{ (salt['pillar.get']('blah', 'unknown')) | yaml }}

/etc/foobaz.cfg:
  file.managed:
    contents: blah
```

The blah pillar was set to "test".

The rendered template looks like:

```
/etc/foobar.cfg:
  file.managed:
    contents: test
...
/etc/foobaz.cfg:
  file.managed:
    contents: blah
```

The ellipsis terminates yaml parsing, meaning that my /etc/foobaz.cfg file is not created. It seems that pyyaml serializes single strings like so:

```
>>> import yaml
>>> yaml.dump('test')
'test\n...\n'
```

This is probably not what salt should do when filtering a string to yaml. Unfortunately, pyyaml may not be able to remove the trailing char according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28376530/serialize-a-string-with-pyyaml-without-an-ellipsis. Perhaps salt should just remove the "\n...\n" at the end of dumped yaml string if it in fact ends with that string?
