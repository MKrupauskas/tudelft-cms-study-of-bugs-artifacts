### Description of Issue/Question

I'm running on Ubuntu 16.04 with salt-minion-2016.3.2. I have install-recommends disabled by default, and instead want to rely on explicitly enabling it in a few cases. However in modules/aptpkg.py I see that only "--no-install-recommends" is being passed to apt when "install_recommends" is set to False. If set to true then "--install-recommends" should be passed, which overrides the global setting.

For example:
- with --install-recommends kubuntu-desktop will install amarok
- with --no-install-recommends kubuntu-desktop will not 
### Setup

Create a file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01-no-install-recommends.conf with the following

```
APT::Install-Recommends "0";
APT::Install-Suggests "0";
```

A rule like the following will not actually install the recommended packages:

```
kubuntu-desktop:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: kubuntu-desktop
    - install_recommends: True
```
