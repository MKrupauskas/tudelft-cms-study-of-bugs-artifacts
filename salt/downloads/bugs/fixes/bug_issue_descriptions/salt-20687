I just upgraded to 2014.7.2, and I'm running into an issue where most of my previously working file.managed states are now broken. I haven't fully determined a root cause yet, but I did figure out that templated files work ok.

This works:

```
/tmp/foobar:
    file.managed:
        - source: salt://foobar
        - user: root
        - group: root
        - mode: 644
        - template: jinja
```

```
# salt casework-eval state.sls test
casework-eval:
  Name: /tmp/foobar - Function: file.managed - Result: Clean
```

This fails:

```
/tmp/foobar:
    file.managed:
        - source: salt://foobar
        - user: root
        - group: root
        - mode: 644
       # - template: jinja
```

```
casework-eval:
----------
          ID: /tmp/foobar
    Function: file.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: Source file salt://foobar not found

Minion logs aren't very helpful:

```

I'm running with both a 2014.7.2 master and minion on SmartOS. Can't say for sure if this worked on 2014.7.1 because I upgraded directly from 2014.1.0.
