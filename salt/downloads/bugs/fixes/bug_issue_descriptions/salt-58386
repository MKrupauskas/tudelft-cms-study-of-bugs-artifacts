Using user defined pillars leads to an exception if tageting any other vm than dom0 in qubes.

To Reproduce
My pillars are located in
/srv/salt/user_pillar/

To enable them during a qubesctl execution, I'm running:
sudo qubesctl --show-output state.highstate --pillar-root=/srv/salt/user_pillar/

This works quite well when running this for dom0, but when I'm running it towards a target:
sudo qubesctl --show-output --target myTarget state.highstate --pillar-root=/srv/salt/user_pillar/

I receive this error after the disp-mgmt-vm starts:
ERROR (exception list index out of range)

Expected behavior
Pillars are applied same way like it's done for dom0 with:
sudo qubesctl --show-output state.highstate --pillar-root=/srv/salt/user_pillar/

Actual behavior
I receive this error after the disp-mgmt-vm starts:
ERROR (exception list index out of range)

Solutions you've tried

    Instead of using user defined pillars, it's possible to use jinja variables which does work.
    Passing pillars as command line params also doesn't work:
    sudo qubesctl --show-output --target myVM state.apply pillar=true pillar='{"myPillar":"value"}'
    this leads to this error:
    myVM:
    TypeError encountered executing state.apply: apply_() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 7 were given
    Also the following fails:
    sudo qubesctl top.enable user_salt.myPersonalTopFile pillar=true

With the stack trace:
SaltRenderError: Could not find relpath for user_salt.myPersonalTopFile.top
