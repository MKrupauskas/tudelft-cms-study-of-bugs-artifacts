### Description of Issue/Question

```$ salt host1 file.replace /tmp/test.yaml pattern='- test' repl='- ct'```
resulted lots of really funny (but pretty much broken) lines like:
```  clu['ct']['ct']['ct']r: myclu['ct']['ct']['ct']r```

Seems it's not always a regex...
May have been fixed in the new versions, but maybe not and you'd like to see that.
