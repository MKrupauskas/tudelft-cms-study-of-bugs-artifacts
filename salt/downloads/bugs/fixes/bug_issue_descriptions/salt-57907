**Description**
On macOS if you have a service.dead state that is looking for a missing service. Salt will look twice for that missing service. This behavior was introduced in a change to fix a different issue #48414, the method salt uses to find all available services is pretty extensive which causes a delay every time it has to double-check a service should be missing. We should not double check if a service is present if we are checking from a service.dead state.

I'll be attaching a PR to fix shortly.
