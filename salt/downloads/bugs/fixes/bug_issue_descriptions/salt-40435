removing seems to work, but there are files left in dir.
```
spm remove apache
Removing packages:
	apache
Proceed? [N/y] y
... removing apache
```

trying to install again and I see this:
```
spm install apache
Installing packages:
	apache

Proceed? [N/y] y
... installing apache
[ERROR   ] /srv/spm/salt/apache already exists, not installing
Not installing apache due to existing files:

```

for man spm I see this:
```
man spm
No manual entry for spm
See 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.
