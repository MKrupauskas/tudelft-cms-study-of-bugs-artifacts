I don't see how this would ever work.  The module boto_cloudwatch.py is expecting a comma separated string called "insufficient_data_actions", but this string is never passed to the module by the state module.

state.sls

```
salt-minion-alarm:
  boto_cloudwatch_alarm.present:
    - name: salt-minion process stopped
    - require:
      - pip: install-boto
    - attributes:
        metric: Thread Count
        namespace: System/Windows
        statistic: Sum
        comparison: "<="
        threshold: 0
        period: 10
        evaluation_periods: 1
        description: The salt-minion process is not running
        alarm_actions:
          - arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:101010101010:all-events
```
