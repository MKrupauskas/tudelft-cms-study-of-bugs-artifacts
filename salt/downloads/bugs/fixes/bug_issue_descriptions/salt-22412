I needed to pre-configure APT repository that is always trusted. According to [the manual](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/ja/man5/sources.list.5.html), this is done by specifying `trusted=yes` option after `deb` in the name. It is valid statement and it works perfectly with APT. Problem is, that salt creates this repository on every run.

Example state:

```
"my repo":
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: "deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.example.net/ binary/"
```
## Bug description

```
staging:/srv/salt# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
staging:/srv/salt#

staging:/srv/salt# salt-call --local state.sls example.sls
[...]

deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.example.net binary/staging:/srv/salt#

```

Notice missing `\n` on the end. It's not the biggest problem, but if you run the state again, this is what you get:

```
staging:/srv/salt# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy main
deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.example.net binary/

deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.example.net binary/deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.example.net binary/staging:/srv/salt#
```

This obviously results in non-working repo. Is there any other way to specify APT repository options to avoid this bug?
