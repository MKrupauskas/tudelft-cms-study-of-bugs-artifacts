As can be seen in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/HEAD/salt/cloud/clouds/lxc.py#L413 the `salt/cloud/.../creating` event is fired when the creation of a LXC container is started, but the related `created` event is not.

This renders triggering actions after the container creation impossible if we rely on the event system.
