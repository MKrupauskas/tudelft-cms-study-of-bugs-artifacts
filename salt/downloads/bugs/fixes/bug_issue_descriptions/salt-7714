To reproduce on a Windows minion:
1. Run a `state.highstate` or `state.sls` using `test=True`.
2. Run the same command without `test=True`.

Now, all further `state.highstate` and `state.sls` commands will be operating under `test=True` because `__opts__['test']` is `True`, until the minion is restarted.
