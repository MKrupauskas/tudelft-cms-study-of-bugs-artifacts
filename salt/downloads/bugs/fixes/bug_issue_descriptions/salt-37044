### Description of Issue/Question

The pkg state and module won't work on latest Arch Linux. This might be related to an Arch upgrade, since it was working before in current version.
### Setup

Latest Arch Linux x64, running salt-zmq 2016.3.3
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt-call pkg.version bash
'pkg.version' is not available.

and

     Comment: State 'pkg.uptodate' was not found in SLS 'maintenance.linux.arch'
              Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False
```

The module is loaded and the docs confirm this.

```
salt-call sys.doc pkg 
```
