Trying to stream events to the browser and `rest_cherrypy` looks very promising. I can connect using a Python WebSockets client (as in the docs), but I'm blocked on Chrome's behaviour as regards "masking". I don't know the protocol well, but some Googling seems to point in the direction of the default ws4py stream setting of `always_mask=False` getting overridden somewhere (perhaps by an unrelated CherryPy thing) and causing "masked frames" to get sent to the client (my browser) which means I see the following message:
`WebSocket connection to 'ws://.../ws/...' failed: A server must not mask any frames that it sends to the client.`

Perusing the code, I can't see anywhere `always_mask` is overridden; the Salt subclass of `ws4py.websockets.Websocket` doesn't appear to touch the default for `self.stream` which is where the option would be passed.

I appreciate this is a bit of a chore to reproduce, so I'm going to have a bash with the `rest_tornado` server in the mean time `:)`
