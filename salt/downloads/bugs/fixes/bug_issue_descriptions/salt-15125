Though reload_modules will reload the grain modules, it doesn't reload grains. So, if I update my hostname in a state, then wish to use the fqdn grain later in the same state run, it'll have the incorrect FQDN. Additionally, if I install a python module necessary for a grain module, grains for that run will also not be loaded.
