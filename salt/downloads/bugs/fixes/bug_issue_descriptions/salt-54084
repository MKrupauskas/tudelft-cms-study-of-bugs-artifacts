Since upgrading to 2019.2 and to py3 the mount persistance updates fstab on every state.apply. This is because the mount options are in no order and get randomly inserted into fstab.

Ex:
```
# grep cache /etc/fstab 
tmpfs		/home/cache	tmpfs	size=4G,mode=1777,defaults,nofail	0 0

salt-call state.apply
...
          ID: freitext-name mount
    Function: mount.mounted
        Name: /home/cache
      Result: True
     Comment: Target was already mounted. Updated the entry in the fstab.

```
