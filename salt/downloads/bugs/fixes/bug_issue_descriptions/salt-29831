I'm using `salt-master` as an unprivileged user `salt`. The salt-minion is running as `root`, or any user beside `salt`.

When the `/etc/salt/minion.d` is readable for anyone, but files in it are not readable by user `salt`, the salt-master fails to start with access denied errors:

```
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/salt/minion.d/00_master.conf'
```

The `salt-master` should ignore the `minion.d` directory, imo.

A workaround is to deny access to that directory to everyone beside the owner, so that the `salt-master` user can't see these files it can't read.
