When creating users on multiple Linux distributions, I'm seeing different behavior between major CentOS releases.  I would like to create users with specific uid's and have their gid's be the same number.  In reading issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/14133, I see this may not be the intended use of the option.  Either way, is there a reason why Centos 5 would give me the expected behavior, but Centos 6 and Ubuntu 14.04 would not?

```
testuser1:
  user.present:
    - fullname: Test User 1
    - shell: /bin/bash
    - home: /home/testuser1
    - group: present
    - uid: 111111
    - gid_from_name: True
    - groups:
      {% if grains['os_family'] == 'RedHat' %}
      - wheel
      {% elif grains['os_family'] == 'Debian' %}
      - sudo
      {% endif %}
    - remove_groups: False
    - expire: -1
```

A highstate run is successful

```
[root@salt-master users]# salt \* cmd.run 'grep testuser /etc/{passwd,group,group-}'
centos5-minion-1:
    /etc/passwd:testuser1:x:111111:111111:Test User 1,,,:/home/testuser1:/bin/bash
    /etc/group:wheel:x:10:root,testuser1
    /etc/group:testuser1:x:111111:
    /etc/group-:testuser1:x:111111:
salt-minion-1:
    /etc/passwd:testuser1:x:111111:500:Test User 1,,,:/home/testuser1:/bin/bash
    /etc/group:wheel:x:10:testuser1
    /etc/group:testuser1:x:500:
    /etc/group-:testuser1:x:500:
ubuntu1404:
    /etc/passwd:testuser1:x:111111:1080:Test User 1,,,:/home/testuser1:/bin/bash
    /etc/group:sudo:x:27:install,testuser1
    /etc/group:testuser1:x:1080:
    /etc/group-:testuser1:x:1080:
```

"salt-minion1" is CentOS 6.5.
"centos5-minion-1" is CentOS 5.11
you might be able to guess what "ubuntu1404" is :)

Is this expected behavior?
