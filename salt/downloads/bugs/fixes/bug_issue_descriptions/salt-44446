### Description of Issue/Question

an uncaught recursion happens when prereq is setup without a module defined, this looks to not be related to #8210

### Setup
simple test case
```
item1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: cat /tmp/content
    - unless: test -e /tmp/content

item2:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/content
    - contents: 'hi'
    - prereq:
      - item1
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I would expect an error but not a recursion error. 
`salt-call --local state.apply recursion_error test=True -l debug 2>&1 | less`
```

```

if you change the state to 

```
item1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: cat /tmp/content
    - unless: test -e /tmp/content

item2:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/content
    - contents: 'hi'
    - prereq:
      - cmd: item1
```
and run again. you get expected normal results.
