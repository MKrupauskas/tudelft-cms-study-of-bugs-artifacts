### Description of Issue/Question

``rvm.installed`` is meant to install a specific version of ruby, installing RVM along the way if it is not present on the system.

RVM supports wildcard ruby versions.  ``ruby-2.4`` will install the latest bug fix release i.e. ``ruby-2.4.1``, ``ruby-2`` will install the latest bugfix release of the latest minor release, ``ruby`` will install the latest ruby release.

When ``rvm.installed`` runs it calls ``rvm list`` to list installed rubies.  Unfortunately it doesn't implement the correct matching logic, so doesn't detect that the specified ruby version is installed (even if it is). The state then calls ``rvm install <ruby>`` at which point RVM complains that version of ruby is already installed.

The state emits the error ``Could not install ruby`` which is entirely unhelpful.  The debug log tells the whole story however:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state rvm.installed for [ruby]
[INFO    ] Executing command ['/usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm', 'list'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: 
rvm rubies

   ruby-2.4.1 [ x86_64 ]

# Default ruby not set. Try 'rvm alias create default <ruby>'.

# => - current
# =* - current && default
#  * - default
[INFO    ] Executing command ['/usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm', 'install', 'ruby'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stderr: Already installed ruby-2.4.1.
To reinstall use:

    rvm reinstall ruby-2.4.1
[ERROR   ] Could not install ruby.
[INFO    ] Completed state [ruby] at time 05:19:57.103816 duration_in_ms=2780.75
[INFO    ] Running state [redis_cluster_utils_install] at time 05:19:57.105852
```

It seems like the only way to really fix this is to attempt an ``rvm install`` and catch the ``already installed`` error, as there doesn't appear to be a way to resolve a wildcard ruby to an actual ruby version.

### Setup
```
install_latest_rvm_ruby:
  rvm.installed:
    - name: ruby
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the above state twice.  You may need to import the signing keys for installation to succeed.

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```
