This patch (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/6734) seems to break the id grain on debian systems (and maybe many others)!

We just got an update from 0.16.4 to 0.17.0 through unattended upgrades (maybe a bad idea for salt).
Now all our minions are gone, because the id changed and new minion keys are generated, which of course are unknown to the master.
These ids do not include the domain part anymore.
This is really bad. It's not the first time the id generation changes and breaks everything. With such a crucial part of the system, i think there should be taken more care.

Sorry for the angry tone, but this is a bit frustrating.
