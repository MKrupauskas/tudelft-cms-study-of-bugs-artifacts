This scenario was tested on SaltStack 2014.7.5. Let's have a custom execution module called `mymod`:

```
# Import salt libs
import salt
import salt.loader
import socket

# Import python libs
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def __virtual__():
    return True

def masters():
    host = 'salt-master-' + str(__salt__['network.ipaddrs']()[0].split(',')[1])

    try:
        (hostname, aliases, addresses) = socket.gethostbyname_ex(host)
        return addresses
    except socket.error:
        return 'Unabled to resolve {0}'.format(host)
```

Let's assume the module `mymod` is available on minions (installed during bootstrap process or synced from related environment and `_modules` sub-directory from masters). When I call it from a minion I get a list of masters IP addresses:

```
salt-call mymod.masters
local:
  - 1.2.3.4
  - 1.2.3.5
```

Let's have a minion configured so it gets masters IPs from the module:

```
master_type: func
master: mymod.masters
```

When I start such minion it exits with this error (when I disable exception handler on the line https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/minion.py#L695 otherwise I get error `Failed to evaluate master address from module ...` from it):

```

    host = 'salt-master-vpc' + str(__salt__['network.ipaddrs']()[0].split('.')[1])

```

Does it mean that some Salt internal structures are initialized after the minion connects to masters? Or did I misunderstand anything else?
