Problem: "Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: sshfs#backup:, current: backup:, /backup:"
Environment: protocol specified via hash (sshfs or ftpfs)

Steps to reproduce:
- in sls state specify:

```
/mnt/backup:
  mount:
    - mounted
    - device: 'sshfs#backup:'
    - fstype: fuse
    - opts: defaults,reconnect,nobootwait
    - require:
      - pkg: sshfs
```
- apply state to host
  - fstab line corretly created
    (sshfs#backup:      /mnt/backup fuse    defaults,reconnect,nobootwait   0 0)
  - fs mounted
- apply state to host in second time: 
  - salt will force unmount due to "devices don't match" 
  - and mount it back
- apply state with test=True: salt will force unmount

I am using salt version 2014.1 but in current release candidate it seems to be the same problem.
