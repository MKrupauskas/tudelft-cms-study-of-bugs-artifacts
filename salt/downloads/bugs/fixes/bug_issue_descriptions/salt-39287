### Description of Issue/Question
I have a start.sh script which looks like
```
    setsid screen -AmdS "myapp" bash start2.sh &> /dev/null
```

The newly  spawned process shows no relation to salt-minion
(process group, parent PID etc.)

The problem is that  the background process gets a SIGTERM when salt-minion is restarted and dies.

This is seriously annoying.
There are no zombie processes created by salt.

```
  PID  PPID  PGID   SID COMMAND
26911     1 26911 26911 screen
26912 26911 26912 26912 java
(java is the app process)
```


### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
The start.sh script is invoked via cmd.run
(it's important for it to be run via master to trigger the issue, no problems when using salt-call)

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
