I want to use redis to fix a couple of issues I've had with getting jobs listed and reported etc. quickly via the netapi.  So I naturally ran across the bug with some returners returning a list, and others returning a dict.  I tried the fix at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/28654 by changing the `__virtual__` to redis_fix, and updating my config.  For one highstate job, the fix seems to work, but once I ran a `salt '* ' state.highstate` the listing crashed.  

I posted details at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/28654/files#r48502272
