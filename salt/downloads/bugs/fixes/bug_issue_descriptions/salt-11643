If I run `state.highstate test=true` I get this showing up in the output

```
----------
          ID: supervise-opg-lpa-front
    Function: supervisord.running
        Name: opg-lpa-front
      Result: None

but if I run this

```
root@front-01:~# supervisorctl status opg-lpa-front
opg-lpa-front                    RUNNING    pid 31745, uptime 0:48:42
```

it shows that it is running already.

https://github.com/terminalmage/salt/blob/6ab77e5317803f0b14112a3de470883827f0c530/salt/modules/supervisord.py might be the cause of the problem - it seems to always just return 'I need to be started'.

I attempted a fix for this but I'm not sure what to return in test mode to say 'yes this is in the right state' - pointers gladly appreciated on where to look to fix this.
