### Description of Issue/Question
 _get_driver() method of libcloud_dns module incorrectly initialize the driver class.
in: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/libcloud_dns.py#L70 the method use the provider name to search libcloud DRIVERS dict and find the suitable class
for "godaddy" the driver class is "GoDaddyDNSDriver" that has the following constructor:
https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/v1.5.0/libcloud/dns/drivers/godaddy.py#L121

as you can see the constructor first parameter is "shopper_id" and not "key" as _get_driver() pass here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/libcloud_dns.py#L76

The same problem also applied to other DNS drivers ( GoogleDNSDriver for example ).
I also checked older versions of libcloud to see if libcloud changed their function signatures and broke this module but it seems their signature for godaddy DNS Provider didn't change:
https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/0.20.1/libcloud/dns/drivers/godaddy.py#L120

It seems that this module never really worked, am I missing here something?
