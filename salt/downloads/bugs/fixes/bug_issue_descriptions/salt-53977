### Description of Issue
The first time this state is executed an error level output is logged on the minion. I believe this is because an attempt is made to grep the file without first checking that the file exists.

### Setup
```
htpasswd_file:
  webutil.user_exists:
    - name: <user>
    - password: <password>
    - htpasswd_file: /etc/nginx/.htpasswd
    - force: true
    - require:
      - pkg: apache2-utils
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
[ERROR   ] Command '['grep', '<user>', '/etc/nginx/.htpasswd']' failed with return code: 2
[ERROR   ] stderr: grep: /etc/nginx/.htpasswd: No such file or directory
[ERROR   ] retcode: 2
```
