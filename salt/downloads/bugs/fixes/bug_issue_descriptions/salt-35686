### Description of Issue

When using a windows based minion and following the tutorial for minionfs (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/minionfs.html)
cp.push works fine and uploads files to (by default) /var/cache/salt/master/minions/<minion-id>/files/
File gets created under a path mirroring the source i.e c:/temp/file.txt
When using cp.get_file trying to use salt://<minion-id>/c:/temp/file.txt fails to find any file to get.

Attempting to escape the colon with \ also fails (i.e salt://minion/c:/temp/file.txt)
Removing the colon from the c: folder by renaming the folder then allows the fs call (i.e salt://minion/c/temp/file.txt) so minionfs is working fine.
### Setup

A windows minion and saltmaster
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

create file c:\temp\test.txt on windows minion
on master:
salt 'minion' cp.push c:\temp\test.txt
salt 'minion' cp.getfile salt://minion/c:/temp/test.txt c:\temp\test2.txt
