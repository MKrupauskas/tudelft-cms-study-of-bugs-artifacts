**Description**
Performing `cp.list_states`, `cp.list_master`, or similar function calls between multiple dynamic environments often results in incorrect file listings depending on cache settings. The [code responsible for returning file lists](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/fileserver/roots.py#L327-L332) caches the listing by environment. In a dynamic configuration, the environment used for the cache file is the literal `__env__` string. This results in the cache for a previously run environment being returned for other envs within the cache retention period.

**Setup**
Master configuration:

```yaml
file_roots:
  __env__:
    - /srv/salt/__env__
```

Create filesystem contents on master:

```bash
for env in base foo bar
do
    mkdir -p /srv/salt/$env
    touch /srv/salt/$env/${env}.sls
done
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Running `cp.list_master` for each env:

```bash
for env in base foo bar
do
    salt-call cp.list_master saltenv=$env
done
```

Results in just the contents of the first env being shown:

```
# base
local:
    - base.sls

# foo
local:
    - base.sls

# bar
local:
    - base.sls
```

**Expected behavior**

The `cp.list_master` loop above should result in the contents of each filesystem being shown for each call:

```
# base
local:
    - base.sls

# foo
local:
    - foo.sls

# bar
local:
    - bar.sls
```
