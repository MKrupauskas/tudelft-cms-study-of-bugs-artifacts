We are new to salt. We are trying to install latest package with following cicli.sls file:

```
cicli:
   pkg.latest:
    - pkgs:
      - cicli
```

It only installs the latest when there was no cicli package already installed. Otherwise it says following without doing anything:

```
# salt 10.70.x.x state.sls cicli
[WARNING ] The `dmidecode` binary is not available on the system. GPU grains will not be available.
10.70.x.x:
----------
          ID: cicli
    Function: pkg.latest
      Result: True
     Comment: Package cicli is already up-to-date.

```

Can anyone shed some lights on what we are doing wrong?
