Currently, if I `salt-ssh '*' state.apply` and one of the servers are down, I get over 200 lines of output, including the entire master options dict.

I suggest something like this instead:

```
this-machine-is-down:
Error:  Failed to return clean data
Output: ssh: connect to host x.x.x.x port 22: No route to host

this-machine-is-up:

Summary for this-machine-is-up
