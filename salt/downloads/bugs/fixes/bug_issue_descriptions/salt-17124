**Original ticket content:**

Hello,

On our production saltmaster we've notice that there are now 500684 files in our cache/publish_auth directory. As far as we can make out, salt attempts to stat every one of those files when we make a simple salt grain lookup on some of our nodes (we ran it through strace), such as:

salt -G 'role:aempublisher' grains.item role aem_group_id aemready

Is this another known issue? There was something very similar with files in the cache/jobs directory filling up, which again I believe has been fixed in 2014.7 (but we've not upgraded to that release yet as it's not fully supported).

For now, is it safe to delete those files (or, say, all files older than 24 hours)?

Regards,
James
