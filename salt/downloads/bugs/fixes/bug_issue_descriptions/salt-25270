`curl -s -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com | sudo sh -s -- -U -P -p python-jinja2 -A master git v2015.8.0rc1`

results in the following output:

```
 *  INFO: Running daemons_running()
 * DEBUG: Waiting 3 seconds for processes to settle before checking for them
 * ERROR: salt-minion was not found running
 * ERROR: Failed to run daemons_running()!!!
```

Which makes sense because the init script is missing.

```
bjackson@dev-kmr01:~$ ls /etc/init.d/salt*
ls: cannot access /etc/init.d/salt*: No such file or directory
```

Not entirely sure if the error is in salt-bootstrap or salt (or some other place).

```
