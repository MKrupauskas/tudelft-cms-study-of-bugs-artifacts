### Description of Issue/Question
Salt eauth tokens are stored in msgpack format on disk with world readable permissions. Considering that each token file has both the token respective username, anyone who can read these files can masquerade as any user with that has been issued an eauth token.

If the `token_dir` directory exists when starting a master, the permissions are not tightened. If the directory does not already exist, it is created using the default `umask` (which as most know is `022` by default on most platforms) allowing any thing that can get access to the master filesystem the ability to read auth tokens. 

### Setup
This happens with the standard configuration.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1) Start a salt-master with the standard configuration and an eauth backend enabled.
2) Issue a request to retrieve an auth token.
3) Verify that an unprivileged user can read them.
