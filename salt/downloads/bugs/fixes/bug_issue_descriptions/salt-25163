Hello,

I have some backslash (`\`) within some structures. When trying to generate configuration with those data, I end up finding the backslashes are doubled.

After checking, there seems to be some doubling occuring while passing a dict in jinja templates defaults...

Here is a "small" example to show how variable tends to convert dict values...

State file:

``` text
# poc.sls
{% set foo = 'direct\\quoted' %}
{% set bar = {'baz': 'dict\\quoted', } %}

/tmp/poc.txt:
  file.managed:
  - template: jinja
  - source: salt://poc.txt
  - defaults:
      foo: {{ foo }}
      bar: {{ bar }}
      barbaz: {{ bar['baz'] }}
      sub:
        foo: {{ foo }}
```

Template file:

``` text
# poc.txt
foo: {{ foo }}

bar: {{ bar }}
bar.baz {{ bar['baz'] }}

barbaz: {{ barbaz }}

sub: {{ sub }}
sub.foo {{ sub['foo'] }}
```

Lets deploy...

``` bash
salt $(hostname) state.sls poc
```

And here is the result file, with added comments:

``` text
# /tmp/poc.txt 
## foo has simple backslash - works fine
foo: direct\quoted

## The passed 'baz' dict seems to have double backslashes?!
bar: {'baz': 'dict\\\\quoted'}
bar.baz dict\\quoted

## Well, if we pass directly, it appears the original value is correct though
barbaz: dict\quoted

# When passing a dict, but not converting from a dict, it works fine
sub: {'foo': 'direct\\quoted'}
sub.foo direct\quoted
```

Note: currently running Helium.

If that behaviour is fixed/changed in latest, just state so, but I haven't seen anything in changelogs.
