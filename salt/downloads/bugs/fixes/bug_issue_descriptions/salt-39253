### Description of Issue/Question
salt-minion will not run if dotnet 3.5 is not installed.  The exact issue comes form SideBySide and reported in the event log.
_Activation context generation failed for "c:\salt\bin\python.exe". Dependent Assembly Microsoft.VC90.CRT,processorArchitecture="amd64",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",type="win32",version="9.0.21022.8" could not be found. Please use sxstrace.exe for detailed diagnosis._

If a check is performed for this during the install, dotnet 3.5 feature could be enabled on the server before install continues, or perhaps the dependency can be alleviated some other way.

### Setup
Windows Server 2008r2, dotnet 3.5 feature not installed (on Azure it is not installed by default, this is where I found this problem).  Dotnet 4.5.2 is part of azure machines base build, and the dependency is not met.

No issue with minion on 2012r2 server from azure, with base feature of 4.5 enabled and updated to 4.6.1.  Again this is a base build from MS.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Windows 2008r2 server with dotnet 3.5 not installed.  Have not yet tested at this time if a removal of said feature will work the same.  Install of minion succeeds with no problems, but cannot run.
