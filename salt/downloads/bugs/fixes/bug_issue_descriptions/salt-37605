### Description of Issue/Question
If you have domain and search options added to your /etc/resolv.conf file I see this warning in the log files every time a command is run against that minion:

`[WARNING ] /etc/resolv.conf: The domain and search keywords are mutually exclusive.`

### Setup
Minion with both domain and search options set in /etc/resolv.conf


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt-call --local sys.doc none`
and you will see the warning:

` [WARNING ] /etc/resolv.conf: The domain and search keywords are mutually exclusive.`

Looks like this was added with: #33934  which looks like it is on purpose but many machines I build in the cloud include both the domain and search options by default
