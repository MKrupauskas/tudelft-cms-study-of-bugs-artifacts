### Description of Issue/Question
I estimate that versions of python-novaclient above 6.0.1 are incompatible with the nova cloud module. This is likely due to the overall push by the Openstack team to separate the neutron and nova client functions and the overall attempts to move everything up into the main openstack client. 

My guess is the best option will be to rewrite the Nova module to either use the new openstack client as much as possible and/or investigate what functions in the nova cloud are missing/broken in newer versions of nova client. I recall that @gtmanfred mentioned he was considering rewriting the module in upcoming versions

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
At this time I know that installing Nova 8.0+ breaks the nova cloud module.
