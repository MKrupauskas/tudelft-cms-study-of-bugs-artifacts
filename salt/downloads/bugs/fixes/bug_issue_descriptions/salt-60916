**Description**
After running pkgrm to remove an installation of Salt, and then using pkgadd to install a new version of Salt, wrong linkage is created

```
The issue with the linkage
/opt/saltstack/salt/run/run -> /opt/saltstack/salt/run
```
Work-around has been to utilize zones, or a clean install on a system.

Need to investigate why pkgadd/pkgrm is not cleaning or installing correctly and if there is some post-install action that can be taken to rectify the issue.

**Setup**
pkgrm salt and pkgadd  new install of Salt

Recommend using the Intel Solaris 10 as quicker than the Sparc version

Correct stat for the file
```
root@unknown:/# l /opt/saltstack/salt/run/run
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root     16311338 Aug 27 15:48 /opt/saltstack/salt/run/run
root@unknown:/# 
```

Please be as specific as possible and give set-up details.

- [ ] on-prem machine
- [ ] VM (Virtualbox, KVM, etc. please specify)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD

  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
see above

**Expected behavior**
/opt/saltstack/salt/run/run is an executable file and not a symbolic link.
