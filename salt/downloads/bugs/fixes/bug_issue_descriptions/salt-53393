### Description of Issue
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/53327
Default user for 'postgresql' is outdated on FreeBSD.
KeyError: "getpwnam(): name not found: 'pgsql'"

That user was updated from 'pgsql' to 'postgresql' in 2016:

AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql96-server
AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

The default unix user used by the PostgreSQL daemon has changed to
postgres' to reflect the long time upstream's convention. Any scripts you have using the old pgsql' unix user should be modified when upgrading to
PostgreSQL version 9.6. Older versions of PostgreSQL will continue using
`pgsql' until their end-of-life.

### Setup
