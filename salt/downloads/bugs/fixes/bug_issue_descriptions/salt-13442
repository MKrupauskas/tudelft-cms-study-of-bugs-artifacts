I'm facing some recurrent connection issues between my minion and master:
when salt-master and salt-minion daemons start, everything is fine, I can test.ping my minion from the master, but after 5 or 10 minutes, test.ping or any other module function doesn't work anymore.

I can see from the log (log level set to debug) that master correctly send the job to the minion, but on the minion side: nothing, it doesn't receive the test.ping request.

Note that the minions are connected to the master through a 3g connection, which is slow, so it may be partly responsible for this connection issue (may be a timeout issue), but a ssh connection running at the same time is very rarely closed because of the slow 3g connection.
So ssh may be more fault tolerant than salt-minion for small temporary loss of connection?

I've noticed that when I issue a test.ping from the master, `netstat` tells me immediately that there is a new TIME_WAIT connection on 127.0.0.1:4506:

```
root@salt-master:/var/log/salt# netstat -anp |grep 450
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4505            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7387/python
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:4506            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      7379/python
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:57536         127.0.0.1:4506          TIME_WAIT   -
tcp        0    358 172.17.0.2:4505         80.215.138.72:30165     ESTABLISHED 7387/python
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:57535         127.0.0.1:4506          TIME_WAIT   -
```

Note that every now and then, I can test.ping the minion again, but 5-10min later (sometimes more than 60min later), it becomes offline again (for salt only, not ssh).

I think that the problem is observed since I've updated salt to version 2014.1.1 on both minion and master sides.

For information, both master and minions runs on Debian Wheezy.
And here is salt-master and salt-minion versions reports:
