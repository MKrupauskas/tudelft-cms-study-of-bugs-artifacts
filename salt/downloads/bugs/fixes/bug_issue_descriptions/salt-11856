So I have this state:
<code>
InitialImport:
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.6/bin/mysql.exe --host=127.0.0.1 --user=admin --password "{{pillar['mysql_password']}}" --port=3306 --default-character-set=utf8 --comments < 'C:/salt/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/mysql/Dump20140407.sql'
</code>

Which is giving me this:
<code>
    Data failed to compile:

I've found if I use the cwd parameter and don't use the full path after -name, then it works fine. It seems to break if after -name you use the full path.
