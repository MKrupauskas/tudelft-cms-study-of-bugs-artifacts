**Description**
Both `grains.get()` and `pillar.get()` fail to return values in nested dictionaries, whereas `salt.grains.get()` and `salt.pillar.get()` both do.

Sorry if this is a duplicate or a known feature, I couldn't find anything in the issues, and couldn't find anything in the docs that suggests that this would be expected behavior.

**Setup**
Given this state file:
```
/tmp/test.txt:
    file.managed:
        - contents: |
            --- salt tests ---
            salt.grains.get: {{ salt.grains.get('meta-data:ami-id') }}
            grains.get: {{ grains.get('meta-data:ami-id') }}
            
            ---- pillar tests ---
            salt.pillar.get: {{ salt.pillar.get('test:value') }}
            pillar.get: {{ pillar.get('test:value') }}
```

And in Pillar, `test:value` is set to `monkey`.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Run `salt-call state.sls test.sls`

**Expected behavior**

I expected these to be equivalent, but here are the actual results:
```$ cat /tmp/test.txt
--- salt tests ---
salt.grains.get: ami-08306577a6694f5e7
grains.get: None

---- pillar tests ---
salt.pillar.get: monkey
pillar.get: None
```
