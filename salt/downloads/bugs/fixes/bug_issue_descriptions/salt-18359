While debugging #18316 I noticed a log flood on the master:

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
```

After restarting this is fine for some time but then it happens again and never seems to be ending.
