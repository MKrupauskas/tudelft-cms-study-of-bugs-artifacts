Hello, 

since 2015.5.x and up to 2015.8.3 it is not working as expected (from me ^^) 

When I e.g. use as in documentation written (key is from documentation ;)):

```
myprofile:
    keyid: GKTADJGHEIQSXMKKRBJ08H
    key: askdjghsdfjkghWupUjasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs
    region: us-east-1
```

I can reference it as:

```
# Using a profile from pillars
Ensure mysecgroup exists:
    boto_secgroup.present:
        - name: mysecgroup
        - description: My security group
        - region: us-east-1
        - profile: myprofile
```

This is also possible if I put "aws." in front of it:

```
aws.myprofile:
    keyid: GKTADJGHEIQSXMKKRBJ08H
    key: askdjghsdfjkghWupUjasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs
    region: us-east-1
```

could be referenced as:

```
# Using a profile from pillars
Ensure mysecgroup exists:
    boto_secgroup.present:
        - name: mysecgroup
        - description: My security group
        - region: us-east-1
        - profile: aws.myprofile
    ....
```

But when I try to put all AWS stuff below pillar tree "aws" like:

```
aws:
  account: 123456789012
  wildcert: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:server-certificate/mycertificate'

  myprofile:
    keyid: GKTADJGHEIQSXMKKRBJ08H
    key: askdjghsdfjkghWupUjasdflkdfklgjsdfjajkghs
    region: us-east-1

  rds:
    myblog:
      ...
```

it fails to reference it as:

```
# Using a profile from pillars
Ensure mysecgroup exists:
    boto_secgroup.present:
        - name: mysecgroup
        - description: My security group
        - region: us-east-1
        - profile: aws:myprofile
```

wihle `aws:myprofile` should be the right referencing ?
Tests with `aws.myprofile` are also failling:

```
# Using a profile from pillars
Ensure mysecgroup exists:
    boto_secgroup.present:
        - name: mysecgroup
        - description: My security group
        - region: us-east-1
        - profile: aws.myprofile
```
