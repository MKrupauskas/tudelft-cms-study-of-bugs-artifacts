I am running Salt 2015.5.2 on a SUSE Linux Enterprise installation, and trying to use the Salt apache_module to enable Apache's proxy-module.

The state files is:

```
proxyfunction:
  apache_module.enable:
    - names:
      - proxy
      - proxy_http
```

This fails with the following error:

```
          ID: proxyfunction
    Function: apache_module.enable
        Name: proxy
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'apache_module.enable' was not found in SLS 'apache2.proxy'
```

Searching for similar issues, I found issue #19090 which sounds similar, but no real cause was found for the problem.

It looks as if the entire "apache" module is somewhat broken on SUSE. Just trying to get the Apache version fails:

```
# salt web001 apache.version
web001:
    'apache' __virtual__ returned False
```

So it may be a more general problem on SUSE Linux. There is an "apache2ctl" binary installed on SUSE, though.
