### Description of Issue/Question

Salt doesn't check for ssh key existence properly in test mode when port is set. The reason for this is that when port is specified, `known_hosts` file has entries formatted as `[host]:port`, not as `host`. It works ok outside of test mode.

I can fix it myself if this makes sense.
### Setup

``` yaml
/some/path/know_hosts-foo:
  ssh_known_hosts.present:
    - name: foo.example.com
    - port: 7999
    - user: root
    - config: /some/path/know_hosts
    - enc: ssh-rsa
    - fingerprint: de:ad:be:ef
    - hash_known_hosts: false
```
