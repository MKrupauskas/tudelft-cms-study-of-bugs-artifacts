Hello,

I'm currently using salt-cloud to deploy windows VM's on vsphere. For the most part it works great but when trying to delete for example

```
salt-cloud -d WIN_TEST
```

The VM only gets powered off and not deleted. I see in the code that it definitely tries to run a destroy but it doesn't seem to work no matter how many times  I run the delete. Here's some version info

```
