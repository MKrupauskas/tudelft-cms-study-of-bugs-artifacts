when installing memcache it prompts for input and stalls.  Pressing [Enter] makes it proceed.  To reproduce:

make sure to have php-pear and php5-dev installed.

```
php-pear:
  pkg.installed

php5-dev:
  pkg.installed

memcache:
  pecl.installed
  require:
    - pkg: php-pear
```

Additional notes:
Install from command line:  `sudo pecl install memcache`
Uninstall from command line: `sudo pecl uninstall memcache`
