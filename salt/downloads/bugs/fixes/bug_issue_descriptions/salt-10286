The OpenStack driver works like a champ on Rackspace and is definitely the preferred way to go, as listed in the docs on "Getting Started with Rackspace". The Rackspace "provider" is in a weird state right now though. _"The provider has the same name, so it should work right?"_ This is the kind of detail a user shouldn't have to deal with when working with the providers out of salt cloud. The barrier here should be exactly as simple as salt-cloud currently has users lay out their config (creds, region, etc.)

The Rackspace provider right now is intended for the legacy cloud (built as a libcloud example), and does strange things with current gen cloud. If someone bashes their way through trying to get the Rackspace provider to work on the OpenStack based Rackspace cloud, it reports success (it's lying). For example, If you ask to build in IAD, it will end up building in DFW.
## Example
### `cloud.providers`

```
rackspace-config:
  # Set the location of the salt-master
  #
  minion:
    master: HOST

  # Configure Rackspace using the OpenStack plugin
  #
  identity_url: 'https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens'
  compute_name: cloudServersOpenStack
  protocol: ipv4

  # Set the compute region:
  #
  compute_region: IAD

  # Configure Rackspace authentication credentials
  #
  user: USERNAME
  tenant: TENANT_ID
  apikey: APIKEY

  provider: openstack

old-rackspace-config:
  # Set the location of the salt-master
  minion:
    master: HOST

  # Set the compute region:
  compute_region: IAD

  user: USERNAME
  apikey: APIKEY

  provider: rackspace
```
### `cloud.profiles`

```
salamander:
    provider: rackspace-config
    size: 1 GB Performance
    image: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) (PVHVM)
salamander2:
    provider: old-rackspace-config
    size: 1 GB Performance
    image: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) (PVHVM)
```
### Let's build a box!

```
root@master:~# salt-cloud -p salamander2 testbox2
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting

        uri:

```

IAD != DFW

Can we just deprecate this module so people don't use it? The legacy cloud servers are well on their way out. I'm being very opinionated here to get this conversation out in the open and I'd like to know what you think.

Alternatively, we could just extend from the OpenStack provider. When I say extend, I mean that very loosely based on how [openstack.py](/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/openstack.py) is laid out.
