Salt-Call should setup the Raet Channel LaneStack and also close it when its done.
Currently it is set up in transport but then transport does not have a way to know when
to close it.

This wourl work similarly to they way the minion jobber stack works. The jobber sets up the stack
and then closes it when its done.
