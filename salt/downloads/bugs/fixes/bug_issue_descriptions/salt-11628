This is an issue for a problem reported on the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/salt-users/nyFmw7fUb5I/YJ2E2GsEZ_wJ

On FreeBSD, when running `salt '*' test.ping` I get an error:

on the client:
`Failed to authenticate, is this user permitted to execute commands?`
in the master log:
`[WARNING ] Authentication failure of type "user" occurred.`

The command is run as root. I get root via `su -`

If I start the master in foreground, it works. However, the logs show the user as `vlad`.

The workaround Chas mentions in the mailing list works: `LOGNAME=root; salt '*' test.ping` works both when the master is running in the foreground and when it's started via the init script. The user is also correctly logged as root in the logs.

The system is freebsd 9.2 running salt 2014.1.1 installed via ports.
