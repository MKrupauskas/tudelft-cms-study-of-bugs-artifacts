### Description of Issue/Question
Using network.managed for any interface and using ippaddrs, all ips w/in the ipaddrs list are ignored instead of generating a IPADDR0...X and GATEWAY/SUBNET0...X

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
```
lo:
  network.managed:
    - name: lo
    - type: eth
    - onboot: yes
    - userctl: no
    - ipaddrs:
      - 127.0.0.1/8
      - 10.234.0.73/32
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Use above state and note that your original ifcfg-lo which would look like this:
```
DEVICE=lo
IPADDR=127.0.0.1
NETMASK=255.0.0.0
NETWORK=127.0.0.0
# If you're having problems with gated making 127.0.0.0/8 a martian,
# you can change this to something else (255.255.255.255, for example)
BROADCAST=127.255.255.255
ONBOOT=yes
NAME=loopback
```

now looks like this:
```
DEVICE="lo"
HWADDR="00:00:00:00:00:00"
USERCTL="no"
TYPE="Ethernet"
ONBOOT="yes"
```

instead of something more realistic like this:
```
DEVICE="lo"
HWADDR="00:00:00:00:00:00"
USERCTL="no"
TYPE="Ethernet"
ONBOOT="yes"
IPADDR0="127.0.0.1"
NETMASK0="255.0.0.0"
IPADDR1="10.234.0.73"
NETMASK1="255.255.255.255"
```

Even on salt v2016.3.5, I get the same results, and it doesn't matter what IP ranges, subnets, interfaces, etc.. I choose.  Also, I used the example straight from https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.network.html#configuration-of-network-interfaces for configuration the loopback device and same results.  I'm trying to avoid keep doing the rc.local hack to add VIPs to servers or having to setup an ifcfg-lo template when ideally ipaddrs for network.managed should work.
