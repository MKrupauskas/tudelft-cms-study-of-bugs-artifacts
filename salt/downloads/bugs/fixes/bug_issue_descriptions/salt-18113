I went to manually build the docs today on the docs VM and one of the states was failing because `six` wasn't included. I added it to the list of mocked modules in #18099. After that was merged, I tried again, and now I am getting a new error:

                  Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.
