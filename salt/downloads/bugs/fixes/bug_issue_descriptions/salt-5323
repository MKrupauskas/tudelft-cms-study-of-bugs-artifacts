So I noticed today that my salt master isn't recognizing my increased amount of soft max files open levels. I've changed them for the root user and confirmed the changes with ulimit -Sn command. I've restarted the machine as well as restarted the salt-master and I'm still turning up nothing. It's still warning about the minion keys being greater than 25%. Specifically, here is the error in the master log:

2013-05-30 15:59:47,850 [salt.utils.verify][WARNING ] The number of accepted minion keys(424) should be lower than 1/4 of the max open files soft setting(1024). Please consider raising this value.

Additionally, here is the output of the versions-report:
