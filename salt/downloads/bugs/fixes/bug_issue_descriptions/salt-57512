**Description**
After upgrading Salt master from Python 2 to 3, we have noticed that our reactor fails to read secrets from Hashicorp Vault with the following error:

```
[salt.loaded.int.module.vault:172 ][ERROR ][150811] Failed to read secret! AssertionError: PID check failed. RNG must be re-initialized after fork(). Hint: Try Random.atfork()
```

**Setup**
Snippet from Salt master config:

```yml
reactor:
  - 'salt/job/*/ret/*':
    - salt://reactor/deploy/done.sls
```

Snippet from reactor:

```py
#!py

def run():
    ...
    my_secret = __salt__["vault.read_secret"]("path/to/secret", "my_secret")
    ...
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Make sure Vault is configured on Salt master
2. Invoke a job that would trigger the reactor, any state would do e.g. `salt foo state.apply bar`.
3. Observe error in master logs:

```
[salt.loaded.int.module.vault:172 ][ERROR ][150811] Failed to read secret! AssertionError: PID check failed. RNG must be re-initialized after fork(). Hint: Try Random.atfork()
```

**Expected behavior**
`__salt__["vault.read_secret"]` invoked in a reactor should succeed.
