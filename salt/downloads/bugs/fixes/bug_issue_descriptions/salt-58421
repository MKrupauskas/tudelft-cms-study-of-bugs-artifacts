**Description**
The function list_availability_zones is documented in the `salt(7)` man page:
>   **availability_zone**
>        **Required.** The availability zone that the instance is located in.  Available zones can be found using the list_availability_zones function:
> 
>           # salt-cloud -f list_availability_zones my-tencentcloud-config

This function is also listed as being available for EC2 in the salt-cloud features matrix: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/features.html

This function is defined in 3 of the salt-cloud drivers and documented in 2 of those 3:
```
$ git grep -l list_availability_zon
doc/man/salt.7
doc/topics/cloud/features.rst
doc/topics/cloud/tencentcloud.rst
salt/cloud/clouds/aliyun.py
salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py
salt/cloud/clouds/tencentcloud.py
```

It appears that this function was made private in the salt-cloud ec2 driver as part of #15515

It is not clear why the resolution to #15515 was to make `list_availability_zones()` private, but doing so removes a significant automation tool in managing AWS infrastructure. While AWS availability_zones are not subject to frequent changes, AWS does add new ones from time to time.

**Expected behavior**
Expected a list of AWS Availability Zones for the region defined by the salt-cloud provider.
