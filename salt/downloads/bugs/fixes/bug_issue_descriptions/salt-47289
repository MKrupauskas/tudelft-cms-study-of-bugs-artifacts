### unless option not working the same way between file.managed and git.latest

### Setup
```sls
git_directory:
  file.directory:
    - name: /usr/local/www/directory
    - user: git
    - unless: test -d /usr/local/www/directory
```

```sls
source_code:
  git.latest:
    - name: git@github.com:user/repository.git
    - target: /usr/local/www/directory
    - user: git
    - unless: test -d /usr/local/www/directory/.git
```

The former generates the following output:
```
[INFO    ] Executing command ‘test -d /usr/local/www/directory' in directory ‘/root’
```
While the last one generates the following output:
```
[INFO    ] Executing command ‘test -d /usr/local/www/directory/.git’ as user ‘git’ in directory ‘/home/git’
```

So it seems that in the former it runs the `unless` command using *root* user while in the last one uses *git* user.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Explained above with simple states.
