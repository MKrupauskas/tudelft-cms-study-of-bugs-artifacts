**Description**
All of the win_wua.list functions fail on most windows servers minions. If I downgrade salt to pervious version 3001 then the win_wua cmds work again. 

**Setup**
upgrade of salt windows server minion to 3002 breaks win_wua.list

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
salt OVH-AADCONNECT win_wua.list install=True
```
results in
```
OVH-AADCONNECT:
    'win_wua' __virtual__ returned False: WUA: The Background Intelligent Transfer service (bits) must not be disabled
```

**Expected behavior**
It should have listed and installed available windows updates

**Additional context**
If I downgrade back to 3001 then it all works as expected again. 
The slightly odd thing is that out of a mixed bunch 30 servers ( some core installs and some full GUI as old as 2012R2 all the way up to 2016 and 2019 it works even with salt minion 3002 on 4 out of 30 servers). 

I could not find a correlation of certain server releases or core or GUI installs that all failed or all succeeded, can't tell what makes 4 out of my 30 act differently and have a still working win_wua.list even on salt minion version 3002. 

But it fails with same error message on 26 out of 30 using slat minion 3002 and works on 30 out of 30 using slat minion 3001.  Let me know if you needs debug output or anything else I can provide to help find the problem. @twangboy is this to do with the win_wua fixes you added recently to deal with win 10 pro 2004 and 2009 windows updates issues 13f57328e2880afdc9804d6fff1c522e5d5c296d?
