Due to the change in #28951, all CloudLinux versions now have the os_family grain of 'CloudLinux Server'. This is because the `_OS_NAME_MAP` in `grains/core.py:929` was not updated to be consistent with the change.
The consequences of this, I'm sure you can imagine, are considerable and terminal to state execution.

Curently:
`'cloudserve': 'CloudLinux',`
This would need changing to:
`'cloudlinux: 'CloudLinux',`

This then cascades to also break the grains `osfinger` and `osmajorrelease` because they rely on `os_family`.
nb. Even setting a manual grain in `/etc/salt/grains` on the minion for `os_family: RedHat` does not fix the broken osfinger/osmajorrelease grains, as the test used to set these depends on the value of `os_family` determined earlier in `grains/core.py` (this is, perhaps, another problem; that manual grains are not respected during determination of other values)
