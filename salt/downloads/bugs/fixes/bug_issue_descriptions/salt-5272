salt-master 0.15.1 (from pip), Python 2.7.5 (via pythonz), on Wheezy starts with the following problem (repeated for every process)

```
[ERROR   ] Unable to import "sourceslist" from "aptsources" module: No module named softwareproperties.ppa
```

apt-get installing libapt-pkg-dev and pip installing python-apt solves the problem.
