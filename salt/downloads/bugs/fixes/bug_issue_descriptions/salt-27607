After upgrading master/minion to 2015.8.0 the state at.present no longer works to create scheduled jobs.  The module does work; however, the state does not.

State file executed with state.sls: `salt * state.sls upgradeMinion.attest saltenv=prod`

Example Used:

``` salt
at_test:
  at:
    - present
    - job: 'ls -lah > /tmp/test.txt'
    - timespec: 'now + 1 minute'
    - tag: upgrademinion
    - user: root
```

Works on 2015.5.3; however, it fails after the minion upgrade to 2015.8.0.  Appears that the at.py file is identical in both 2015.5.3 and 2015.8.0 versions.  So assuming problem is up/down stream of the at.py present function.
