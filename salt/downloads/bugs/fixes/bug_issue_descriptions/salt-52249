### Description of Issue/Question

For Salt 2018.3.[3|4], we have noticed that when we run certain `salt-cloud` commands (say, with `-Q` and/or `-m`) a message appears suggesting a failed publication _just prior_ to the expected output:
```
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

As an example, running `salt-cloud -Q` generates the following output:
```
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
aws:
    ----------
    ec2:
        ----------
        20190318-SaltStack-lab1-minion01:
            ----------
            id:
                i-0ba845d80650857f2
```

I brought this to the attention of @techhat ...

He took a look and came to this conclusion:
```so no, nothing in salt-cloud should be calling salt.client with -Q... but there may be an import that salt cloud uses that started using salt.client in a place that it hadnt before```

To be clear, the Salt Cloud commands work as expected, however the initial output with the error has been confusion for some customers.

Goal would be to identify the cause of:
```No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.```
and to correct it.

### Setup
Install Salt 2018.3.4 and setup a basic EC2 provider configuration

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
This was vetted with a standard provider setup for EC2 and running `salt-cloud -Q` or `salt-cloud -m foo.map`

### Versions Report
Salt 2018.3.3 / 2018.3.4 on RHEL 7.6
