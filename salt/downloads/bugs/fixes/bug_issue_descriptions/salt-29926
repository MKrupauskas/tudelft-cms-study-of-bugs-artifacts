After upgrade to SaltStack 2015.8.3 we discovered that Mine is working inconsistently in MultiMaster environment.
So for example we have 5 (h1, m1, m2, m3, m4) minions and 2 (h1, m1) masters. All minions are connected to both masters.
In minion config we configured grains to be added to mine:

```
mine_functions:
  grains.items: []
```

Lets clean mine cache on masters:

```
rm -rf /var/cache/salt/master/minions/*/mine.p
```

After restart of all masters and minions and "salt * mine.update" we see that on one master grains were reported for 2 minions and on another master only for 3 minions:

```
[root@h1 salt]# salt h1 mine.get \* grains.items 
h1:
    ----------
    m1:
...
    m3:
...

[root@m1 ~]# salt h1 mine.get \* grains.items 
h1:
    ----------
    h1:
...
    m2:
...
    m4:
...
```

So for some reason part of minions reported its grains to mine on one master and another part of minions to the second master.. The same behaviour could be observed if mine_functions were configured through pillar.

Do you have any idea why it could happen? Looking forward to your reply.
