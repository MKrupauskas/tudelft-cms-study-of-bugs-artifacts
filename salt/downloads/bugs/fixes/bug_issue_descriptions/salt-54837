### Description of Issue
The https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/44578/files changes added support for enable_ssh_minions, but didn't update conf/master.   

I can add 'enable_ssh_minions: True' to /etc/salt/master to enable to feature, but /etc/salt/master should include the option documentation and default value like the rest of the master options.

Suggested diff:

    diff --git a/conf/master b/conf/master
