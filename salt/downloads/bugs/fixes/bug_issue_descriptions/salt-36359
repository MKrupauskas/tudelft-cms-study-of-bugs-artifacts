### Description of Issue/Question

After upgrading to 2016.3.3, I get the following warning on each `salt-call` execution:

```
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/grains/core.py:1493: DeprecationWarning: The "osmajorrelease" will be a type of an integer.
```

After running a recursive grep through all of my state and pillar files, I have come to the conclusion that I'm not using this anywhere. If I'm not using it, I shouldn't be warned about it.

In my opinion, warnings tell you that you are doing something wrong, and there could be a potential problem or a better way to do something. Things not applicable to my setup should not produce warnings, and documenting the change in release notes would be more appropriate.

Each time I see a warning, I try to be proactive and correct it. It's a waste of time and mental energy to investigate warnings on each execution that AFAICT aren't applicable to me.
### Setup

I suspect the warning will appear regardless of the states in use.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use `salt-call` to do basically anything.

The salt-minion package is built using the `v2016.3.3` tagged git commit (which was tagged incorrectly again since it did not include the version bump). That's a different issue.
