Hi,

I'm running almost exclusively CentOS 6 minions, and there seems to be a bug whenever you run `pkg.installed` more than once, but ONLY on 2015.8.1.  2015.8.0 is fine.

Here's the stack trace I get from the command line:

```

    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

And here's the state definition in the sls file:

```
...

install-ntpd:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - pkgs:
      - ntp
      - ntpdate
      - ntp-doc

...
```

To clarify, both master and minion are running salt 2015.8.1, but the master is on 14.04.3 LTS, while my minions are on CentOS 6.5.
