**Description**
`saltutil.running` returns no data on a Windows minion during a state run (the `proc` dir is empty)

**Setup**
Windows 2019 Server minion
3001 and 3002 minion tested
master/minion environment

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Execute a state that runs for a few minutes.  Observe the `proc` dir on the minion is empty.  Execute the saltutil.running command on the minion, no data is returned.  

Attempts to run another state concurrently are not met with an error about concurrency, they are either executed as if `concurrent=True` were passed or the "IOLoop already running" error is thrown.

**Expected behavior**
Job data is returned by saltutil.running (this functions as expected on 2019.2, I haven't tested 3000)
