CC @basepi as this is a total road block with salt-ssh on 2016.3.0. We cannot run anything.
### Description of Issue/Question

Any call to salt-ssh fails with `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'BASE_THORIUM_ROOTS_DIR'`
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
The gist here is that we use a SaltFile and relative paths in our master config. Do note none of our config or states seem relevant as far as I can tell. The code fails really early.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run any salt-ssh invocation on any target.

```
$ salt-ssh -l debug myhost test.ping
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/bin/salt-ssh", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(salt_ssh())
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 385, in salt_ssh
    import salt.cli.ssh
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/ssh.py", line 5, in <module>
    import salt.client.ssh
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 29, in <module>
    import salt.config
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/config/__init__.py", line 37, in <module>
    import salt.syspaths
  File "/home/user/venv/salt-dev/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/syspaths.py", line 97, in <module>
    BASE_THORIUM_ROOTS_DIR = __generated_syspaths.BASE_THORIUM_ROOTS_DIR
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'BASE_THORIUM_ROOTS_DIR'
```
### Versions Report

Cannot get this due to the error, traceback same as above for `salt-ssh --versions-report`

salt-ssh = 2016.3.0
python = 2.7.10
Gentoo 

I am happy to provide any further information you may be interested in.
