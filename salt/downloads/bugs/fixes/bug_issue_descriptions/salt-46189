### Description of Issue/Question

When using check_cmd on the installation of a configuration file with file.managed, salt installs a temporary file using the standard python call tempfile.mkstemp() before running the check_cmd. This call defaults the temp dir to /tmp. But some apparmor profiles prevent the daemon from accessing /tmp for security reasons (failing with EPERM -- permission denied).

This is the case on e.g. Ubuntu 16.04 and isc-dhcp-server:

```
# apt install isc-dhcp-server
# touch /tmp/salt
# dhcpd -t -cf /tmp/salt

Can't open /tmp/salt: Permission denied
```

This is how salt creates the temporary file:
```
salt/states/file.py (line 2398):
    tmp_filename = salt.utils.files.mkstemp(suffix=tmp_ext)

salt/utils/__init__.py (line 3489):
def mkstemp(*args, **kwargs):
    ...
    fd_, fpath = tempfile.mkstemp(*args, **kwargs)
    ...
```

There are several ways to resolve or workaround this issue, nr. 1 seems to me the most effective.

1. Allow users to set the temp directory using a tmp_dir statement similar to the existing tmp_ext statement in file.managed.
1. Make upstream fix the apparmor profile so that checking a new config file doesn't violate it.
1. Add a statement to the apparmor profile allowing config files to be read from /tmp:
```
# touch /tmp/salt
# echo "/tmp/salt r," > /etc/apparmor.d/dhcpd.d/allow.tmp
# apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.dhcpd
# dhcpd -t -cf /tmp/salt
# echo $?
0
```
1. Use a mini script to copy the config file to an allowed directory before running the check command:
```
    - check_cmd: |
        sh -c '
        export TMPDIR=$(dirname "{{ dhcpd.config }}") ;
        TMPFILE="$(mktemp)" ;
        cp "$0" "${TMPFILE}" ;
        dhcpd -t -cf "${TMPFILE}" ;
        ERROR="$?" ;
        rm -f "${TMPFILE}" ;
        exit $ERROR '
```

### Setup
On Ubuntu 16.04 in /tmp/srv:

top.sls:
```
base:
  '*':
    - checkcmd
```

checkcmd.sls:
```
isc-dhcp-server:
  pkg.installed

/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf:
  file.managed:
    - contents: ""
    - check_cmd: dhcpd -t -cf
    - require:
      - pkg: isc-dhcp-server
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
# salt-call --local --file-root=/tmp/srv state.highstate
...
