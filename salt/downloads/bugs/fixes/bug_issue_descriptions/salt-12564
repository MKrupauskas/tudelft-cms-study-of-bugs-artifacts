With python 2.7, and salt 17.5 we ran into a problem when using a template that was generated by a webservice. Essentially, we had:

```
filename:
  file.managed:
    source: http://templateservice.com/template.jinja
    template: jinja
```

Which caused:

```
"/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/utils/templates.py", line 166, in render_jinja_tmpl
    unicode_context[key] = unicode(value, 'utf-8')
TypeError: decoding Unicode is not supported
```

(In the develop branch this bug still exists, on line 261 I believe)

It appears that there was an attempt to avoid this on line 255, however, I noticed that unicode strings are considered an instance of basestring (which is what string_types is set to on python 2.x). This causes it to attempt to re-encode the unicode string, causing the exception.
