There seems to be an issue with seed.apply (actually, It affects also virt.init). The problem is that the image is never seeded with the minion. I tried it on an Ubuntu server 15.04, a Debian-8 guest image and salt version, 2015.5.0.

The command: `salt 'id' seed.apply /srv/salt/vm-images/debian_test_chroot.qcow2 guest1` (the same happens with other images I tried)

Returns always False and nothing is installed.

I debugged it and I found the following:

``` python
salt/modules/seed.py:_install(mtp):

    cmd = 'if type salt-minion; then exit 0; '
    cmd += 'else sh {0} -c /tmp; fi'.format(salt.syspaths.BOOTSTRAP)
```

Which evaluates to:

```
ipdb> cmd
"chroot /tmp/guest/srv.salt-images.debian_test_chroot.system.qcow2 /bin/bash -c 'if type salt-minion; then exit 0; else sh /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/deploy/bootstrap-salt.sh -c /tmp; fi'"
```

The problem is that `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/deploy/bootstrap-salt.sh` is outside the chroot, so, when it tries to execute the command, the result is: `"/bin/bash: line 0: type: salt-minion: not found\nsh: 0: Can't open /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/deploy/bootstrap-salt.sh\n"`
