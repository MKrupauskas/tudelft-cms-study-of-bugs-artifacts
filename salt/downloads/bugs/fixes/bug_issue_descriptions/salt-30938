I just upgraded a Windows minion from 2015.8.0 to 2015.8.5 and noticed that the prior `minion` config file was overwritten. I thought based on the closing of a handful of other issues that this was no longer occurring, but it does not seem to be fixed yet.

It would really be nice to merge settings from a prior `minion` config file into the new `minion` config file.
