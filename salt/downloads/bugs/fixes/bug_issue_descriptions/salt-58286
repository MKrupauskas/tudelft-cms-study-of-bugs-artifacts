**Description**

Can not install salt-proxy on Debian 10 using 2019.2 repository.

**Setup**
Using Debian 10 with the following apt source defined:

`deb http://repo.saltstack.com/py3/debian/10/amd64/2019.2 buster main`

Attempting to install `salt-proxy` fails with the following error:

```
apt install salt-proxy
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 salt-proxy : Depends: salt-minion (= 2018.3.4+dfsg1-6+deb10u1) but 2019.2.5+ds-1 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
Only the Debian supplied package is available for salt-proxy
```
apt-cache policy salt-proxy
salt-proxy:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 2018.3.4+dfsg1-6+deb10u1
  Version table:
     2018.3.4+dfsg1-6+deb10u1 500

        500 http://<aptcache-server>/debian buster/main amd64 Packages
```

The salt-master package is found in the saltstack repository, which confirms the source is configured correctly.
```
apt-cache policy salt-master
salt-master:
  Installed: 2019.2.5+ds-1
  Candidate: 2019.2.5+ds-1
  Version table:
 *** 2019.2.5+ds-1 500

        500 http://<aptcache-server>/debian buster/main amd64 Packages
```

Fetching the repository package list also confirms salt-proxy is missing
```
# curl -s http://repo.saltstack.com/py3/debian/10/amd64/2019.2/dists/buster/main/binary-amd64/Packages | egrep Package:
Package: salt-api
Package: salt-cloud
Package: salt-common
Package: salt-master
Package: salt-minion
Package: salt-ssh
Package: salt-syndic
```


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Configure 2019.2 debian 10 repository source
2. Install salt-proxy.

**Expected behavior**
salt-proxy package should exist and install cleanly when resolving dependencies.
