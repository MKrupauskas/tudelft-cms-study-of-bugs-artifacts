Hi,

We have occasions where crons have been temporarily disabled  (commented out) and then forgotten, leaving them permanently disabled.  A "persist" option, or something equivalent for cron.present to ensure that managed crons are enabled would be really handy for situations like this.

Thanks in advance!
