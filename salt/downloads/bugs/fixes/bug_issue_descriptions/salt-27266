So I know I can watch a directory for changes, but I would like to trigger a service restart at the end of a salt run with listen. Unfortunately, that does not appear to be supported.

Salt returns the following

```
----------
          ID: listen_/etc/sensu/conf.d*
    Function: Listen_Error.Listen_Error
        Name: listen_file
      Result: False
     Comment: Referenced state file: /etc/sensu/conf.d* does not exist
     Started:
    Duration:
     Changes:
```

and the corresponding snippet from my SLS file

```
sensu-client:
  service.running:
   [...]
    - listen:
      - file: /etc/sensu/conf.d/*
```

For the short term, I will revert back to watch, but I feel like this behavior should also exist for listen.
