Hi all,

I'm getting an IOError when executing a salt state that includes the following:

``` yaml
npm_install:
    cmd.run:
        - name: "npm install"
        - user: root
        - cwd: /home/vagrant/blog/Ghost
        - require:
            - pkg: nodejs
```

You'll also notice i'm running this with vagrant. A precise64 box with default settings to be exact.

This seems to happen at random, and at no certain point during the npm install. If I run `salt-call state.sls` a few times it eventually succeeds. The error is as follows:

```

I don't mind providing all my `.sls` files etc if necessary to reproduce - I just wanted to check if this was something obvious first. Is this a bug or could it be i'm missing something?
