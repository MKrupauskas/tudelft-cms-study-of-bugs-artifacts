The document page below says that "s3 compatible URLs" can be used with file.managed and file.append.

http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html

> **source**
> A single source file to append. This source file can be hosted on either the salt master server, or on an HTTP or FTP server. Both HTTPS and HTTP are supported as well as downloading directly from Amazon S3 compatible URLs with both pre-configured and automatic IAM credentials (see s3.get state documentation). File retrieval from Openstack Swift object storage is supported via swift://container/object_path URLs (see swift.get documentation).

The code does not support this and it doesn't seem possible.

```
  file.managed:
    - source: s3://bucketname/base/file.conf
    - name: /etc/thing/file.conf
```

The error returned from the highstate call is:

```
    Function: file.managed
        Name: /etc/thing/file.conf
      Result: False
     Comment: Unable to determine upstream hash of source file s3://bucketname/base/file.conf

```

The line of code that returns that is at the bottom of the [highlighted block](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.1.10/salt/modules/file.py#L2114-L2145).

I'm using the latest stable version, 2014.1.10, but it appears to be effectively the same in the [develop branch](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/file.py#L2526-L2558)

The docs should be updated to remove this incorrect reference to being able to use S3 URLs, or this should be considered a feature request for the ability to use s3://bucket/path/to/file URLs in the source parameter of `salt.states.file.managed` (and whatever module is upstream of it).
