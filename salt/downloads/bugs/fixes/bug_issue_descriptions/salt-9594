When trying to install a package via python client's API using this:

```
local.cmd(machineX, 'pkg.install', pkgs='["python-mako"]')
```

returns this:

```
{'machineX': {}}
```

During debugging, the minion was using the yumpkg.py module instead of the yumpkg5.py (the later is used by the CLI install command instead).

(Used the bootstrap script in order to install salt minion and came with the module yumpkg)

output of test.versions_report
