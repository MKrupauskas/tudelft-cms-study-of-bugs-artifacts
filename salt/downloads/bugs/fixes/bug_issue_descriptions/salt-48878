### Description of Issue/Question
I am using salt-cloud, and have a DigitalOcean provider configured.  It previously worked as 'digital_ocean', but now generates the error:
The cloud driver, 'digital_ocean', configured under the 'coderz-do' cloud provider alias, could not be loaded. Please check your provider configuration files and ensure all required dependencies are installed for the 'digital_ocean' driver.
However, changing the driver to digitalocean does work.  It's a simple fix, but I am posting the issue to hopefully save someone else the frustration.

### Setup
`coderz-do:`
`   driver: digitalocean`
`   personal_access_token: 'my token'`
`   ssh_key_file: /etc/salt/keys/salt.pem`
`   ssh_key_names: salt`
`   securitygroup: default`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Change driver from 'digitalocean' to 'digital_ocean'
