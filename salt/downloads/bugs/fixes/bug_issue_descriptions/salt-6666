When running a state which checks that a service is running, salt calls `sc showsid <service>` (from `getsid()` in `salt/modules/win_service.py`). For example:

```
C:\salt>salt-call service.status nxlog
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc query "nxlog"' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\djs-admin'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc showsid "nxlog"' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\djs-admin'
```

This stalls. Pressing enter continues the execution. Running `sc showsid nxlog` at the command line produces the following:

```
C:\>sc showsid nxlog

ERROR:  Unrecognized command

The SID doesn't seem to be used for anything. I guess the call should just not be made on Windows Server 2003.
