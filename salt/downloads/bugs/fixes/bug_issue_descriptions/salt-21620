There are plenty of examples of using network.managed and setting `delay: 0`, but this appears to be broken on redhat because of the template logic.  The code in question does this:

```
{% if delay %}DELAY="{{delay}}"{% endif %}
```

Unfortunately, when delay is set to 0, this fails the test and the DELAY line is never added.

If this is changed to:

```
{% if delay or delay == 0 %}DELAY="{{delay}}"{% endif %}
```

then it seems to do what we want.
