### Description of Issue/Question

When using `chocolatey.installed` [the docs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.chocolatey.html) state:

> Install a specific version of the package. Defaults to latest version. **If the version is different to the one installed then the specified version will be installed.** Default is None.

This seems not to be the case. When I install the `php` package in version `7.1.5`, then update my sls file to install `7.1.7` salt prints `The Package php is already installed` and does not touch it.

### Setup

```
install_php_package:
  chocolatey.installed:
    - name: php
    - version: '7.1.5' 
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run the above sls file and check your php version with `php -v`. Then change the version in the sls file to `7.1.7` and run salt again. If you check your php version again it's still `7.1.5`

### Versions Report

I have also tested this on `2016.11.7` with the same result.
