As mentioned by @whytewolf in #26099 the pillar-keys for keystone-credentials should be identical for all OpenStack-related modules.

I've [got a branch](https://github.com/0xf10e/salt/tree/fix_glance_mod_cred) where I changed this but this causes strange 404s:

``` python-traceback
operator@master:/srv/salt/saltstack.git% sudo salt \* saltutil.sync_all saltenv=base,openstack; sudo salt -C 'hw-ctrl or controller' glance.image_list
[...]
controller:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):

        schema = self.schemas.get('image')
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/glanceclient/v2/schemas.py", line 84, in get
        _, raw_schema = self.http_client.json_request('GET', uri)

      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/glanceclient/common/http.py", line 249, in _http_request
        raise exc.from_response(resp, body_str)
    HTTPNotFound: {"error": {"message": "The resource could not be found.", "code": 404, "title": "Not Found"}} (HTTP 404)
```

Couldn't figure out how this happens yet but I think we should get this fixed before Beryllium gets released.
