### Description of Issue/Question

The git state and module does not work on Windows when using an Identity file. I was able to pinpoint some issues, but in the end I could not get it to work. Please note that I haven't tried it before 2016.3, however I assume that the issue also occurs in prior versions.

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2016.3/salt/modules/git.py#L197 git ssh is, at least on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 7 from my testing, installed at C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ssh.exe  and not C:\Program Files\Git\bin\ssh.exe
Additionally, it should already be within PATH, so I do not see a reason why it should be looked up at a specific file path, maybe this should only be a fallback?

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2016.3/salt/modules/git.py#L217 
The SSH module throws "The module cannot be loaded on windows" when used on windows, this, afaict, will never work.
### Setup

Something like this (please note that this is not the actual SLS I've used, however it should come pretty close)

```
ensure git is installed:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: git
    - reload_modules: true
ensure repo:
  git.latest:
    - name: "git@github.com:saltstack/salt.git"
    - target: "C:/tmp"
    - identity: "C:/id_rsa"
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Using the git module with parameter identity on windows.
