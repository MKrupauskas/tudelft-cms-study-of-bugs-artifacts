IPoIB interfaces configured by salt (tested on versions up to v2015.2.0rc1-3112-g45dae90) on RHEL7 using the ip.build_interface module/network.managed state don't start on boot due to a missing "TYPE=InfiniBand" directive in the interface configuration file. I don't know the best way to solve this - One way might be to add another interface type to "rh_ip.py" which adds the necessary directive and skips the call to salt.utils.validate.net.mac() (IPoIB MAC addresses are longer than Ethernet MAC addresses). 

For reference, this issue is explained in section 9.6.3 of the [RHEL7 networking guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/pdf/Networking_Guide/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-7-Networking_Guide-en-US.pdf)

This likely applies to older versions of RHEL as well, but I haven't tested.
