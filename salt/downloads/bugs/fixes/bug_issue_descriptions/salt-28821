Is there a way to specify in /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/my-ec2-profile.conf that salt-cloud should not provision a public IP for an EC2 instance?  I am using the below settings, but the instance still comes online with a public IP address: (AssociatePublicIpAddress may be for an Elastic IP)

 network_interfaces:
      - DeviceIndex: 0
        PrivateIpAddresses:
          - Primary: True
        AssociatePublicIpAddress: False

In my /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/aws.conf I have specified the following:

ssh_interface: private_ips

But the above is to ask Salt to use the private ip and not public IP when connecting to the instance.
