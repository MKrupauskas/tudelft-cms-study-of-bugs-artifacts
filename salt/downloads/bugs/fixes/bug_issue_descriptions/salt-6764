Hi together,

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1,1K Aug 17 17:21 highstate.cache.p

in /var/cache/salt/minion is global readable. The problem is if there are any security related informations (e.g. password from a pillar) in a state file, any user on the system can see this.

Maybe the complete /var/cache/salt/minion directory could be 700 by default. Are there any problems with this rights? 

cheers,

Sebastian
