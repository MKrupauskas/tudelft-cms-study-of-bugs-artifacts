We have built custom package `parted` and modified it's `Release` to be different from one in CentOS-Base repo. Package is installed inside kickstart script, so it is not available in any repo.
`pkg.installed` state fails for this package with following error:

``` yaml
local:
----------
          ID: common-pkgs
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following package(s) were not found, and no possible matches were found in the package db: parted
     Started: 07:20:46.394947
    Duration: 7352.118 ms
     Changes:   
```

After little digging I localized problem to `pkg.check_db` function, which fails to find it in repo db:

``` bash
$ salt node pkg.check_db parted
node:
    ----------
    parted:
        ----------
        found:
            False
        suggestions:

Here is details on this package:

``` bash
$ yum info parted
