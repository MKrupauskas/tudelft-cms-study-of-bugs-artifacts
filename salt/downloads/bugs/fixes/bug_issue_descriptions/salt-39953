### Description of Issue

As in grains/core.py the **os_family** evaluates on all SuSE-platforms to the string "Suse".
In certain modules, the os_family string is compared agains "SUSE", which will never become true - even if it should be on the related check. This is causing some modules to malfunction.

See core.py lines 1145-1153

### Setup
I am running 2016.11.1, but I see the same issue in the current development branch here on Github.

The following example refers to the timezone module.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Install SLES11 (notably not SLES12, as this has systemd's "timeanddatectl" causing the module to function in a different way).
2. Execute "timezone.zone_compare"

```
salt-call -l trace timezone.zone_compare 'America/Denver'
[... non relevant lines omitted ...]
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded timezone.zone_compare
[TRACE   ] 'timedatectl' could not be found in the following search path: '['/sbin', '/usr/sbin', '/usr/local/sbin', '/root/bin', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin', '/bin', '/usr/bin/X11', '/usr/X11R6/bin', '/usr/games', '/opt/quest/bin', '/opt/symantec', '/opt/six/midrange/uvscan', '/opt/six/midrange/rkhunter', '/usr/openv/netbackup/bin', '/opt/ctmadmin', '/opt/ctmagent', '/opt/Sterling', '/opt/uc4/executor/bin', '/usr/lib/mit/bin', '/usr/lib/mit/sbin']'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 197, in call
    ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/timezone.py", line 259, in zone_compare
    curtzstring = get_zone()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/timezone.py", line 154, in get_zone
    raise CommandExecutionError('Unable to get timezone')
CommandExecutionError: Unable to get timezone
```

The cause for this sits in line 171 of modules/timezone.py, as the 'SUSE' will not be evaluated, causing "_get_zone_sysconfig()" not to be executed - which would have returned a correct value. This finally causes to reach the raise command, causing the exception as seen above. Note: As SLES11 does not have "timedatectl", it must evaluate the timezone via /etc/sysconfig/clock.

I assume there are more errornous occurances of this issue:
```
# grep \'SUSE\' *.py
apache.py:    elif os_family == 'Debian' or os_family == 'SUSE':
iptables.py:    elif __grains__['os_family'] == 'SUSE':
localemod.py:    elif 'SUSE' in __grains__['os_family']:
localemod.py:    elif 'SUSE' in __grains__['os_family']:
localemod.py:    on_suse = __grains__.get('os_family') == 'SUSE'
rh_service.py:        'SUSE',
rh_service.py:        if __grains__['os'] == 'SUSE':
service.py:        'SUSE',
service.py:    if __grains__.get('os_family', '') == 'SUSE':
timezone.py:        for family in ('RedHat', 'SUSE'):
timezone.py:    elif 'SUSE' in __grains__['os_family']:
timezone.py:        for family in ('RedHat', 'SUSE'):
timezone.py:    elif 'SUSE' in __grains__['os_family']:
```

Suggested fix: either update the match to 'Suse' or add .lower() and compare to 'suse' (and 'redhat').
