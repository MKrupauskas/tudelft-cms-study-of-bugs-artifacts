When using [firewalld](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.firewalld.html) state module in an SLS file, the highstate output returns a dictionary - see sample output below. Saltstack version is 2015.8.0 (Beryllium) on both master and minion.

According to a discussion on the #salt IRC channel, contributor @babilen indicated this is an issue because _firewalld returns a dictionary rather than a string in the ret['comment'] which probably causes the whole datastructure to be rendered as a dictionary_
