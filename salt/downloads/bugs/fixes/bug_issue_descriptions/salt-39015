### Description of Issue/Question
reload_modules: True is available for any salt state for use and is documented here
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/a380c12159a3a6691081d30e33c16e6f534c4482/doc/ref/states/requisites.rst

many formulas are using reload_modules along with pkg.installed to reload modules after installing a python library, for example python-pymongo, python-mysql
```
mysql_python:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: {{ mysql.python }}
    - reload_modules: True
```
unfortunately, it hurts performance really badly!
the modules are reloaded even if the state reported no changes!
(this is a logical failure, provided that the state reports it's "changes" properly)

I have two proposed fixes:
1. Introduce
```
reload_modules: onchange
```
and let all formulas adapt over time, to help with performance

2.
Make reload_modules work ONLY if the state reported changes.
This creates a minor incompatibility in further versions in case someone uses reload_modules along with some buggy or logically-incomplete module...
But I think it would make more sense.
