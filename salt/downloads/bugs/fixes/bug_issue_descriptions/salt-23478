I was playing with one of our new VMs and wanted to detect if it was a virtual machine or not and ran into this on our new Bhyve based VMs:

```
bcjk-tst01% sudo salt-call grains.get virtual
local:
    physical
```

I'm not sure of the correct way to detect this, but this seems to be a good indicator:

```
bcjk-tst01% sysctl -a | grep -i bvxsdt
dev.acpi.0.%desc: BHYVE BVXSDT
```

salt would still need to detect a linux (or other) host on Bhyve as well.
