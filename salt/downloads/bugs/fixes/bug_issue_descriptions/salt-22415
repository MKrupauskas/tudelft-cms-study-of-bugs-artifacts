As stated many times in the [docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.gpg.html), the passing the `salt` option as user argument has a special meaning:
<code>
Passing the user as 'salt' will set the GPG home directory to /etc/salt/gpg.
</code>

This works for most of the modules I've tested, but not for gpg.trust_key. The offending line is [this one](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/gpg.py#L820), as it tries to run as user `salt`, which does not exist. There might be more occurences of this mistake.

Other than that, the docs are wrong every time `/etc/salt/gpg` is referred to. The actual directory used is `/etc/salt/gpgkeys`.

Those issue(s) affect `develop` as well as `2015.2`.
