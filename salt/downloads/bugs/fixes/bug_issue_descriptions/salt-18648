We've had a problem since upgrading to 2014.7.0 that after longer period of time of the minions being online they become non-responsive after sending them a saltutil.refresh_pillar. This is affecting about 70% of our minions. The good thing is that these minions are always the same on which ones return and which ones don't.

Here is how we can reproduce the issue:

1) Start up the master & minions, let them be running for several hours.

2) Perform a `salt \* saltutil.refresh_pillar -v` - This runs fine and returns for all the minions.

3) Perform a `salt \* test.ping -v` - Only 30% of our minions will return this. 

These minions will no longer respond to commands. What is even more crazy is the job id won't show up in the cache. The test.ping doesn't show up in the minion's log. I've reviewed the master's log and nothing stood out to me.

So I'm willing to try some other debugging methods and what not, just at a point where I need some help diagnosing what is going on.
