This is probably related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/4630, as I'm experiencing the same problem.

I can't list available package and I can't install anything on Windows x64 minions using salt 0.16.3 on both minions and master (CentOS).

I run the following commands on the master:

```
[root]# salt-run winrepo.genrepo => lists a lot of packages
[root]# salt '*' pkg.refresh_db => True
[root]# salt '*' pkg.available_version firefox -v -t 200
Executing job with jid 20130826102307928029
-------------------------------------------

myhost:

[root]# 
```

Only empty response.

Not sure that this is a bug, or if I'm doing something wrong here.
