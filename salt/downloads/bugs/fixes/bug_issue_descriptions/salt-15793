Hi,

currently, _ebuild.refresh_db_ will fallback to webrsync whenever `emerge --sync` ends with `retcode != 0`.
You never ever want this! This is really bad. Think about the following situation:

You are using your own portage tree to control the software in your network (similar of running your own Debian mirror with your own packages).
If for any reason a client cannot sync against your mirror (maybe your mirror is down for maintenance) the current code would result in pulling in a software repository from an "unknown"/uncontrolled source.

Imagine you replaced the mysql package by your own one. Now, because your mirror is down, salt would pull in the mysql package from your distribution and maybe replaces all your mysql daemons... If this package is incompatible because your own package introduced another storage engine... this will kill your servers.

`eix.sync` has the same design flaw.
