If you run Salt without a master, it could occur that you'd still get an error complaining about a master:

```
 Specified SLS nginx.ng.config in saltenv local is not available on the salt master
```

Perhaps the "on the salt master" part should be removed (in case it is running masterless) to prevent unclear errors?
