**Description**

The [tls execution module](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.tls.html#module-salt.modules.tls) creates private keys which are world readable, this includes the CA key. I have been able to reproduce the issue using the CLI examples from the documentation.

**Setup**
No config files and/or SLS files required to reproduce, other than a working Salt setup.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

```
# salt-call tls.create_ca my_little days=5 CN='My Little CA' C=US ST=Utah L='Salt Lake City' O=Saltstack emailAddress=pleasedontemail@example.com
local:
    Created Private Key: "/etc/pki/my_little/my_little_ca_cert.key." Created CA "my_little": "/etc/pki/my_little/my_little_ca_cert.crt."
#  ls -l /etc/pki/my_little/my_little_ca_cert.key
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1704 Aug  4 19:13 /etc/pki/my_little/my_little_ca_cert.key
# salt-call tls.create_csr my_little CN=www.example.com
local:
    Created Private Key: "/etc/pki/my_little/certs/www.example.com.key." Created CSR for "www.example.com": "/etc/pki/my_little/certs/www.example.com.csr."
# ls -l /etc/pki/my_little/certs/www.example.com.key
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  1704 Aug  4 19:14 /etc/pki/my_little/certs/www.example.com.key
```

As you can see the newly created CA key as well as the key belonging to `www.example.com` are world readable. This is even more a problem due to the fact the parent directory (i.e. `/etc/pki/my_little`) is also created world readable which allows any user to navigate to it and obtain a directory listing.

**Expected behavior**
Sensitive material such as private keys should not be created world readable; see [CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html).

No difference in versions between the master and minions.

**Additional context**
It seems there is [code already present](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/tls.py#L844) to handle the case of an existing CA key  but this was not extended to apply to all private key material.
