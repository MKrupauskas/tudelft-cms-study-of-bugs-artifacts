**Description**
It appears that the win_lgpo state module gets confused if a security setting value contains a comma. For instance, property "Audit Logon Events" fully on should be "Success, Failure". However, under some state files, trying to set that value will result in it being set to "Success" only. 

The win_lgpo command line module works fine; it seems to be an issue with using the *state* module. Also, if I create a state with only 1 security setting, it seems to work. I see the problem when the setting is part of a bigger list, so I am guessing it is a parsing problem on bulk results (my debugging seemed to show that Salt fetches blocks of GPO entries).

**Setup**
This policy file contains a small set (commented out) which does work, and a big set which produces the bad results.
```
# update the group policy right after changing settings
group-policy-update:
  cmd.wait:
    - name: 'gpupdate /force'

# good_policy:
#   lgpo.set:
#     - computer_policy:
#         Audit Logon Events: "Success, Failure"
#     - watch_in:
#       - cmd: group-policy-update

bad_policy:
  lgpo.set:
    - computer_policy:
        Audit Credential Validation: Success and Failure
        Audit Account Management: 'Success, Failure'
        Audit Other Account Management Events: Success
        Audit User Account Management: Success and Failure
        Audit Security Group Management: Success and Failure
        Audit Account Lockout: Success
        Audit Logoff: Success
        Audit Logon Events: 'Success, Failure'
        Audit Logon: Success and Failure
        Audit Special Logon: Success
        Audit Audit Policy Change: Success and Failure
        Audit Sensitive Privilege Use: Success and Failure
        Audit Authentication Policy Change: Success and Failure
    - watch_in:
      - cmd: group-policy-update

```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Output from running "bad policy"

                          Success, Failure
                      Audit Logon Events:
                          Failure

```

**Expected behavior**
In the above case, it should have set both policies to "Success, Failure", but they ended up as just "Success".
