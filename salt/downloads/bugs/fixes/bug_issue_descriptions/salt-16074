When I try to create an instance on Azure, I get the following traceback on the `develop` branch:

```
[DEBUG   ] Tue Sep 23 22:06:33 UTC 2014
[DEBUG   ] Logging into nt-test-develop-1.cloudapp.net:22 as jenkins
[ERROR   ] Failed to create VM nt-test-develop-1. Configuration value 'has_ssh_agent' needs to be set
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1234, in create
    output = self.clouds[func](vm_)
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/cloud/clouds/msazure.py", line 632, in create
    deployed = salt.utils.cloud.deploy_script(**deploy_kwargs)
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/utils/cloud.py", line 998, in deploy_script
    elif password and kwargs['has_ssh_agent'] is False:
KeyError: 'has_ssh_agent'
Error: There was a profile error: Failed to deploy VM
```

This bug is has been introduced on `develop` and is not present on `2014.7`. I am able to create an instance successfully on `2014.7`.
