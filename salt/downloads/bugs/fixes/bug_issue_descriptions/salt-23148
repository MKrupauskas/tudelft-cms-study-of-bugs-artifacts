modules/virt.py and then runners/virt.py have the issue that if you give an invalid image location, they do not fail/complain as they should.

Assume you run a command like below, where it is [hopefully] clear that the image location is wrong:

```
salt-run virt.init ubuntu_vivid2 1 512 salt://vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.im
Searching for Hypervisors
Minion will be preseeded
Creating VM ubuntu_vivid2 on hypervisor home-bigbro
VM ubuntu_vivid2 initialized on hypervisor home-bigbro
```

Of course, no vm is created.
Salt version (master and minion): 2014.7.5; on openSuse.

Issue seems to come from modules/virt.py not saying anything about the error (if you use it inside a state, you'll get the state failed but without any other information), and runners/virt.py which does not look very well at the returned data.

I'll try to do a pull request for a fix soon.
