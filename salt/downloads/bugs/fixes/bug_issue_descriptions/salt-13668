I recently upgraded an Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) server to 14.04 (trusty). The upgrade process disables any custom repositories. However these repositories are not upgraded when provisioning.

For example, I use `ppa:chris-lea/node.js` to install the latest stable version of node.js. After the upgrade, this is the result:

```
% cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/chris-lea-node_js-saucy.list
# deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/chris-lea/node.js/ubuntu trusty main # disabled on upgrade to trusty
# deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/chris-lea/node.js/ubuntu saucy main
```

I expected pkgrepo to add `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/chris-lea-node_js-trusty.list` though, but it didn't. Digging in the source I found [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/1b2efa318b4e0b913dc2b46d4b0a117e5bf721fd/salt/modules/aptpkg.py#L1196-L1197):

> "ppa:" format can only be used to create a new repository.

So this confirms Salt does not upgrade it. My question is, why not? I've added the `dist` parameter to the state, so it is expected this works:

``` yaml
nodejs:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - ppa: chris-lea/node.js
    - dist: {{ grains['oscodename'] }}
```

If it cannot be managed this way I think it should be documented better.
