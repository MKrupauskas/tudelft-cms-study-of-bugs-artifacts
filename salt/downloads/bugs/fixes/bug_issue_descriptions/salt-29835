Hi,

I am trying to run a highstate at startup on a masterless minion, but have so far been unsuccessful. Running the highstate, or an individual state on the masterless minion works as expected, however it does not run when the minion service is restarted, or the server is rebooted.

In my minion file I have the following settings

``` yaml
startup_states: 'highstate'
file_client: local
```

and I have a `top.sls` file in `/srv/salt/` which calls my state file `start.sls` in the directory `start`.
I have tried moving the `start.sls` out of the directory, and also tried calling that directly from the minion config file using `startup_states: sls` and listing it below.

``` yaml
salt-call --versions-report
           Salt: 2015.5.5
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jul 23 2015, 05:13:40)
