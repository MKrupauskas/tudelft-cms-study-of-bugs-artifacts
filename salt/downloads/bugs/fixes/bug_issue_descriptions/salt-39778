### Description of Issue/Question
This bug is similar to  #31963. Apparently it was fixed for RPM (though I personally haven't tried it), but it seems that APT still has the same problem.
### Setup
Master and minion are Debian 8 amd64, my test case:
```
{% set codename = grains['oscodename'] %}

repository_pgdg:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
    - clean_file: True
    - name: deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ {{ codename }}-pgdg main
    - comments: 
        - 'THIS FILE IS MANAGED BY SALT! DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY!'
    - key_url: https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I've applied stated and got successfull changes (that's OK):
```
root@vostro:~# salt test state.apply repository_test
test:
----------
          ID: repository_pgdg
    Function: pkgrepo.managed
        Name: deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jessie-pgdg main
      Result: True
     Comment: Configured package repo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jessie-pgdg main'
     Started: 08:54:51.749785
    Duration: 7235.159 ms
     Changes: 
```

But after that, if I apply with `test=True`, I get changes again (shouldn't be), that "will be configured":
```
root@vostro:~# salt test state.apply repository_test test=True
test:
----------
          ID: repository_pgdg
    Function: pkgrepo.managed
        Name: deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jessie-pgdg main
      Result: None
     Comment: Package repo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ jessie-pgdg main' will be configured. This may cause pkg states to behave differently than stated if this action is repeated without test=True, due to the differences in the configured repositories.
     Started: 08:57:21.943266
    Duration: 52.8 ms
     Changes:   
```
Though if I again execute without `test=True`, I get no actual changes applied.
