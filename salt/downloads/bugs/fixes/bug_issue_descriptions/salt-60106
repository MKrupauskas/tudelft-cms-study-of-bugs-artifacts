**Description**
This reopens issue #51957 as the fix did not appear in later versions.

An AttributeError is raised accessing the name attribute of the unicode string new_name

It seems like the code in salt/spm/pkgfiles/local.py mistakenly tries to get this attribute twice in the install_file function (mirroring the pattern used to get name from the member object).

**Setup**
Install from a configured SPM

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'name'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/spm", line 11, in <module>

    return self.pkgfiles['{0}.{1}'.format(self.files_prov, func)](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/spm/pkgfiles/local.py", line 147, in install_file
    member.name = new_name.name.replace('{0}/'.format(package), '')
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'name'
```

**Expected behavior**
This should not raise an attribute error
