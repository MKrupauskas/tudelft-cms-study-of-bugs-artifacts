### Description of Issue/Question

Trying to set a hostname using `network.system`'s `hostname` doesn't work on non-RedHat/-Debian systems, e.g. Gentoo.
### Setup

Run Salt 2016.3 on Gentoo and execute:

```
salt-call state.single network.system name=set-hostname hostname=foobar apply_hostname=True
```

The result:

```
          ID: set-hostname
    Function: network.system
      Result: False

```

This is solved best by implementing native systemd support for managing hostnames which would then cover ALL distributions and would also make the existing code obsolete (though it would make sense to keep it as fallback for legacy systems).

A system in bootstrapping state (e.g. chroot or non-booted systemd-nspawn container - see also `salt.utils.systemd.booted()`) should use `systemd-firstboot --hostname="foobar"` to set the hostname.

A regularly booted system should use the [DBus interface of `systemd-hostnamed`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/hostnamed/) to manage the system's hostname.
