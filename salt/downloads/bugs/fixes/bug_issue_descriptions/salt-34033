### Description of Issue/Question

`salt-cloud` is throwing an AttributeError when trying to remove nodes defined in a map file when a profile does not exist. 
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create a map file
2. Create nodes using `salt-cloud -m <your_map>`
3. Remove all nodes using `salt-cloud -m <your_map> -d`

**Important:** using vultr as a provider but I don't think it really matters.

**Trace:**

```
> /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py(1713)delete_map()
   1712         for alias, drivers in six.iteritems(query_map.copy()):
-> 1713             for driver, vms in six.iteritems(drivers.copy()):
   1714                 for vm_name, vm_details in six.iteritems(vms.copy()):

ipdb> alias
ipdb> drivers
{'x': "No provider for the mapped 'x' profile was found. Skipped VMS: x"}
```
