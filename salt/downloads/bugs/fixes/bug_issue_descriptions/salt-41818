### Description of Issue/Question
I try to comment some lines in a FreeBSD configuration file. This file contains some comment containing itself the pattern I want to find. Result is that nothing is done.
According to documentation "comment"/"uncomment" do not have a "flags" argument, would it be relevant to add it ?

### Setup
Master(less) : Debian Stretch / virtualenv Python 2.7.13 (pip install salt-ssh) / salt-ssh 2016.11.5 (Carbon)
Minion (agentless) : FreeBSD 11.0 in virtualbox / Python 2.7.13

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
#### First
On minion : create a file /home/test_user/test.conf :
```
# Test sample
*.whatever;and_also 	 /bad/news

# Don't forget to configure /bad/news before enabling it .. 

*.error /bad/news
```
On master : create a test.sls :
```
test-comment:
  file.comment:
    - name: /home/test_user/test.conf
    - regex: ^.*/bad/news\s*
    - backup: False
```
And add it to top.sls
```
base:
  'the_minion':
    - test
```
#### Than
salt-ssh 'the_minion' state.apply

### What I get
```
salt-ssh 'the_minion' state.apply 
the_minion:
----------
          ID: test-comment
    Function: file.comment
        Name: /home/test_user/test.conf
      Result: True
     Comment: Pattern already commented
     Started: 20:11:39.976112
    Duration: 10.888 ms
     Changes:   

Summary for the_minion
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:  10.888 ms
```

But if I replace "/bad/news" by "bAd/news" in line 4 of test.conf, I get :
```
salt-ssh 'the_minion' state.apply 
the_minion:
----------
          ID: test-comment
    Function: file.comment
        Name: /home/test_user/test.conf
      Result: True
     Comment: Commented lines successfully
