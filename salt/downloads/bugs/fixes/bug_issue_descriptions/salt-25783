Hi,

Following this convert in returner(load) from postgresql_local_cache

``` python
json.dumps(unicode(str(load['return']), 'utf-8', 'replace')),
```

the `--out highstate` doesn't work as expected. 

```
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20150728103428964783 --out highstate 
app1:
return NULL, any another returner return invalid JSON.
```

Workaround is disable the convention to string.

``` python
json.dumps(load['return']), 
```

The NETAPI output from /jobs/(jid) doesn't contain the MINIONs section {}  when used postgresql_local_cache
