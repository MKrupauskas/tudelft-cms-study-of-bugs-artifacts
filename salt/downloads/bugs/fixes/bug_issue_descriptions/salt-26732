Installed 2015.5.3 via bootstrap script. `salt-call pkg.installed tmux` failed. Debug output is below. I resolved that error with `pkgin in py27-cElementTree`

Adding `py27-cElementTree` to [line 4204](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/blob/develop/bootstrap-salt.sh#L4204) of the script should fix this.
