I am spinning up a windows vm using salt-cloud. The VM works fine but there is no salt-minion installed on it. It fails with this error:

`  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/utils/cloud.py", line 1015, in wait_for_psexecsvc
    'cmd.exe', '/c hostname', host, username, password, port=port
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/utils/cloud.py", line 962, in run_psexec_command
    client = Client(host, username, password, port=port, encrypt=False, service_name=service_name)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/utils/cloud.py", line 875, in __init__
    self._client = PsExecClient(server, username, password, port, encrypt)
NameError: name 'PsExecClient' is not defined
[DEBUG   ] Retrying psexec connection to host 10.27.8.210 on port 445 (try 23)`

my config is :

```

   provider: opennebula
