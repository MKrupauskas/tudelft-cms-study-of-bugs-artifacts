Hello
Ive been unable to get the Windows salt-minion to install when launching windows openstack (private cloud) instances via salt-cloud.

Issue appears to be that salt-cloud is trying to connect on port 22 instead of smb 445, here are the log entries showing this:

```
[DEBUG   ] Deploying 10.13.102.1 at 1437382943.0 (Windows)
[DEBUG   ] Attempting connection to host 10.13.102.1 on port 22
[DEBUG   ] Caught exception in wait_for_port: [Errno 113] No route to host
```

_(linux instances work correctly)_

From what I can tell, this appears to be because I have this line in the providers config:

``` yaml
    ssh_interface: private_ips
```

This is because Im only using private IP's, no public IP's.

Without this line in the providers config, I get this error:

```
Error: There was a profile error: There are no more floating IP addresses available, please create some more
```

This error is OK, I dont have any floating public IP's available, so Im not worried about that.

Here are my provider and profile configs:

``` yaml
    # Provider
    openstack:
      # Set the location of the salt-master
      minion:
        master: somemasterserver
      # Configure the OpenStack driver
      identity_url: http://10.13.100.20:5000/v2.0/tokens
      compute_name: nova
      protocol: ipv4
      compute_region: RegionOne
      # Configure Openstack authentication credentials
      user: someuser
      password: somepass
      # tenant is the project name
      tenant: sometenant
      provider: openstack
      # skip SSL certificate validation (default false)
      insecure: false
      # added for private IPs
      ssh_interface: private_ips
```

``` yaml
    # Profile
    windows2012r2:
        provider: openstack
        size: m1.medium
        image: somewinimage
        # minion installer
        win_installer: /srv/salt/software/windows/Salt-Minion-2015.5.0-2-AMD64-Setup.exe
        win_username: somewinadmin
        win_password: somewinpass
        smb_port: 445
```

version:

``` yaml
salt --versions-report
           Salt: 2015.5.2
         Python: 2.7.5 (default, Jun 24 2015, 00:41:19)

```

```
salt-master:
CentOS Linux release 7.1.1503 (Core)
```

(running as an instance in openstack)

Steps to replicate:
1. salt / salt-master (Lithium) installed on Centos7 server
2. have openstack private cloud available (or rackspace public cloud?)
3. have 'ssh_interface: private_ips' in providers config
4. create an instance with the windows profile i.e. **salt-cloud -p windows2012r2 win01 -l debug**
5. observe DEBUG messages, and see _Attempting connection to host x.x.x.x on port 22_

I think this is a bug, please let me know if there's any more info required for this to be looked at.

Thanks
