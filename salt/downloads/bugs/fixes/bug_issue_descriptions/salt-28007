This used to work (been using it all week) but suddenly this morning on a 'pkg.upgrade refresh=True' of our development environment:

```
servername.domain.dev:
ERROR: W: Failed to fetch http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/dists/jessie/contrib/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```

And when applying the pkgrepo.managed state to new deployed minions:

```

This happens on Debian 8 VM's on multiple locations (seperate internet connections etc) so I think this issue could be on the Salt repo infra? Please let me know if I can supply any more information.
