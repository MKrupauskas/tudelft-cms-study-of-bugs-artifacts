Using a bad state name in require_in fails silently. It fails as B is running before A, A has no `foobar` state and this should be detected.

<pre>
# should fail with "Data failed to compile:"
B:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo B last
    - require_in:
      # state foobar does not exists in A
      - foobar: A

A:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo A first
</pre>
