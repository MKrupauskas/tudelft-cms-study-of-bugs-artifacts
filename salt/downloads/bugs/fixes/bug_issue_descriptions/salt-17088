`docked_onlyif` and `docked_unless` is usable to make the state idempotent.

With the following state:

```
thecommand:
  docker.run:
    - cid: container
```

`thecommand` will always be executed in the docker container.

With the following state:

```
thecommand:
  docker.run:
    - cid: container
    - docked_unless: /bin/true
```

`thecommand` will not be executed because `/bin/true` indicates the system is already converged in the desired state.

However, `docked_onlyif` disables the function `state.dockerio.run` entirely and `docked_unless` have totally no effects in the current implement.

This malfunction is caused by the bug in the function `modules.dockerio.retcode`.
`modules.dockerio.retcode` should return the return code as `int`, but it returns an instance of `dict`.
I created the minimum case to prove `modules.dockerio.retcode` returns `dict`:
