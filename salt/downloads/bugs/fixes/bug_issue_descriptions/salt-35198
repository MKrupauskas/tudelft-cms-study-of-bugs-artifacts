### Description of Issue/Question

When i use the following beacon configuration to assign a beacon configuration from pillar, the configuration is not working. However the configuration is according to the documentation.

```
beacons:
  service:
    quagga:
      onchangeonly: True
```

The message when i run "salt-minion -l warning" is as follows:

```
[CRITICAL] The beacon errored: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 2025, in handle_beacons
    beacons = self.process_beacons(self.functions)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 380, in process_beacons
    return self.beacons.process(b_conf)  # pylint: disable=no-member
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/beacons/__init__.py", line 92, in process
    raw = self.beacons[fun_str](b_config[mod])

    if not service['emitatstartup']:
