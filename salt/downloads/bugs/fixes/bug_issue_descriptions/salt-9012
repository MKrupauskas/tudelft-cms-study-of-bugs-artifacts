Hi, while a non-root user is configured in /etc/salt/master, running syndic in root user would cause this problem: master would fail to execute the commands from syndic(which is from higher master) and log a message 'Authentication failure of type "user" occurred'.

In the source code, Syndic is implemented similarly as minion: in its start() method, check_user() is called before turn_in(). In Syndic's turn_in(), it will construct a LocalClient object, which will read the root key file in cache dir(/var/cache/salt/master/.root_key in default, which access mode is set to only readable to its owner user, root) to deliver those commands from higher master.

If a non-root user is configured in /etc/salt/master, then after check_user() does setuid() to this non-root user, LocalClient would fail to read the root key file due to 'Permission denied'.

Master didn't has this issue. It could be configured to run as non-root user and started as root user in command line.
