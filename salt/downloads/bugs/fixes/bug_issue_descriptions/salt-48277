### Description of Issue/Question


This applies to a problem with the 2018.3.1 version and I have a 2nd server built identically except for having a different version of salt.  The same state files exist on each server.  Each server runs as a masterless, stand-alone minion.

I have 2 separate Virtualbox Ubuntu 18.04 VMs:  
    Server 1:  Salt 2018.3.1 installed
    Server 2:  Salt 2017.7.4 installed

I have a directory named 'common' containing an init.sls file and several sls files that are included by init.sls in the same directory.

```
common/init.sls:
     include: 
        - common.file1
        - common.file2
        - common.fille3
```

SERVER 1 & SERVER2:

I am able to run each of the included sls files individually with success

`salt-call state.sls common.file1`

However, when I call the directory for the init.sls file

`salt-call state.sls common`

it fails.

```
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** done ** 'common/init.sls'
[ERROR   ] Template was specified incorrectly: False
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Specified SLS common.file2 in saltenv base is not available on the salt master or through a configured fileserver
    Specified SLS common.file3 in saltenv base is not available on the salt master or through a configured fileserver
```
I have tried changing the order of the included states.... no difference.
I commented out all but 1 included file (I rotated which state I kept).... then it worked.

ALL of these states work without issue on SERVER 2 with salt 2017.7.4
