Hi,

I am trying to follow the instructions as mentioned here: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/rhel.html

Machine-Specs: RHEL7

Anyone else facing issue with the same instructions??

Error:
Downloading packages:
warning: /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7Server/saltstack-repo/packages/python-jinja2-2.7.2-2.el7.noarch.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID f4a80eb5: NOKEY
Retrieving key from https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/rhel7/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub

The GPG keys listed for the "SaltStack repo for RHEL/CentOS 7" repository are already installed but they are not correct for this package.
Check that the correct key URLs are configured for this repository.

 Failing package is: python-jinja2-2.7.2-2.el7.noarch
 GPG Keys are configured as: https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/rhel7/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub
