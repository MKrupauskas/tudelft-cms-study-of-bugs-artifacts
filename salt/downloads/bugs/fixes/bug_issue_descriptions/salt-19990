Hello,

Versions: 2014.7 + Softlayer cloudprovider

I've noticed that when I'm creating a cloud VM on softlayer, its key gets preseeded, it's visible with salt-key -L. My issue here is, the name of the minion is the short hostname, which in my data model represents the hardware layer (let it be physical or virtual), that is, the VM itself. Once salt is up on the minion, it will introduce itself by its FQDN, therefore the preseeded key by the short hostname is not being used.

Could it be possible to add an option to the cloud.create() for the minion's name to preseed the key as? I think this would be useful for many scenarios.
