My config like this:

demo-tools.xx.com Salt Master

demo-syndic.xx.com Salt Syndic + SaltMaster

demo-minion01.xx.com Salt Minion
demo-minion02.xx.com Salt Minion

This command works:
root@demo-tools# salt "demo-*" test.ping
demo-minion01.xx.com True
demo-minion02.xx.com True

But this one doesn't work:
root@demo-tools# salt "demo-m*" test.ping

After several hours diagnostic, I find something interesting:
1. Both demo-minion01 and demo-minion02 get the job and returned
2. salt master and salt syndic also did the job on demo-syndic 
3. demo-tools get the response as well, but it refuse to output.

Root cause is here:
With syndic configured, top level master only see syndic's pki, no other minions.

I also find the code where broke things:

On develop branch, commit 4a6baf0f07b2b2bd9d2451694ded7e94d0811852
master.py line 2433

``` python
        minions = self.ckminions.check_minions(
                clear_load['tgt'],
                clear_load.get('tgt_type', 'glob')
                )
```

In my case, minions return []

The only workaround I can try is to share pki directory for top level master and all syndics, but it may be insecure. Want to hear about your comments.

By the way, I spend more than 6 hours to go through minion/master/syndic codes and write a workflow chart to help me understand the whole process. The only doc about this is http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/topology.html, but it's much much simpler than the real world. If you have anything I can use to understand salt easily, I can help more.
