Hi,

I'm using the supervisord state and I just notice that when a task is in error state (eg: by a malformed configuration) is still shows up in the `supervisorctl status` command but with an "FATAL" message, if you want to change the configuration and restart the service saltstack will report an error.

Try to define a malformed or just a non-existing command to run in a .conf file and you will notice that once you fix the configuration saltstack will not start the tasks because the code first check for the list of tasks and our task is there but saltstack will not update it (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/supervisord.py#L64).

I don't know if the best option is to always update tasks or to add an "update" flag to the running method, or maybe check if the configuration was changed and then update in that case, or the one I like is to change line 64 to check for tasks on RUNNING state, but even in that case if I want to modify an existing and running task I need to do a manual stop.

There is also an error in the description of the module:
    restart  
        Whether to force a restart e.g. when updating a service                                                                                                                                 

restart in supervisortcl doesn't update the tasks, an update command must be explicitly run to do it, or at least a reread must be run prior to the restart. 

Bye.
