I am using reactor to then trigger and orchestration task.  The task(s) that are being ran is a bunch of saltmod commands (forgive me if that is not the right name for them).  However, when trying to specify a batch count in the saltmod, I get the following error message, "ValueError: need more than 2 values to unpack." 

Below are the relevant state files involved in this process.
```
(/etc/salt/master)
reactor:
  - 'salt/minion/*/start':
    - '/srv/reactor/startup_orchestration.sls'

(/srv/reactor/startup_orchestration.sls)
startup_orchestrate:
  runner.state.orchestrate:
    - mods: orchestration.startup
    - pillar: { target_server: {{ data.id }} }


(/srv/salt/orchestration/startup.sls)
update_loadbalancer:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'role:loadbalancer'
    - tgt_type: grain
    - batch: 1
    - sls:
      - services.loadbalancer
