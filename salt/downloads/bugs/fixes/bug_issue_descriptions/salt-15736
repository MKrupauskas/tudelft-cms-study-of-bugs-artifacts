I have the problem discussed in this old thread:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/LH6Z_iJehbw

I am running Salt from the Ubuntu Precise repository.

I defined a state with a pip package installed from a git+https URL. Each time I run highstate, I get minions trying to install a package that is already there because the version comparison fails.
I tried to use the repo option, as suggested in the linked thread, but it doesn't work and is deprecated anyway.

I can split the thing into a git state and a pip one, but I do not know how to tell pip.installed that it should install from a directory (the equivalent of pip install /my/git/repo/containing/setup.py/)
