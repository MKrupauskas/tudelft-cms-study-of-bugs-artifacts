It seems that salt-cloud cannot seperate between roles and role-instances.
Not sure if this belongs under #15958 or as a seperate issue.

When deploying a VM, salt-cloud seems to except that all cloud-services has VM's running.
If a Cloud-Service uses a Role-Instance (say eg. a Web-Service), salt-cloud stacktraces and hangs on the request.

It seems that salt-cloud cannot handle cloud-services containing role-instances, only roles (VM's).
