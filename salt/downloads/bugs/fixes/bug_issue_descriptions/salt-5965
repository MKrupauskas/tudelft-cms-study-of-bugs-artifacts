I'm trying to work around my salt-call problems by writing a new module. So I put a short python file in _modules, ran `saltutil.sync_all` for a few minions and tried to run the module, but it returned

```
web-2:
    "mrten_svn.update" is not available.
```

After a `restart salt-minion` however, I got an empty reply and in the minions' log was an error. After this, I fixed the error, ran `sync_all` again and got the same error! Only after restarting the minion again my change got picked up. 

So, the question is: do I need to restart the minions after I update a module? Because that isn't really mentioned in the manual...
