It is currently impossible to use the dockerio states or module from salt-ssh. Initial exploration in the salt-ssh uploaded shim, looks like the error is due to `six.py` masking the imports `dockerpy` tries to do of `from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlparse`

Backtrace:

``` python
  Traceback (most recent call last):

from the `/tmp/.vagrant_ccc36c__salt` temporary upload dir. 

Removing `/tmp/.vagrant_ccc36c__salt/six.py` appears to fix the issue, but probably has unintended side-effects that I haven't found yet.
