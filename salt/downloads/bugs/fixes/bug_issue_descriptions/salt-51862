### Description of Issue/Question

In 2018.3.3 icinga2 module had hardcoded wrong paths to cert files. (icinga <2.8 uses /var/lib/icinga2/certs, while older versions uses /etc/icinga2/pki).
We fixed this by hacking the icinga2.py module.

In 2018.3.4 this is supposed to be fixed.
But at least in our environment it's just broke another way...
The old icinga2.py module files hacked with correct paths still works fine (in 2018.3.4).

Master: 2018.3.4
Minion: 2018.3.4

icinga2 config state file (started from reactor after icinga2 client is installed) :
save_cert:
  icinga2.save_cert:
    - name: {{ host }}
    - master: {{ site.master }}
    - require:
        - file: make_certdir

create_nodeconfig:
  icinga2.node_setup:
    - name: {{ host }}
    - ticket: {{ ticket }}
    - master: {{ site.master }}
    - require:
      - icinga2: save_cert

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
