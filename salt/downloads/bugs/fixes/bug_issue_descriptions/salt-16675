We have some issue with salt-cloud when we create a bunch of VM (~40 VM):

we have the following error : 

```
# salt-cloud -p profile_eu_west_1a vm01.eu-west.example.com
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[INFO    ] Creating Cloud VM vm01.eu-west.example.com in eu-west-1
[INFO    ] Attempting to look up root device name for image id ami-f0b11187 on VM vm01.eu-west.example.com
[INFO    ] Found root device name: /dev/sda1
[ERROR   ] EC2 Response Status Code and Error: [400 Bad Request] {'Errors': {'Error': {'Message': "The instance ID 'i-c8XXXXXd' does not exist", 'Code': 'InvalidInstanceID.No
tFound'}}, 'RequestID': '7fc4XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXdd12'}
[WARNING ] There was an error in the query. 5 attempts remaining: {'Errors': {'Error': {'Message': "The instance ID 'i-c8XXXXXd' does not exist", 'Code': 'InvalidInstanceID.N
otFound'}}, 'RequestID': '7fc4XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXdd12'}
```

The instance is actually created with the correct instance ID. I assume the error is due to: 
- salt-cloud create EC2 VM
- salt-cloud check _just_ after with DescribeInstance, and Amazon didn't "finished" its creation

We are [here in code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/4085cfa7757ba9c7755c9f2a944ea0308c4ef50f/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py#L1674). So salt-cloud seems to expect this... but their is only 5 attempt without any delay. So in our try, we got 5 "InvalidInstanceID.NotFound" very quickly and salt-cloud failed.

I would suggest to add a time.sleep(1) before doing a new attempt. I've added such delay and VM creation successded.

For information if you want to reproduce, it seem that the error is more likely when you have "lots" of running VM (~40). The first time we run the salt-cloud --map --parallel over 40 VM, only 3 failed... but then, even few hours later (so no API call throttling) even creating one VM fail (reproduced 4 times). So amazon seems to be slower to show up newly created instance when you have a "lots" of already running VM.
