If I use `cloud.profile` instead of `cloud.present` then I have no problem. The important thing to note is if I execute the state associated with `cloud.profile` first and after that i use `cloud.present`, i do not get the error and it succeeds. 

This has happened 3-4 times and here's the result from the error i got in morning:

```
