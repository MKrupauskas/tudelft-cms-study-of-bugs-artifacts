It seems like the salt-minion only resolves the salt-master's IP once at start up. I was wondering if there's a way to get the salt-minion to re-resolve the IP when it attempts to reconnect.

I'm running salt-cloud/salt-master on my home router. The problem is my ISP rotates my public IP from time to time. While I update a public DNS record with my IPv4 address, the salt-minions don't pick it up and the master loses access to all my minions.
