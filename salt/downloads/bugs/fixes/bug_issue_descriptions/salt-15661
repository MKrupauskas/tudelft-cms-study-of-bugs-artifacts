The manpage for salt-ssh sais:
`If using --out=json, you will probably want --static as well.`

However when executed with `--static` salt-ssh throws:

`salt-ssh: error: no such option: --static`

When using salt-ssh with --out=json and without --static the resulting output is not readable by a JSON parser.
