On A fresh install of opensuse Leap 42.1 salt can't recognize the new OS

salt-call grains.items gives the following output:

```
lsb_distrib_id:
        openSUSE Leap
os:
        openSUSE Leap
    os_family:
        openSUSE Leap
    osarch:
        x86_64
    oscodename:
        x86_64
    osfullname:
        openSUSE Leap
    osrelease:
        42.1
    osrelease_info:
        - 42
        - 1
```

Relevant files in which salt should look:

/etc/os-release:

```
NAME="openSUSE Leap"
VERSION="42.1"
VERSION_ID="42.1"
PRETTY_NAME="openSUSE Leap 42.1 (x86_64)"
ID=opensuse
ANSI_COLOR="0;32"
CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:opensuse:opensuse:42.1"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.opensuse.org"
HOME_URL="https://opensuse.org/"
ID_LIKE="suse"
```

The old file salt should ignore from this release on:

/etc/SuSE-release

```
openSUSE 42.1 (x86_64)
VERSION = 42.1
CODENAME = Malachite
# /etc/SuSE-release is deprecated and will be removed in the future, use /etc/os-release instead
```
