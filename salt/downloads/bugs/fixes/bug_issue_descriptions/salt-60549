**Description**
I am trying to limit runner module args in the eauth conf, but it still allows anything to be passed in and runs the module as normal.

**Setup**
/etc/salt/master.d/eauth.conf
```
external_auth:
  pam:
    username:
      - '@runner':
        - 'test.arg':
          'kwarg1': 'kval1'
          'kwarg2': 'kval2'
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
I am trying to get this to work with **state.orch**, but to make things simple I have been testing with the **test.arg** module.
I am using curl and a JSON input file.

curl command
```
curl -Skis https://master:8000/run -H 'Content-type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/x-yaml' -d "`cat input.json`"
```
input.json
```
[
  {
    "client": "runner",
    "fun": "test.arg",
    "blah": "blah",
    "bloo": "bloo",
    "token": "(eauth token generated on master using auth.mk_token)"
  }
]
```
Return output
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/x-yaml
Server: CherryPy/18.6.0
Date: Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:49:50 GMT
Allow: GET, HEAD, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 59

return:
- args: []
  kwargs:
    blah: blah
    bloo: bloo
```

**Expected behavior**
The API call should fail with "401 Unauthorized".

**Additional context**
Each time I have made a change to the eauth.conf file I have restarted both the salt-master and salt-api services, and regenerated the eauth token.

I have tried passing just one kwarg, and none at all, and the API call always works.
