Running salt-call as non-root user gives exception (that seems to loop forever):
1. login to a machine running salt-minion 2015.8.3
2. as a non-root user type, for example: `salt-call pkg.install`
3. exception (have to hit ^C a half dozen times to exit out of the exception)
4. however, if sudo is added: `sudo salt-call pkg.install` there is no exception

Any gibberish can be typed following `salt-call` and the same results will happen

Here is a snippet of the exception:

```
Exception ValueError: 'I/O operation on closed file' in <bound method SyncWrapper.__del__ of <salt.utils.async.SyncWrapper object at 0x1a3f690>> ignored
Exception ValueError: 'I/O operation on closed file' in <bound method SyncWrapper.__del__ of <salt.utils.async.SyncWrapper object at 0x1a3f690>> ignored
Exception ValueError: 'I/O operation on closed file' in <bound method SyncWrapper.__del__ of <salt.utils.async.SyncWrapper object at 0x1a3f690>> ignored

Exception ValueError: 'I/O operation on closed file' in <bound method SyncWrapper.__del__ of <salt.utils.async.SyncWrapper object at 0x1a3f690>> ignored
```

Seems to be non-OS specific as we duplicated on a few different OS's.

Below is the salt version output on one of the minions:
