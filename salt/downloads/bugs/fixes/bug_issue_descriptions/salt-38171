### Description of Issue/Question
Hello,

The file.line with mode=ensure doesn't seem to be working as it should. I'm trying to ensure that a line is present in a file after another line. However, the regex for after or before don't seem to be working and also using location=end doesn't work as documented.

Thanks in advance.

### Setup
Configuration file:
```
key1=value1
key2=value2
.
key4=value4,key=value, paramx
.
key=value    # This is the line after which I want my new line added
.
.
.
keyn=valuen

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running the following on the master:

```bash
salt 'minion' file.line /path/to/configfile mode="ensure" content="mykey=myval" after="^key=value$"
```
Gives the following result:

```
ERROR: Found less than expected occurrences in "after" expression
```
On removing the end of line character ```$```, I can get matches but salt complains about having more than expected number of matches. I can work around the ```$``` by using ```key=value(\n|\r|\\r\n)``` but it will still match lines which don't start with key. 

Also, as per the documentation, location takes precedence over before and after. So, if I use the following:

```bash
salt 'minion' file.line /path/to/configfile mode="ensure" content="mykey=myval" location="end"
```
I get the following error:

```
ERROR: Wrong conditions? Unable to ensure line without knowing where to put it before and/or after.
```
I can't use file.manged because files like the grub menu usually get updated when new kernels are installed.
