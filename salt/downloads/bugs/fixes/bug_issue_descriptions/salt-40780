### Description of Issue/Question
Running the following will always result in a test=True returning a change will happen. When running the states without test=True, they correctly show that nothing happened.
```
$ systemctl status ossec-agent
 ossec-agent.service - OSSEC agent
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ossec-agent.service; static; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2017-04-19 20:23:49 UTC; 22min ago
 Main PID: 26469 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

but it was already disabled..?
```
----------
          ID: disable ossec-service-agent
    Function: service.disabled
        Name: ossec-agent
      Result: None
     Comment: Service ossec-agent set to be disabled
     Started: 20:38:43.265890
    Duration: 9.93 ms
     Changes:   
```

### Setup
```
some_state_name_1:
  service.dead:
    - name: ossec-agent.service
    - enabled: False

some_state_name_2:
  service.disabled:
    - name: ossec-agent.service
```

This however, correctly states that no changes will happen during test=True if the service is dead.
```
pls_be_dead:
  service.dead:
    - name: ossec-agent.service
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set any systemd unit file to service.dead, service.dead enabled: False, or service.disabled, run the state a few times, then run a test=True to see that you will have changes.
