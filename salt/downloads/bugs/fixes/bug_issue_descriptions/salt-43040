### Description of Issue/Question
From documentation, when using git with ext_pillars, one should be able to use `__env__` instead of directly specifying a branch name.  This should result in the master trying to use the git branch matching with the pillarenv or environment on the minion. This seems to be broken because currently it results in empty pillars on the minion.

### Setup
/etc/salt/master
```
fileserver_backend:
  - git

gitfs_remotes:
  - file:///root/myrepo.git

gitfs_root: states/ 

ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - __env__ file:///root/myrepo.git:
        - root: pillars/

top_file_merging_strategy: same

pillar_source_merging_strategy: none

state_top_saltenv: base
````

/root/myrepo.git is a simple local git repository and is attached to this issue as a tar.gz archive. This respository contains 2 branches: master and branch1
```
# git branch
  branch1
* master
```

The only difference between the master and branch1 branches are the content of the file pillars/data.sls as follows:

```
# git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

# cat pillars/data.sls 
from: MASTER

# git checkout branch1
Switched to branch 'branch1'

# cat pillars/data.sls 
from: branch1
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On minion:
```
salt-call pillar.items  
local:
    ----------
    from:
        MASTER

```
which is as expected. However if we try to pass a specific pillarenv we get a set of empty pillars:
```
# salt-call pillar.items pillarenv=branch1
local:
    ----------
```

We expect the actual pillars from branch1 when pillarenv=branch1.
