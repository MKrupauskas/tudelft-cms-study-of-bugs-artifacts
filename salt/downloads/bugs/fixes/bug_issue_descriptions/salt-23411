I think we should be able to append values to a list at any level of a grain. Don't you?

An example:
Provided this grain:

``` yaml
list:
  - val1
  - val2
```

The command `salt-call grains.append 'list' 'val3'` will update the grain to:

``` yaml
list:
  - val1
  - val2
  - val3
```

With this grain, however:

``` yaml
mygrain:
  var: somevalue
  list:
    - val1
    - val2
```

the command `salt-call grains.append 'mygrain:list' 'val3'` will give that output, which is correct, IMO:

``` yaml
mygrain:list:
  - val1
  - val2
  - val3
```

but the grain `mygrain` is still:

``` yaml
mygrain:
  var: somevalue
  list:
    - val1
    - val2
```

EDIT: Actually, there is a new grain `mygrain:list`, containing the complete list. This is weird:

``` console
$ salt-call grains.get 'mygrain:list'
local:
    - val1
    - val2
$ salt-call grains.item 'mygrain:list'
local:
    - val1
    - val2
    - val3
```
