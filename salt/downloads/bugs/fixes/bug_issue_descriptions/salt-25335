Doesn't seem to be OS Specific.
Verified on the following OS's:
Windows 2012R264
Ubuntu 14.04

To reproduce:
Install salt-minion 2015.5.3
Make sure `master_type` is set to `str`
Try to start the minion
It will fail with the following in the debug:

```
salt-minion -l debug
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Including configuration from '/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf'
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Setting up the Salt Minion "test_cent_minion_install"
[DEBUG   ] Created pidfile: /var/run/salt-minion.pid
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Including configuration from '/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf'
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf
[ERROR   ] Invalid keyword 'str' for variable 'master_type'
[INFO    ] The salt minion is shut down
```

Previous versions of the minion work just fine with this setting, in fact it appears to be the default.

If you delete the entry from the minion conf and let it choose a default, it actually starts successfully. It shows master_type as `standard` as shown by the config.option master_type command.

This problem was discovered while trying to spin up a Windows VM on EC2 and push a minion to it. It all installed successfully but failed to start. The reason it failed to start is because salt-cloud pushes out a default configuration that includes this setting.
