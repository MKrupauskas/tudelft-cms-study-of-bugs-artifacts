Salt cannot install an IPv6 default route on RedHat-derived systems.  That is, a route with an "ipaddr" of "::/0".  The IPv6 route is rendered into route-`<interface>` instead of route6-`<interface>`.
### Setup

The following SLS file named 'dflt.sls' is applied with "salt nodename state.apply dflt"

```
network.routes:
  network.routes:
  - name: eth0
  - routes:
    - name: dflt
      ipaddr: ::/0
      gateway: 2001:4878:c034:340::1
      prefix: 64
```

The IPv6 default route configuration is rendered correctly, but it is put into route-eth0 instead of route6-eth0, which fails to install the route.

The reason is that utils/validate/net.py:__ip_addr() rejects a netmask of zero, and modules/rh_ip.py:build_routes() checks whether route['ipaddr'] is a valid ipv6 address or not.  Not IPv6 means put it in the IPv4 list.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Configure a static default IPv6 route as above.  The route configuration information will be put into /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-`<interface>` instead of route6-`<interface>`
