Given a mapfile already provisionned using the command line (salt-cloud -m <mapfile> -y), when I try the following with the Python API:

```
> import salt.cloud
> s = salt.cloud.CloudClient('/etc/salt/cloud')
> s.map_run('<mapfile>')
```

I get the following log and stacktrace on Salt 2015.8.1:

```
> The 'vmware' cloud drive is unable to be optimized.
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
>   File "[...]/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 351, in map_run
>     dmap = mapper.map_data()
>   File "[...]/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1877, in map_data
>     matching = get_matching_by_name(name)
>   File "[...]/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1866, in get_matching_by_name
>     matches[driver] = details['state']
> TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

I have absolutely no idea why I'm getting this, so I cannot propose a solution. It's definitely not expected.
