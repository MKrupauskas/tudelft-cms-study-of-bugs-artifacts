I am trying to pull the IP from one of my interfaces. 

I didn't have any luck with network.interfaces, so I'm trying powershell.  However the syntax inside pillars has me stumped.

I created a script and tried referencing the powershell file within pillars using cmd.script, but no luck on that either.

Which leads me to finally ask does powershell work within pillars?
