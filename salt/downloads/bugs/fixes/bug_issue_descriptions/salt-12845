On FreeBSD, invoking the "zfs" command causes the kernel to load the "zfs.ko" and "opensolaris.ko" kernel modules (if they aren't already).  Because salt.modules.zfs dynamically generates functions based on the output of "zfs help", running the Salt minion on FreeBSD will cause ZFS support to be automatically loaded even if the system administrator has not configured ZFS.  Furthermore, each invocation of "zfs help" is logged by the minion, and the command output is included when debug logging is enabled.

Right now, this only violates POLA and slightly complicates debug output, but I could imagine situations where unexpectedly autoloading kernel modules could cause problems for the unwary sysadmin.
