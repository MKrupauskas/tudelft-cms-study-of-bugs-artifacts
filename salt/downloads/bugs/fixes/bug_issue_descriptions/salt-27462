Using version `2015.8.0` 

If the given URL results in a redirection (30X) and the redirection response includes a non empty body, this body will be included in the resulting downloaded file.

I came across this when using `states.archive.extracted`, using a github url (in `source`) in the form of
`https://github.com/MY-ORG/MY-REPO/archive/master.zip` which in turn will redirect to 
`https://codeload.github.com/MY-ORG/MY-REPO/zip/master`
In addition, github will add the following body to the redirection response

```
<html><body>You are being <a href="https://codeload.github.com/MY-ORG/MY-REPO/zip/master">redirected</a>.</body></html>
```

The end result was that the downloaded file included this body in the prefix of the downloaded zip file, resulting in a malformed zip file.

A self contained reproduction:

`server.py` (`pip install bottle` is required)

``` python
from bottle import *

@route('/one')
def one():
    try:
        redirect('/two')
    except HTTPResponse as e:
        e.body = 'redirect|'
        raise

@route('/two')
def two():
    return 'two'

run()
```
1. `python server.py`
2. `salt-call cp.get_url http://localhost:8080/one $PWD/one`
3. `cat one` prints `redirect|two`
