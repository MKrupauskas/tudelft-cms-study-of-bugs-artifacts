### Description of Issue
When installing salt from the bdist_wheel package it returns the wrong version when the tag includes a minor version. You can quickly replicate this by creating a tag and pushing it up to your personal repo and running the bootstrap:

```
wget -O bootstrap.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sh bootstrap.sh -g https://github.com/ch3ll/salt.git -M -P git v3000.1
```

```
[root@ch3ll ~]# salt --version
salt 3000
```

The reason this is occurring is because we do not include the `_version.py` file when we build the wheel package.
