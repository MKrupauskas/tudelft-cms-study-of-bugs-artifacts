### Description of Issue/Question
Running `file.copy` with `preserve: True` does not preserve ownership (resets to root/user under which salt is running). The access permissions are preserved, though.

### Setup
On master:

```
# cat /srv/salt/copy.sls
/file_target:
  file.copy:
    - source: /file_source
    - preserve: True
```

On minion:
```
# ls -l /file_source
-rwx-w--wt 1 mysql mysql 0 Mar 20 15:17 /file_source*
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On master:
```
# salt 'minion' state.apply copy
```

On minion:
```
# ls -l /file_target
-rwx-w--wt 1 root root 0 Mar 20 15:34 /file_target*
```
