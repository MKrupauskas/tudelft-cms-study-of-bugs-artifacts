I have a grain hierarchy and wrote python grains of the form:

``` python
# file 1
def get_grains() :
  return {'a': {'b': 'vb'}}

# file 2
def get_grains() :
  return {'a': {'c': 'vc'}}
```

I was expecting a final grain dict like so:

``` python
{'a': {'b': 'vb', 'c': 'vc'}}
```

What happens instead is that one of the grains wins and clobbers the other.
It seems to me that common keys should be merged.
