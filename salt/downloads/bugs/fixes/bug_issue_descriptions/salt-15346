I just had my master crash and stop working. A restart of the process seems to have brought it back on track. I'm afraid I can't recreate the issue, but here's a stacktrace from the master log:

```
2014-08-27 15:53:51,382 [salt.master      ][ERROR   ] Error in function _return:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/master.py", line 1701, in run_func
    ret = getattr(self, func)(load)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/master.py", line 1371, in _return
    self.event.fire_event(load, tagify([load['jid'], 'ret', load['id']], 'job'))
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/utils/event.py", line 326, in fire_event
    event = '{0}{1}{2}'.format(tag, tagend, self.serial.dumps(data))
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/payload.py", line 125, in dumps
    return msgpack.dumps(msg)
  File "_msgpack.pyx", line 169, in msgpack._msgpack.packb (msgpack/_msgpack.c:2384)
SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
```

Feel free to close this issue if the stacktrace isn't enough.
