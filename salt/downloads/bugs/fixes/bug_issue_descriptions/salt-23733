We have multilevel syndics and running 201502 branch. (Guess i will need to update to 201505 branch) 
For some pattern matching, the results are returned properly but sometimes it doesnt. 

on a minion: 

``` yaml
local:
    ----------
    fun:
        publish.publish
    fun_args:
        - somename.*
        - cmd.run
        - w
        - expr_form=pcre
    id:
        someservername
    jid:
        20150514202752109911
    retcode:
        0
    return:
        None
```

on the targetted minion: in the minion log 

```
2015-05-14 20:27:52,215 [salt.minion                              ][INFO    ][64791] Starting a new job with PID 64791
2015-05-14 20:27:52,223 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod            ][INFO    ][64791] Executing command 'w' in directory '/root'
2015-05-14 20:27:52,264 [salt.minion                              ][INFO    ][64791] Returning information for job: 20150514202752140585
```

So the jobs are getting to the tagetted minions with different JID (is this normal?) Is there a like jid table on the master to match the jid it sent and received initially by a minion? 
So on the minion that published, i see no result other than above using --metadata 

The other thing to note is that, should the executing user be root on the targetted minion as opposed to the euid?
