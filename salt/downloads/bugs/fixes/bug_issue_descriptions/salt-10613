When SSH targets are unable to authenticate using public key or other supported means the authentication becomes interactive (using sshpass).  If there are several additional SSH targets that automatically connect then the return information "noise" from the successful connections causes the interactive password connection to be "lost".  Additionally the SSH connection never times out because the current timeout only applies to the SSH connection completing (which it has, it just has not authenticated).

This is helped by #10609, but there are a few additional problems that still need to be addressed:
- possibly collecting the failed SSH authentications and letting them be addressed.
- putting the TTY back in sane mode (the interactive authentication disables echo to the terminal)

I do not have a patch but will create one once feedback and suggestions are provided.
