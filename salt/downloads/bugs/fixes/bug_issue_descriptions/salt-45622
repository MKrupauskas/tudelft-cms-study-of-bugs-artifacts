### Description of Issue/Question
Using win_path.exists with index 0 adds the path at the end instead of at the beginning. The index is just ignored.
Index 1 adds it at the second position (as expected) so it's impossible to add a path at the beginning.

### Setup
```
test path:
  win_path.exists:
    - name: 'C:\Program Files\test\'
    - index: 0
```
Applied on Windows 10.0.16299

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply the state above:
Result:
```        
   ID: test path
    Function: win_path.exists
     Name: C:\Program Files\test\
      Result: True
