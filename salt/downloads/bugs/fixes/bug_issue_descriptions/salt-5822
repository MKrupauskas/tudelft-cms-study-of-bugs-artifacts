A component of this commit, [e842594](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/e842594a7df4d4528fdddde65a4538d0f4fcc884), goes somewhat against Gentoo best practices. Inclusion of --with-bdeps=y should be managed by the user via the make.conf var EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS and/or via the cli. Further, the use of --complete-graph is generally recommended for world updates. Using --with-bdeps=y together with --complete-graph makes the graph as complete as possible. However, from the long-time maintainer of portage, zmedico, "--with-bdeps=y should never be required".

The reason is that it can easily cause breakage in packages dependent on some newly updated bdep. Some packages are more sensitive to changes than others.

Further,  --complete-graph is always good but can waste time for some small calculations. These days, --complete-graph is enabled automatically be default when necessary, via --complete-graph-if-new-use and --complete-graph-if-new-ver which is handy.

In my view, leaving --with-bdep=y out is the safe option, where the user can decide what is needed though managing EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS or invoke emerge directly via cmd.run with any option they wish.
