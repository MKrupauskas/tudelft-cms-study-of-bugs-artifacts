Using the ssh_known_hosts.present in a state file.

http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/v2014.1.1/ref/states/all/salt.states.ssh_known_hosts.html?highlight=known_hosts#salt.states.ssh_known_hosts.present

Here is the state file.

Expectation is that the function behave like file.append:
1. check the known_hosts file for the public key.
2. If public key is found, then do nothing.
3. if the public key is not found,  then append the public key to the file.

However, instead the function appends the public key no matter what. This means that the public key is appended to the known_hosts file after each state run, regardless of whether the entry is already there. As a consequence, the known_hosts file is filled with multiple entries, where each entry is of the same public key.
