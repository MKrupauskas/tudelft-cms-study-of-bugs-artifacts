I'm using the very latest Salt from the develop branch and I updated to the latest bootstrap script with `salt-cloud -u`. I have attempted multiple times to spin up a new Ubuntu 14.04 vm with Salt-Cloud on DigitalOcean without success.

Salt-Cloud does spin up the vm just fine, but appears to not be able to ssh in. It might be that Salt-Cloud is trying too early and is failing, because if I use the exact connection string, I can ssh in just fine to the new vm.

Here's the output:

```
root@boucha:~/salt# time salt-cloud -p do_512_git davetest03

```

Then I connect with the same command:

```
