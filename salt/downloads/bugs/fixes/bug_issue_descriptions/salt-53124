### Description of Issue/Question
State fails with this KeyError:
`KeyError: u'ssh.set_auth_key`. It seems as described [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/releases/2019.2.0.html) that Jinja will render the unicode string types with a "u" prefix.
Any idea how can I solve?
Thanks to everybody for the support
