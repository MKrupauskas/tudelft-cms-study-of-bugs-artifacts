I was wrapping some salt-key calls in a bash script that signs/revokes keys in my environment when we spin up new instances in EC2, and when it tried to sign a key that hadn't been submitted to the master yet, `salt-key` exited 0, even though the key hadn't been submitted. I expected salt-key to exit non-zero when it couldn't find a key.
