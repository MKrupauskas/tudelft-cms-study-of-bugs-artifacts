I have the following states that apply to a group of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS servers:

```
timey-wimey:
  pkg.latest:
    - pkgs:
      - ntp
      - tzdata
  service.running:
    - name: ntp
    - require:
      - pkg: timey-wimey


system_timezone:
  timezone.system:
    - name: {{ pillar['time']['timezone'] }}
    - utc: True
```

When the state is applied to those servers, it says it ran successfully and I can verify with timezone.get_zone.  However, whenever I run the highstate, it says that it still needs to be set.  After doing some digging with the help from someone on Freenode, I noticed that the /etc/adjtime file had 'LOCAL' set instead of 'UTC'.  After sed'ing the file, the highstate output displays correctly the server is already set to UTC time.

@babilen tracked it down to this:
