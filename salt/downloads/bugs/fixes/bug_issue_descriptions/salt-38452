### Description of Issue/Question

If you use `file.line` with `mode: delete`, if a successful deletion occurs, the ownership of the file is not preserved (but changes to root:root)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use `file.line` with `mode: delete` in a state file, and set it up to successfully delete at least one line in a file on the minion that is not owned by root. After the state has run, you will see that the file is now chowned root:root.

### Versions Report

2016.11.1 on both master and minion.
