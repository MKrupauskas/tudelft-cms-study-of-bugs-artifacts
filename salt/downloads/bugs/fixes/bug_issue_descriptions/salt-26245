Salt [v2015.5.3 gitfs docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/gitfs.html) state that we need pygit2 0.20.3 as a minimum version. 

It appears that salt v2015.5.3 gitfs.py is using pygit2.errors - which doesn't appear until pygit2 0.21.0. This causes errors such as as this for those not up to pygit2 0.21.0 when there are problems with gitfs:

```
[DEBUG   ] Set lock for git@github.com:bradthurber/salt-formula.git
[DEBUG   ] gitfs is fetching from git@github.com:bradthurber/salt-formula.git
[ERROR   ] Exception ''module' object has no attribute 'errors'' caught while fetching gitfs remote git@github.com:bradthurber/salt-formula.git
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/fileserver/gitfs.py", line 1162, in update
    except pygit2.errors.GitError as exc:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'errors'
```

It looks like the requirement for pygit2.errors.GitError was removed at some point in salt develop. Possible fix options for 2015.5:
a) Update the gitfs doc page to state pygit2 0.21.0 is the minimum version required 
b) backport portions of salt develop gitfs.py to avoid use of pygit2.errors.GetError.
