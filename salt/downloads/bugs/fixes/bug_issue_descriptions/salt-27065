I was running a highstate and noticed this message in the output. I'm not quite sure which state in the highstate generated the message, but since the message asks to report it... Looks like the message comes from [this part of the code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blame/2015.8/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L87).
