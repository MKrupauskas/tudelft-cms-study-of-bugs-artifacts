I executed the dsc.apply_config execution function, passing in a valid directory on the endpoint, but one that does not contain any .mof files (the mof actually existed in a subdirectory of this one named appsense).  This resulted in the master just hanging there processing the job.  No errors or anything; it just hangs there indefinitely.

When I looked into the log, I can see the command process, but it appears it’s in an infinite loop.  If you execute the start-dscconfiguration command in powershell, but pass it a directory that doesn’t contain any valid mof files for the host, it throws an exception.  It appears that this scenario in salt results in an infinite do loop since $job.state is $null and never matches the clauses in the ‘while’ statement.
