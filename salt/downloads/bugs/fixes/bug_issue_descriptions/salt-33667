Testing the following state on Windows incorrectly reports that the file contents will be changed, showing a diff indicating that all lines will be re-written. Testing the same state on Linux works as documented, returning no changes. Actually applying the state on Windows correctly returns no changes.

<pre>{% if grains['os'] == 'Windows' %}
  {% set test_file = 'C:\\test.txt' %}
{% else %}
  {% set test_file = '/test' %}
{% endif %}
