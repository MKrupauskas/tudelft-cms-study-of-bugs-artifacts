`salt-cloud -p <azure-profile> <minion-name>` was working quite well in 2014.7.0, but when running the same command with the exact same provider and profile files, I am not able to provision a VM with azure. 

It gets through the cloud-service creation step as well as creating the VM. It also installs salt, but fails somewhere quickly thereafter. Here's the final information:

```
[INFO    ] Salt installed on nt-azure-test-3
Error: There was a profile error: Cannot deploy salt in a VM if the 'ssh_keyfile' setting is not set and there is no password set for the vm. Check your provider for the 'change_password' option.
```

Did something in the setup change from 2014.7.0 to 2015.2? I ran this with `-l debug` but that was all of the information that was given in the final moments, so I don't have anything else to show really.

@traxair I think you and @techhat have been in this code most recently. Any thoughts?
