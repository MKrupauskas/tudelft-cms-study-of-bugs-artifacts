@thatch45, @SmithSamuelM , As Salt Helium will come soon, I hope that the salt-raet beta support queue management ( such  as find\clear\watch etc.) and raet event listen ( I have already tried to get salt-raet event by iter_events in raetevent.py, but failed with errors likes #13966 said..).

BTW, salt raet seems work slowly than salt zeromq, is it normal or could be improved?
Salt raet is awesome, wishes it better! Thks.
