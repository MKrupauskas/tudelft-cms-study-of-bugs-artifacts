Upgrading from salt 2015.5.3 (Lithium) to 2015.8.0 (Beryllium) fails on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-44-generic x86_64) due to unmet python-tornado dependency. 

First, trying to install salt-master fails:

```
apt-get install salt-master
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 salt-master : Depends: salt-common (= 2015.8.0+ds-1) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

Then, trying to install salt-common fails:

```
apt-get install salt-common=2015.8.0+ds-1
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 salt-common : Depends: python-tornado (>= 4.2.1) but it is not going to be installed
               Recommends: python-mako but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

The version of python-tornado required is not available on apt, and installing via pip does not seem to be a good idea. However, the deb package for tornado can be found on your repo (http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/ubuntu14/pool/main/p/python-tornado/) so as a temporary workaround was added to our repo and installed via apt. 

Since tornado is considered experimental for this release according to the release notes, it should not block installation.
