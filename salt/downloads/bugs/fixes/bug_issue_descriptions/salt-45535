### Description of Issue/Question

The `module_dirs` is not copied from the master opts into salt-ssh opts which causes modules and pillars left out of the transfer. 

### Setup

The most straightforward test is a custom pillar in a module_dirs directory. 

I put this pillar file in /srv/salt/extmods/pillar/test.py
```
__virtualname__ = 'test_pillars'

def __virtual__():
  return __virtualname__

def ext_pillar( minion_id, pillar, *args, **kwargs ):

    my_pillar = {'external_pillar': 'test'}


    return my_pillar
```
and configured my master with these settings
```
ext_pillar:
  - test_pillars: []

module_dirs:
  - /srv/salt/extmods
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
see above setup and then run `salt-ssh <minion> pillar.items`

the result will be 
```
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad test_pillars.ext_pillar: 'test_pillars.ext_pillar' is not available.
[CRITICAL] Specified ext_pillar interface test_pillars is unavailable
```

### Versions Report
I started testing this in 2016.11.7. However, I have moved up to see if this was fixed in any version.

### Possable fix?

In testing this I did find that if add these two lines into `salt/client/ssh/__init__.py` around line 913 it works, but am unsure if that is the direction that we want to pursue. 
```
            if 'module_dirs' in self.opts:
                opts_pkg['module_dirs'] = self.opts['module_dirs']
```
