master.py is doing a boolean check on `self.opts['discovery']`, and assuming discovery is enabled if it resolves to `True`. But because there is a default value in `salt/config/__init__.py`, this option is therefore assumed to be enabled out-of-the-box. This doesn't seem correct, the description in the release notes mentions nothing about this feature being enabled by default, and doing so would add a hard dependency in Python 2, which I don't think was intended.

It looks like the best course of action is to set `discovery` to `False` so that it is not enabled by default.

Also, the types in [this block of code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/990c628/salt/config/__init__.py#L1165-L1182) can be removed, since `_validate_opts()` doesn't do type checking on sub-keys of a dict, and therefore these options are never going to be checked.
