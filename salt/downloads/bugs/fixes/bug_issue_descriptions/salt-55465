### Description of Issue

We realized that if one tries to use the nftable module, some functions try to access a 'default' nftables config file that is `/etc/nftables` if no file parameter was passed.
This failes with an error message that tells you that it tried to open the file but found an directory instead.
That is because this file does not exist on RHEL7 or 8 but instead is a directory that contains multiple config files, sorted by table family and chains. All these files are then hard included in the `/etc/nftables/all-in-one.nft', so overall there is no default nftables config on RHEL7 or RHEL8.

Because of this I don't know if this is easily "fixable" on RHEL and now that nftables slowly starts to replace iptables, other distros might also start to implement their own idea of a basic nftables config file structure that might clash with this default behaviour.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
try following commands on a RHEL minion with nftables:
(Tested with Fedora, CentOS7 and CentOS8)

`salt test12 nftables.get_saved_rules`
or
`salt test12 nftables.save`
