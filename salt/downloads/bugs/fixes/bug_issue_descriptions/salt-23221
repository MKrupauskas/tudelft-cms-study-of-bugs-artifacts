Hi, 

I think like in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/13295 

the state definition

```
de_DE.UTF-8:
    locale.present

en_GB.UTF-8:
    locale.present

en_US.UTF-8:
    locale.present
```

failed to setup:

```

```

It seems that its not opend in file correctly:

```
# grep -v -e ^# -e ^$ /etc/locale.gen
#
```

When I edit/activate it manually:

```
# grep -v -e ^# -e ^$ /etc/locale.gen 
de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
# locale-gen 
Generating locales (this might take a while)...
  de_DE.UTF-8... done
  en_GB.UTF-8... done
  en_US.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
```

the state is correctly recognized as already setup.
