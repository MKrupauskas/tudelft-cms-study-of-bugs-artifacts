### Description of Issue/Question

Grain `virtual_subtype` is detected as 'Xen PV DomU' (para-virtualized) on HVM (on Amazon EC2 instances). It should be detected as HVM, obviously.

The [core.py](http://fossies.org/linux/salt/salt/grains/core.py) shows the logic of it, and I can't see the bug. Grains.items does show the productname as 'HVM domU', so the check on line 723 should make it 'HVM domU'.

The VM does have `/proc/xen`. It does not have `/proc/xen/xsd_kva`. It then gets to `grains.get('productname', '') == 'HVM domU'`, which should pass. The `_hw_data` is also called before `_virtual`, so `productname` should be available.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt <hostname> grains.items` on Xen HVM (amazon EC2 instance of Ubuntu 14.04 in my case).
