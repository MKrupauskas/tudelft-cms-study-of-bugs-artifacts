### Description of Issue/Question

`pkgrepo.managed -ppa` does not create the repo if the file exists with the right line, but the line is commented out.

`apt-add-repository` does that successfully but it seems, if I correctly understand the [code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/aptpkg.py), that this command is not called.

One way the line will be commented out is by upgrading the system with `do-release-upgrade`, but if the line is commented out, it means the repo is not configured anyway.

It is related to #13668, but `do-release-upgrade` now upgrade the repository in addition to commenting it out, so the workaround can no longer be used (and pkgrepo now takes oscodename into account in 2016.11.2).

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

```
# cat test-repo.sls
rsyslog install:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - ppa: adiscon/v8-stable

# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adiscon-ubuntu-v8-stable-xenial.list
#deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/adiscon/v8-stable/ubuntu xenial main
# deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/adiscon/v8-stable/ubuntu xenial main
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Applying the state does not install the repository. Changing the relevant line after the comment mark in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/adiscon-ubuntu-v8-stable-xenial.list` like this for example:
```
#deb ://ppa.launchpad.net/adiscon/v8-stable/ubuntu xenial main
# deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/adiscon/v8-stable/ubuntu xenial main
```

works as expected.
