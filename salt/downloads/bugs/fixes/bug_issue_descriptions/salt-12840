I'm running salt 2014.1.3 (I cant use 2014.1.4 because of https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/12699).  I've got a simple state that deploys a war file to a local tomcat server like so:

```
MyApp:
  tomcat:
    - war_deployed
    - name: /MyApp
    - war: salt://workspace/myapp/target/Myapp-1.0.0.war
```

When I attempt to deploy it after that version is already deployed, I get an output like this from `salt-call -l debug state.sls myapp` , which is as expected:

```
[DEBUG   ] Loaded no_out as virtual quiet
[DEBUG   ] Loaded json_out as virtual json
[DEBUG   ] Loaded yaml_out as virtual yaml
[DEBUG   ] Loaded pprint_out as virtual pprint
local:
----------
          ID: MyApp
    Function: tomcat.war_deployed
        Name: /MyApp
      Result: True
     Comment: /MyApp in version MyApp-1.0.0 is already deployed
     Changes:   

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0

Total:     1
```

However, when I do a fresh deploy, theres a python error and the output goes from the well formatted "highstate" style, to a very ugly "pprint" style:

```

                          version:
                              MyApp-1.0.0
                      name:
                          /MyApp
                      result:
                          True
```

This happens even when I invoke the state with  "--out=highstate".
