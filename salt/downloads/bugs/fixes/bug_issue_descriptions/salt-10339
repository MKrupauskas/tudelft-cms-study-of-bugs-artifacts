When restarting a service salt seems to be manually looking for and running an init.d script if present. Expected behavior on Ubuntu and Debian is to call the normal init system via 'service foo restart'. On Ubuntu this prefers an upstart config if present over an init.d script, while salt ends up using the init script even if the upstart config is present.
