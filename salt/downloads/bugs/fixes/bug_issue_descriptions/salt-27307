739b2ef introduced a regression by changing this function to passing a
list of arguments. The regression was also partly caused by requiring
the user to pass the yum CLI arguments for enabling and disabling repos
manually. So if someone passed multiple values for the repo argument
(e.g. repo='--disablerepo="*" --enablerepo=anotherrepo') then these
would both end up in the same list element, which would cause the yum
command to fail as they would be expected by yum to be a single argument
instead of separate arguments.
