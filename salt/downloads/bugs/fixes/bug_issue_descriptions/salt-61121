**Description**
A pair of states (One extending another) works with minion up to 3003, but not with 3004. Instead I get:

````
salt-call state.apply rsyslog test=True
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Cannot extend ID 'rsyslog' in 'base:services.rsyslog'. It is not part of the high state.
This is likely due to a missing include statement or an incorrectly typed ID.
Ensure that a state with an ID of 'rsyslog' is available
in environment 'base' and to SLS 'services.rsyslog'
````

**Setup**

Salt master (happens with both 3000.3 and 3004 tested).
Two states:
packages.rsyslog:
````
rsyslog:
  pkg:
    - latest
````

services.rsyslog:
````
include:
  - packages.rsyslog

extend:
  rsyslog:
    service:
     - running
     - enable: True
     - require:
       - pkg: rsyslog
     - watch:
       - pkg: rsyslog
`````
(could be simplified, but it worked for years now)
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
run `salt-call state.apply services.rsyslog` (or highstate including it) on salt-minion 3004.
Works fine with older minions.

**Expected behavior**
both pkg.installed and service.running including require and watch should work as before.
