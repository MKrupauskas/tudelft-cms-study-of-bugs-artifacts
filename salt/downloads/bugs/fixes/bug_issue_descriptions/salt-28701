When a minion key is removed, the mine data is not purged.

Example:

Delete the minion key, run a mine.get and the mine data for that specific minion is not there.
However when creating a new system with the same minion id but for example a different ip address, the old mine data (old ip address) will be displayed when use mine.get.
The old data will not be purge until mine.flush is executed.
