Minions seem to randomly drop their connection to the master. My minions are Windows but other (admittedly anecdotal) sources also mention this with Linux minions. As one data point, here is a note from OpenCredo.com:

_The only real problem I found was that connections between the salt-master and a minion would sometimes go AWOL. A read around the web told me that others have experienced it too in this particular version of Salt (0.10.5)._

Not sure were to start for this, but dropped minion connections is a daily thing for us.
