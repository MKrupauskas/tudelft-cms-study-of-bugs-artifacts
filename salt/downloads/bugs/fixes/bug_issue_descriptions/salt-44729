I was pleased to discover the rsync state because it is an order of magnitude faster that file.recurse

rsync.synchronized state ran in dry mode returns the following output

```
----------
          ID: /sync-dir
    Function: rsync.synchronized
      Result: None
     Comment: - sent 260 bytes
              - received 2,437 bytes
              - 1,798.00 bytes/sec
              - total size is 72,321,289
              - speedup is 26,815.46 (DRY RUN)

The behavious seems to be done on purpose (with the "summary" terms)

however I believe it should be more relevant to have the local file modifications announced like other salt states.

)
updating
`
 return "- " + "\n- ".join([elm for elm in rsync_out.split("\n\n")[0].replace("  ", "\n").split("\n")[1:] if elm])
`
to have usable output
