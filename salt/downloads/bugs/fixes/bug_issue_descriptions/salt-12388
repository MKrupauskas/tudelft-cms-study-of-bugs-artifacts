Running salt from develop I can successfully create a vm, but cannot delete a vm when using providers whose drivers don't have an "optimize_providers" function.

My server is an Ubuntu 12.04 vm:

```
root@boucha:/etc/salt# salt --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.1.0-5374-g871d218 (Hydrogen)
         Python: 2.7.3 (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:58:35)
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.22
 msgpack-python: 0.4.2
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
         PyYAML: 3.11
          PyZMQ: 14.1.1
            ZMQ: 4.0.4
```

Proof of a vm on DigitalOcean:

```
root@boucha:/etc/salt# salt davedocker100 test.ping
davedocker100:
    True
```

An attempt to delete the vm:

```
root@boucha:/etc/salt# salt-cloud -d davedocker100
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[ERROR   ] Public cloud provider openstack is not available
[ERROR   ] Public cloud provider digital_ocean is not available
[INFO    ] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
No machines were found to be destroyed
```

An attempt to delete the vm in debug mode:

```
