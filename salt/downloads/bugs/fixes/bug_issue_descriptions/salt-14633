When I try to enable a service on SLES I get "Enable is not available on this minion"

The issue is in rh_service.py (lines 39 to 69) and is related to fixing https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8428

Since this bug fix the grain osrelease has characters in it, Ex :  "11 SP3", wich means the try clause return false (lines 60 and 61)

Furthermore, the grain os is returning "SUSE" and no longer 'SUSE  Enterprise Server' (line 54)

Here are the grains related to the os for SLES 11 SP3 :
  os: SUSE
  os_family: Suse
  osarch: x86_64
  oscodename: n.a
  osfullname: SUSE
  osrelease: 11 SP3
