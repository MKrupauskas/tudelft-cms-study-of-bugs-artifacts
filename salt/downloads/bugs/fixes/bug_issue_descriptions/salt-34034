Hi,

I'm trying to update salt in stages, first the master and then minions in blocks

The problem I'm getting is similar to issue #27219

With a minion running 2015.5.10 and master running > 2015.8.0 
If I specify a compound target in nodegroups the minion doesn't reply.

Example config:

```
nodegroups:
 group1: 'L@node1'
 group3: 'G@os:Centos and N@group1'
```

I also tried an or with two nodegroups.

Example test:

```
salt -N group3   test.ping
jid: 20160615145657757972
node1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

minion debug log:
`2016-06-15 15:04:06,735 [salt.minion      ][DEBUG   ][19681] Compound target received that is not a string`
