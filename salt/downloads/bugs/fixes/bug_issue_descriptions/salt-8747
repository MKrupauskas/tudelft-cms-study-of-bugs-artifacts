I can't currently seem to use `salt-cloud` (master as of now) as it is documented. [Following the YAML here](http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.botocore_aws.html#the-aws-cloud-module) and copying it into `cloud.providers.d/aws.conf` verbatim I get the following:

```
$ salt-cloud --list-providers

I originally was trying to make my own configuration but I had no luck. It also seems to happen if I don't use `cloud.providers.d/aws.conf` but `cloud.providers` directly.

Note: I'm using `--providers-config`.
