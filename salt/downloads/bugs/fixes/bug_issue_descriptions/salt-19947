Hello,

I found it not possible to supply the post_uri parameter of [1] from the CloudClient.create() when creating softlayer VMs. This is important when a couple of settings need to be made in order to allow the freshly spawned minion to be contactable by the salt master.

An example scenario:
The fresh minion does not have a public IP. The master is on a different site (different internal subnet), and the two private subnets are connect by a VPN. In this case after SL provisions the new VM, a provisioning script is needed to set the proper routing parameters.

By being able to pass the post_uri from the cloudclient's create() to softlayer's API, it makes it possible to do the required adjustments on the freshly spawned VM, therefore saltstack will be able to reach the new VM and bootstrap the salt-minion.
