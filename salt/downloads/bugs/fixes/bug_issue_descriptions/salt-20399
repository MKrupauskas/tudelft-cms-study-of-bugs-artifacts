When I run `salt mytarget state.highstate` with `test=True` it outputs several unchanged items with `Result: Differs`. From that output, it appears if the state will get updated. I'd expect these changes to be applied with `test=False` option. However, when I run the same command with `test=False` none of the expected changes are deemed necessary and I get `Succeeded: 0, Failed: 0`. In my case, the changes are files `file.managed` states.
