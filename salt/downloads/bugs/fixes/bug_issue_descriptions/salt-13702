```
************* Module salt.modules.schedule
salt/modules/schedule.py:334: [E1103(maybe-no-member), modify] Instance of 'str' has no 'items' member (but some types could not be inferred)
```

If there is a `time_conflict`, then `build_schedule_item()` returns a string error message.
This case is not being checked for; the code in question assumes that a dict will always be returned.
