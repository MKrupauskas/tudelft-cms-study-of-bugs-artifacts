**Description**

Updating the disks of a VM with LVM volumes that already exists fails as it tries to create the new disk. See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53081#issuecomment-851296460 for full detail.

**Setup**

Minion setup to reproduce the issue:
  * Install software needed for virtualization.
  * Add an empty disk to the minion (will be `/dev/vdb` in the these steps) 
  * Run these commands to setup the LV:
  
```
pvcreate /dev/vdb
vgcreate ssd /dev/vdb
lvcreate -L 10G -n vm_root ssd
```

The minion should now have a LV with path to `/dev/ssd/vm_root`

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Apply the following state:

```yaml
vm:
  virt.running:
    - name: lvtest
    - cpu: 1
    - mem: 512
    - disks:
      - name: system
        model: virtio
        device: disk
        image: /path/to/a/disk/template.qcow2
    - interfaces:
      - name: eth0
        type: network
        source: default
    - graphics:
        type: vnc
    - seed: False
```

This should succeed. Now edit the state to add the following disk:

```yaml
      - name: data
        format: raw
        source_file: /dev/ssd/vm_root
```

And apply the state again.

**Expected behavior**

The `/dev/ssd/vm_root` disk is added to the VM
