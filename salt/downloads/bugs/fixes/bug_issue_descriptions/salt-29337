The execution module virt is enabled when we have the libvirt binding available. 

On a number of our hosts have libvirt clients and python binding but not libvirtd running.  virt.vm_info raises CommandExecutionError in this usecase.

Two questions : 
- should we have better checks in the **virtual** to see if we can establish a connection (or if conn_str is default and that libvirtd is not running return False)
- should this be a logged warning instead of a raise ?
