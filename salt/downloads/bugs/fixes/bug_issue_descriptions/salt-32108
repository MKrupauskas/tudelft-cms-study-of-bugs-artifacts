### Description of Issue/Question

We had a situation in volume testing when Salt would incorrectly think that a job was done.  It would then try to run the state again but it would fail with an error message.  When it did so we would get a cryptic error message:

```
2016-03-21 19:15:45,211 [salt.state                               ][ERROR   ][1003][139775351428864] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

    return iter(d.itervalues(**kw))
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'itervalues'
```
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Reproducing this will involve explicitly trying to run two states at the same time..
