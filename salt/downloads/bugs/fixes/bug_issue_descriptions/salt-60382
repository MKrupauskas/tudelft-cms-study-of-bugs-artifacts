**Description**
Currently the `zabbix_host.present` state only sends properties to the zabbix API that it detects have changed, which is correct. However, sending `inventory` to the API will also change `inventory_mode` to `'0'` (manual). In order to mix manual and automatic inventory it needs setting to `'1'` (automatic). Salt will do this on the next state application, but it would be better to have done it all at once.

**Setup**
```sls
zabbix host:
  zabbix_host.present:
    - host: {{ grains['id'] }}
    - inventory_mode: '1'
    - inventory:
      - vendor: {{ grains['manufacturer'] }}
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Zabbix 4.4 (older versions do not support `inventory_mode` correctly).
Apply the above state when the vendor needs updating.

**Expected behavior**
API request should include `inventory_mode` to ensure it is not automatically changed.
