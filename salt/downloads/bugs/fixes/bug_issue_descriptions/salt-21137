1. add `master_job_cache: mysql` to /etc/salt/master file
2. restart salt-master service 
3. run any command i.e. `salt '*' test.ping` 

Get this warning:

```
[ WARNING ] Returner unavailable: MySQL returner could not connect to database: (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)") 
```

I'm guessing that we don't want this message to be displayed.
