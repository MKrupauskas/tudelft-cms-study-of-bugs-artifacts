### Description of Issue/Question

`salt-run state.event` fails to display the event bus. It appears that `print` and `log.*` messages are not being pushed to stdout.
### Setup

Install salt from the develop branch
Start the master and minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `salt-run state.event`
Run `salt <minion> test.ping`
Nothing will appear in the `state.event` shell

Note: `log.debug` and `print` commands placed in the `state.event` execution module code failed to display their text in the shell. They also did not display when placed in the `state.event` runner module.
### Versions Report

Problem found on Windows Server 2008 R2. Also fails to run properly on Fedora 22.

Head of develop branch
