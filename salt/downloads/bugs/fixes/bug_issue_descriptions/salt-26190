Hi!

I'm not really sure what's happening. I had a pkg.latest on a bunch of packages. Today I added rpm "ftp" to the list. Running salt, pkg installation failed repeatedly! I switched the minion to debug level, and did a run, please find the log file at http://ur1.ca/nel2y

When I switched pkg.latest to pkg.installed it worked! Also, if I had tried the "yum -y install xxxx" command in the log file before that, it seemed to work fine too! Not sure what's going on here

Thanks
