**Description**
When a minion is offline, pillar targetting will incorrectly target that minion resulting in an error which will then break orchestration with dependencies between states.


**Setup**
One minion is offline (eg. for maintenance)


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
    # salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar
    # salt -I 'unused_key:123' test.version
    dead-minion:
        Minion did not return. [No response]
        The minions may not have all finished running and any remaining minions will return upon completion. To look up the return data for this job later, run the following command:
    
        salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20210811003619253412
```


**Expected behavior**
Pillar is rendered on the server, so the server cache is only used for targetting. Commands should not be sent to offline minions.
