**Description**
Following the directions here: https://saltstack.gitlab.io/open/docs/salt-install-guide/topics/install/native/arista.html, when trying to install the Salt native minion 3003.3, a number of dependency errors are enountered and the extension does not install

**Setup**
Download vEOS Lab Vagrant box from https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download

**vEOS-lab-4.24.8M-virtualbox.box**

Using Vagrant with the following Vagrantfile:

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# On Windows, only supported if running under Linux Subsystem for Windows
if Vagrant::Util::Platform.windows?
    puts 'Linux Subsystem for Windows required on Windows hosts.  Please refer to Windows.md for further instruction.'
    abort 
end

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.define "switch" do |switch|
    switch.vm.box = "veos"
    switch.ssh.insert_key = false

    # VM can be really slow unless COM1 is connected to something.
    (File.exist?("/proc/version") and File.readlines("/proc/version").grep(/(Microsoft|WSL)/).size > 0) ? ( re_log = "NUL" ) : ( re_log = "/dev/null" )
    switch.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
      v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--uartmode1", "file", re_log]
    end
 
    if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-vbguest")
      switch.vbguest.auto_update = false
    end
 
    switch.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 15022, id: 'ssh'
    switch.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 443, host: 15443, id: 'https'
    switch.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "link_1", ip: "169.254.1.11", auto_config: false
    switch.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "link_2", ip: "169.254.1.11", auto_config: false

    switch.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
    switch.vm.box_check_update = false
  end
end
```
Download and copy the extension:

`curl https://repo.saltproject.io/salt/py3/arista/i386/3003/salt-3003.3-1.32.swix -O salt-3003.3-1.32.swix`

Copy it to the guest:

`vagrant scp salt-3003.3-1.32.swix /mnt/flash/ switch`

Install the extension:

```
