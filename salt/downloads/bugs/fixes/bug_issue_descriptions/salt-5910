I've made a typo in one of my pillar file:
pillar/newrelic.sls:

```
newrelic_license_key = NOT_A_CHANCE
```

And it lead to some weird errors on minion side: https://novapaste.novapost.net/paste/b62eaf0f6048bd3c667fee65633c5357fd3bba53#IL6Fsf1iUDVpbAaLrYACP3gD4aGr8dUFMbQv5li/Axk=

And then from the master side, when I tried to run some command, I've no output at all. Example: https://novapaste.novapost.net/paste/0cc195826f6488a63320cd7244f041aea9757b84#ut1lKYbHWlEghhwLwq6bAnVKkBwBOwVs5VTExHznbC4=

It's not blocking as I solved my pillar file typo but I've lost some time on found the problem.
