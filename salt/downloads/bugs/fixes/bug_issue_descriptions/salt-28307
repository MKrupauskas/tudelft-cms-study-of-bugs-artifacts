I have two windows 2012 instances on AWS on which I installed Chocolatey.

1.) Machine 1 - Manually
2.) Machine 2 - using chocolatey.bootstrap

Both got installed with Chocoloatey 0.9.9.11 version.

Next, I was trying to install packages on these machines/minions from master by firing command:

> > sudo salt 'windows*' chocolatey.install jdk7 (OR Any other package name)

But I got the error:

```
 [ec2-user@ip-172---]$ sudo salt 'windows*' chocolatey.install jdk7
windows2-minion:
    ERROR: Unable to determine Chocolatey version
windows-minion:
    ERROR: Unable to determine Chocolatey version 
```
## 

What is the correct command?
