My system runs a lot of test-highstates to check whether there are any changes made to the system bypassing salt. Since a week or something they sometimes hang. Running another (test-)highstate gives:

```
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 18861 and was started at 2014, Oct 06 10:49:30.897978 with jid 20141006104930897978
```

strace tells me this, looping forever seemingly without doing anything else:

```
open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY)          = 30
read(30, "[16 random bytes]", 16) = 16
close(30)                               = 0
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
write(26, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)        = 8
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 60000) = 1 ([{fd=28, revents=POLLIN}])
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 1 ([{fd=28, revents=POLLIN}])
read(28, "\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)         = 8
poll([{fd=28, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 20000}) = 0 (Timeout)
```

I'm using our own compiled version of 2014.7.0rc1 (git revision 20f2334 to be exact). If updating to rc2 would help I'm willing to do so.

(I've got the feeling I've opened this issue before, but I might've forgotten to hit Submit due to being distracted and/or trying to win some more information.)
