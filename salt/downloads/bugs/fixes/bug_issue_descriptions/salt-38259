### Description of Issue/Question
it appears that https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/8957631c3d72e65091b70681966cbc7f195c204d changes the assumption that configuration option: `auth.ldap.groupclass` should be a groupclass, and has set that option to be a user class.  
```            
           for user, entry in search_results:
                if username == user.split(',')[0].split('=')[-1]:
```
search_results used to return `for group, entry` but..
this change only works because the commit author has set auth.ldap.groupclass to return users, and then filters for 'memberOf' attribute.
`auth.ldap.groupclass: 'person'` <-- this 
`auth.ldap.groupattribute: 'memberOf'` <-- and this

Not all openldap servers have 'memberOf' overlay enabled, and previously that list would be a list of groups, and members of those groups.

### Setup
using standard config values there is no way for this to work:
`auth.ldap.groupclass: posixGroup`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
added debug logging to show that `for user, entry in search_results` user is a groupname when actually setting this to a group class.
