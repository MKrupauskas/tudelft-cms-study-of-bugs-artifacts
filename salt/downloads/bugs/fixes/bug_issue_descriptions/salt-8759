Anything that calls _available_services in the launchctl module seems to fail. I closely followed the steps in the HACKING.rst file to set up my environment. When I ran salt-call -c "path_to_config_directory" service.get_all, which calls _available_services, this is what I got:

I tried running the command as root and got very similar output, which – I assume – would rule out a permissions issue. Looks like it doesn't handle symbolic links in _launchd_paths properly. This is the ls output I get on that file: 

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   104B Feb 15  2013 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist -> /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/com.oracle.java.Java-Updater.plist

Perhaps the exception needs to follow symbolic links.
