On file.recurse, debug logs show messages like the following:

```
[DEBUG   ] In saltenv 'base', looking at rel_path '|mystate/files/recursedir/file.txt' to resolve 'salt://|mystate/files/recursedir/file.txt'
```

In the minion cache directory there exists a directory `|mystate` with folders but no files, in addition to the normal cache directory `mystate` which holds the files as expected.

This might be a regression reintroducing #5013

I have PR incoming which fixes it.
