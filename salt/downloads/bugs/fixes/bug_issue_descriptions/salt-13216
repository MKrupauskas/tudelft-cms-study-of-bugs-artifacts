The following steps was reproduced on Fedora 20 but can be similarly done on any other OS.
### Setup

Create a simple state file which installs any uninstalled package (here: `bind`):

```
# path: /srv/salt/deleteme.sls
install_dns_server:
    pkg.installed:
        - name: bind
```

Use this state in [orchestration](http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt5.html#the-orchestrate-runner):

```
# path: /srv/salt/deleteme_orchestration.sls
install_dns_server_with_orchestration:
    salt.state:
        - tgt: 'minion_id'
        - sls: deleteme
```

Now make sure that `yum` somehow fails to install any package. For example, you may set wrong DNS in `/etc/resolv.conf` or add a non-existing proxy to `/etc/yum.conf` like here:

```
# Proxy settings
proxy=http://whatever:8000/
proxy_username=whatever
proxy_password=whatever
```

Try running `yum install bind` manually to confirm it fails.
### Problem

Run orchestrate runner:

```
salt-run -l debug state.orchestrate deleteme_orchestration > results.yaml
```

The debug output does not produce any `[ERROR   ]`.
Check results:

```
# results.yaml
control:
----------
          ID: install_dns_server_with_orchestration
    Function: salt.state
      Result: True
     Comment: States ran successfully.
     Changes:

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total:     1
```

**This is clearly** **_false**_ **because:**

```
rpm -qi bind
package bind is not installed
```

Moreover, running the initial state using `salt-call` fails perfectly:

```
salt-call -l debug state.sls deleteme > results.yaml
...
[INFO    ] Executing command 'repoquery --queryformat="%{NAME}_|-%{VERSION}_|-%{RELEASE}_|-%{ARCH}_|-%{REPOID}" --all --pkgnarrow=installed' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] The following packages failed to install/update: bind.
...

```

Check results:

```
# results.yaml
local:
----------
          ID: install_dns_server
    Function: pkg.installed
        Name: bind
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: bind.
     Changes:

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 0
Failed:    1

Total:     1
```
