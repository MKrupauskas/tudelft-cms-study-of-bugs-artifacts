same problem (i386 package, amd64 minion) as in #19512:
package with "foreign" architecture is normally installed, but an error is reported.

sls file:

```
packages_for_class_debs:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: s4a:i386
    - sources:
      # from http://s4a.cat/
      - s4a: salt://files/S4A16.deb
    - require:
      - cmd: add_i386_architecture
add_i386_architecture:
  cmd.run:
    - name: dpkg --add-architecture i386 && apt-get update
    - unless: dpkg --print-foreign-architectures | grep -q i386
```
salt-call output (foreign architecture i386 has already been added):

```
$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply

if i try to remove the architecture from the name (s4a:i386 -> s4a), the error is the same:
```
$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply
