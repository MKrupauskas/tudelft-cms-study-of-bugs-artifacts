I have created a very simple set of packages and managed files (2 of each to establish the pattern).

In each of the following cases the file.managed works by itself, when run before the pkg.installed, or when run with another file.managed, but fails with the following stack trace if it follows a pkg.installed state:

```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "salt/state.py", line 1371, in call
                File "salt/states/file.py", line 1240, in managed
                File "salt/modules/file.py", line 2305, in check_managed
                File "salt/modules/file.py", line 2068, in get_managed
              NameError: global name '__salt__' is not defined
```

For testing purposes I am managing files completely unrelated to the pkg commands; this is really probably a minor bug as it requires only reordering states in top.sls, but it's frustrating when it appears (and re-appears).

My pkg.installed sls's:

```
# cat win_java/init.sls 
win_java:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - name: java
    - version: 6.0.310

# cat winPython/init.sls 
winPython:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: python
    - version: 2.7.6150
```

My file.managed sls's:

```
# cat squishLicense/init.sls 
squishLicense:
  file:
    - managed
    - name: 'C:\Users\{{ salt['pillar.get']('squish_user', '<redacted>') }}\.squish-3-license'
    - source: salt://squishLicense/.squish-3-license

# cat win_unzip/init.sls 
{% set staging_dir = salt['pillar.get']('installer_dir','C:\Tools') %}

win_unzip:
  file:
    - managed
    - name: {{ staging_dir }}\unzip.exe
    - source: salt://win_unzip/unzip.exe
```

Test Case 1: managed file before package install: success

```
