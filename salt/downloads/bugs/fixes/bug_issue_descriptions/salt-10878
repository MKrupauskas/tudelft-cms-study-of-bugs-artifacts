I found that occasionally appear in version 0.17.5 
"Source file salt://xxxx.conf not found" a problem when dealing with files. 
But in the master file actually exists. After the retry recovery. minion number of 20 + simultaneous synchronization states 

Read the fileserver/roots.py not find why there hash_file return None circumstances. 

Exception code 
"salt/modules/file.py" 1622 lines 
1620 source_sum = __ salt__ ['cp.hash_file'](source, env) 
1621 if not source_sum: 
1622     return'', {}, 'Source file {0} not found'. Format (source)
