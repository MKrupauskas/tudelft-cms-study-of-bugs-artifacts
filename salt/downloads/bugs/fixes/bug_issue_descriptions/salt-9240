In the following example the source file exists.  However, file.copy reports the source file does not exist while file.managed sees the source file and copies it.  Because I do not want the target file to be overwritten if it exists, I need to use file.copy not file.managed.    

```
D:\\teamcity-buildagent\conf\buildAgent.properties:
  file:
    - copy
    - source: salt://templates/buildAgent.properties
    - require:
      - cmd: teamcity-unzip-buildagent
```

results in

```
[INFO    ] Executing state file.copy for D:\\teamcity-buildagent\conf\buildAgent.properties
[ERROR   ] Source file "salt://templates/buildAgent.properties" is not present
[ERROR   ] Unable to write to "state.sls" cache file c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\sls.p
```

Now, if I replace "- copy" with "- managed" in the state file, the file is copied from source.
