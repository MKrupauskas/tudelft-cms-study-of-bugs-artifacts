### Description of Issue

On FreeBSD 11, ever since updating to the Python 3.6 version of Salt, we sporadically see (perhaps 1 out of 10 times) the salt-minion fail to fully start up, though there is no explicit indication of any trouble. The start command exits after appearing to succeed, the salt-minion process is running, and there are no errors reported on command line or in logs, even at DEBUG level, but the minion is unreachable and the process will not go down without a `kill -9`.

### Setup

The only non-default settings in our minion config are these:
```
log_file: file:///var/run/log/LOG_LOCAL5
log_fmt_console: '%(colorlevel)s %(colormsg)s'
log_level_logfile: debug
master_finger: '[OUR MASTER FINGERPRINT HERE]'
```
and in the master config:
```
nodegroups:
  [OUR LOCALLY DEFINED NODEGROUPS HERE]
log_file: file:///var/run/log/LOG_LOCAL5
log_fmt_console: '%(colorlevel)s %(colormsg)s'
log_level_logfile: debug
timeout: 5
```
We have no non-default runtime variables set for Salt.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Logs show the startup getting to the same point every time, before it ceases further activity: on the minion, the final item is always `Closing AsyncZeroMQReqChannel instance`, while on the master the final action is sending the public key. Here are the final few lines from the minion:
```

```
and from the master:
```

```
