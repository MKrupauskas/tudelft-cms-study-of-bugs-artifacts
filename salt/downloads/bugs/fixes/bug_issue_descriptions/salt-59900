**Description**
salt-minion is unable to verify packages are installed (presumably install the if requried.
This is an identical bug to 
salt minion broken in CentOS Stream #59161

with the "same" fix: Add 
```
"Springdale Open Enterprise": "RedHat",
```
to  
```
/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/grains/core.py
```

**Setup**
```
chrony:
  pkg:
    - installed
  service.running:
    - name: chronyd
    - enable: true
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/chrony.conf
  user.present:
    - home: /var/lib/chrony
    - shell: /sbin/nologin
```


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Install Springdale linux 8.3 (clone of Redhat) 
```
 curl -fsSL https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/redhat/8/x86_64/3002.repo | tee /etc/yum.repos.d/salt.repo
 yum install salt salt-minion 
 salt-call state.apply sls/ntp
```

**Expected behavior**
```
          ID: chrony
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: All specified packages are already installed
     Started: 08:27:13.258915

**Screenshots**
```
          ID: chrony
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False

              Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False: pkg module could not be loaded
