on 2015.05 applying the pkgrepo.absent state shows no errors, but silently fails removing the file with the deb line on ubuntu.

```
----------
          ID: logentries-repo
    Function: pkgrepo.absent
        Name: deb http://rep.logentries.com/ precise main
      Result: True

              repo:
                  deb http://rep.logentries.com/ precise main
```

debug log isn't helpful, too:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [deb http://rep.logentries.com/ precise main] at time 07:18:45.521783
[INFO    ] Executing state pkgrepo.absent for deb http://rep.logentries.com/ precise main

[INFO    ] Completed state [deb http://rep.logentries.com/ precise main] at time 07:18:45.636724
```

i've just changed the whole state from pkgrepo.managed to pkgrepo.absent, so i'm sure there can't be any typo or missing data.
