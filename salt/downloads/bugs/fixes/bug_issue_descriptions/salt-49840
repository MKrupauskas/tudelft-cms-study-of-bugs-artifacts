### Description of Issue/Question

Can't connect to a minion via `salt-ssh`, although plain `ssh` works just fine.  It looks like salt does reverse IP lookup and then uses this new address to connect via ssh. The machine is located behind a NAT and the connection is established via port-forwarding.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
% salt-ssh --user pi --sudo -i minion.example.com test.ping

11-22-33-44.provider.com:
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname 11-22-33-44.provider.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

The same with IP address:

```
% salt-ssh --user pi --sudo -i 11.22.33.44 test.ping

11-22-33-44.provider.com:
    ssh: Could not resolve hostname 11-22-33-44.provider.com: nodename nor servname provided, or not known
```

DNS info:

```
dig +short minion.example.com
11.22.33.44

dig +short -x 11.22.33.44
11.22.33.44.provider.com.

dig +short 11.22.33.44.provider.com.
```

Note the last command. It doesn't return anything, and that is the reason why it fails.

And also the second command `dig +short -x 11.22.33.44` could return any garbage (it is set up by the hosting provider, not by the owner of example.com). Salt shouldn't trust that data to connect to hosts.

The log below shows that salt-ssh uses reverse hostname to connect and not the one I specified on the command line. I feel this could be potentially bad security-wise.

```

```
