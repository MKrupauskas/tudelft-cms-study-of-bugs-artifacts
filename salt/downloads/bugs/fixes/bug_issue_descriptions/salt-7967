I have written a state:

```
"{{maindir}}/Repo":
    file.recurse:
        - source: salt://nodes/Stack/Repo
```

and this works fine on a minion of version 0.16.3 running under Windows.  Under /srv/salt I have a nodes directory that contains the directories Stack and Repo under that.

If I run the same thing on a minion of version 0.17.0 or greater under Windows I get this error:

```

WindowsError: [Error 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'c:\\salt\\var\\cache\\salt\\minion\\files\\base\\|nodes'
```

Now the first thing I notice is that we have a '|' character in the path of a file being created in the minion's cache directory.  This is an invalid path name.

Initially 'nodes' was a symbolic link on the master's file server, but I have since changed it to a real directory with the same results.

This seems like a bug to me since it works on 0.16.3 without issue.
