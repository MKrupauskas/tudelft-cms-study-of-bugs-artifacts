Hi, in
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/auth/ldap.py#L230

ldap group membership is only added when the targeted user is the first entry in the array

```
if entry['memberUid'][0] == username:
```

This doesn't need to be the case, from adding some debugging I see

```
[DEBUG   ] [('cn=group1,ou=Salt,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com', {'memberUid': ['user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4', ..., 'userN', 'rvstaveren'], 'cn': ['group1']}), ('cn=group2,ou=Salt,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com', {'memberUid': ['user1', 'user2', 'user3', 'user4', ..., 'userN', 'rvstaveren'], 'cn': ['group2']})]
[DEBUG   ] User rvstaveren is a member of groups: []
```

I can open up a pull request and do either the following
- Remove the whole membership check, we've already checked this by the ldap search (`'(&(memberUid={0})(objectClass=posixGroup))'`) so this is superfluous 
- change it into `username in entry['memberUid']`
