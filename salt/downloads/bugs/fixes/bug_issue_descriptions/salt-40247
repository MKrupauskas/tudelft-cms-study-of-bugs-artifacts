### Description of Issue/Question
When calling boto_rds.delete with a wait_for_deletion=True, boto_rds.delete will fail to check the deletion process status and always wait for the timeout to pass.

The root cause is here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2016.11.3/salt/modules/boto_rds.py#L635
The if statement checks the return value of boto_rds.exists as boolean value without processing it.
boto_rds.exists doesn't return boolean value but a dict, and never an empty dict.
So the If statement body is never executed and the method keeps looping until the timeout pass.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Read the code :)
