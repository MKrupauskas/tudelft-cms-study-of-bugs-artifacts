After running for some hours, the salt minion process has died.  This appears in dmesg output:

```
[28594.747901] init: salt-minion main process (1251) terminated with status 134
```

Salt version is salt-minion 2014.1.0-1precise1, running on Ubuntu 12.04.

No output in /var/log/salt/minion, no errors or warnings on the master log.

I have restarted the minions with logging set to debug.
