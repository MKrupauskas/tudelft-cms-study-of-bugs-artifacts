### Description of Issue/Question

We set grains_cache true, but the loader.py code sets the cfn after it tests if grains_cache is true, but then later in the grains def, you test for it again and it seems to have changed, therefore cfn isn't defined and it pops on that state.  If we move the definition of cfn up 3 lines, it works fine.  I am not completely sure this is the best approach however.

Here is my patch.

``` diff
diff  /tmp/loader.py /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py


558a559,562
>     cfn = os.path.join(
>         opts['cachedir'],
>         'grains.cache.p'
>     )
561,564d564
<             cfn = os.path.join(
<                 opts['cachedir'],
<                 'grains.cache.p'
<             )
```
