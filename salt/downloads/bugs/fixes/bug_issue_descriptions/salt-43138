### Description of Issue/Question
The `npm.installed` state throws an error when installing certain packages. I was able to track this down to packages where "is installed via remote" is printed to stdout. (Whatever that means, it's not really Google-able.) Examples for such packages are "sqlite3" or "bcrypt", and the exact line looks like this:

> [bcrypt] Success: "/tmp/npm-test/node_modules/bcrypt/lib/binding/bcrypt_lib.node" is installed via remote"

However, the packages acutally are successfully installed, so a subsequent highstate will succeed.

The cause for this appears to be that the `npm.install` module cannot parse the output of `npm install --silent --json` because of that line. It therefore returns a string, which the `npm.installed` state counts as failure.

Since #35075, there already is the special `_extract_json()` function in place, which tries to isolate the JSON from the other output like this:

    while lines and not lines[0].startswith('{') and not lines[0].startswith('['):
        lines = lines[1:]
    while lines and not lines[-1].startswith('}') and not lines[-1].startswith(']'):
        lines = lines[:-1]

Unfortunately, the line from above starts with a '[', although it's not part of the JSON.

NPM *appears* to always output a JSON object (not a list), so the checks could *probably* be limited to `startswith('{')`. But what do I know, I can't even find documentation for NPM's JSON output.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create a target directory like "/tmp/npm-test" on the minion and try to install a NPM package like "sqlite3" or "bcrypt" using `npm.installed` like this:

    sqlite3:
      npm.installed:
        - dir: /tmp/npm-test

It will fail with the error "Could not install package(s) 'sqlite3'", but the package will still be installed.
