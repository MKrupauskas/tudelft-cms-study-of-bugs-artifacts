### Description of Issue

The event returned from a state.single module execution has `retcode` set to 0 despite the fact, that the function argument does not map to a valid function. This in particular affects orchestration runs, which cannot detect the error for this case.

```
state_not_exists:
  salt.function:
    - name: state.single
    - tgt: testminion
    - arg:
      - state.doesnotexist
      - state_not_exists

```
### Setup

latest develop branch
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

To reproduce the problem , one does not need an orchestration state. Looking at the event bus is sufficient.

```
salt testminion state.single muh.maeh somename
testminion:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Specified state 'muh.maeh' was not found
```

at the same time / monitor the salt event bus

```
salt-run state.event
salt/job/20160601164315705689/ret/testminion    {"fun_args": ["muh.maeh", "somename"], "jid": "20160601164315705689", "return": ["Specified state 'muh.maeh' was not found"], "retcode": 0, "success": true, "cmd": "_return", "_stamp": "2016-06-01T14:43:23.602401", "fun": "state.single", "id": "testminion", "out": "highstate"}
```
