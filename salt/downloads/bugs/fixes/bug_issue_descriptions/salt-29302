... in particular if the scheduler has not changed. 

I have a task that is spread out on my infrastructure and runs every 6 hours. This load is usually quite spreaded. But when I do a `salt \* saltutil.refresh_pillar` all minions start this task at the same time. 

I had filed an issue about the fact that the schedule task could have an option not to run at the minion start, but can't find it right now. This is a similar problem.
