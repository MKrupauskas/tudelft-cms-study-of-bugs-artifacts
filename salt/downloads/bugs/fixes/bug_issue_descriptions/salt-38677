### Description of Issue/Question
When using consul as a backend for the minion cache, you can run into ```SaltCacheError: There was an error getting the key "set([u'host1', u'host2', u'host3', u'host4'])": unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'set' and 'str'```

This is because in consul.py there is a function called `list`, which of course conflicts with the type `list()`. This function also tries to return a casted list, but actually returns itself because of this clash.
