Enabling and disabling individual beacons that use YAML block sequences ("- ") fails with no comment.

Example of the problematic beacon configuration:

```
beacons:
  my_beacon:
    - enabled: False
    - interval: 60
```

When the beacon is configured as above, we don't get any comment that it's wrong but salt does not apply the update:

```
root@5a4791a27ff5:/# salt '*' beacons.enable_beacon my_beacon
minion1:
    ----------
    comment:
    result:
        True
root@5a4791a27ff5:/# salt '*' beacons.list
minion1:
    beacons:
      enabled: true
      my_beacon:
      - enabled: false
      - interval: 60
```

If we change the beacon to use indented YAML notation, it works:

```
beacons:
  my_beacon:
    enabled: False
    interval: 60
```

Is this the expected behavior? If so, I can submit a pull request to update the documentation. If it isn't, I think the problematic section in the code is in [beacons/**init**.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/beacons/__init__.py) line 244, we try to update the options as though the beacon config is a dictionary when it could be a list.
