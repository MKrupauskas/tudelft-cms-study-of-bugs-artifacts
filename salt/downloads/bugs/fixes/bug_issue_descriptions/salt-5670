I'm using highstate as the setting for startup_states on my minions and I've noticed that there  is a one minute pause at the start of the highstate execution. This is really annoying because my minions are diskless machines and they need to run highstate to get the configuration for the services they are running.

Having dug around a bit I noticed it was backing off from a failed attempt to contact the salt master for a minute, but the initial call to mine.update was running at the same time and working fine. I tried adding a half second sleep after the call to self._state_run() in minion.py. With this the minute pause goes away.
