I noticed that in the change made to use the bootstrap function in #25543 for GCE, the bootstrap function never actually gets called. I added:

```
ret = salt.utils.cloud.bootstrap(vm_, __opts__)
```

to the GCE driver, and switched the return value from `return node_dict` to `return ret` and I got the following output:

```

I reverted my changes to see what would happen without the bootstrap function call, in case I was misunderstanding how GCE works, and I got the following out put:

```
nt-gce-2:
    ----------
    _uuid:
        None

        name:

    name:

        - x.x.x.x
    size:
        n1-standard-1
    state:
        0
```

This makes it look like the deploy/bootstrap was successful, but in face there is no minion running on the machine.

I might be doing something incorrectly in my configuration file, but the same behavior is exhibiting itself in 2015.5.

@techhat and @erjohnso - am I misunderstanding/misconfiguring something? I can connect to GCE just fine via `-p` and other `--list-*` functions.
