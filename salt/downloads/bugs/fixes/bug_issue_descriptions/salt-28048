Hello,

deployment with salt 2015.8.1 (version report at the end) on debian 8.2 to proxmox 4.0-50 fails.

Other parts, like salt-cloud --list-images my-proxmox-config, are working as expected.

Did proxmox maybe change it's API with version 4 and it's not supported? I saw that LXC deployment is not possible with proxmox (and it throws errors if I try anyway ;) ).

provider config:

``` yaml
my-proxmox-config:
  # Set up the location of the salt master
  #
  minion:
    master: salt.local

  # Set the PROXMOX access credentials (see below)
  #
  user: salt@pam
  password: badpw

  # Set the access URL for your PROXMOX host
  #
  url: proxmox.local
  verify_ssl: False
  driver: proxmox
```

profile config:

``` yaml
proxmox-debian:
    provider: my-proxmox-config
    #image: local:vztmpl/debian-8.0-standard_8.0-1_amd64.tar.gz
    image: local:iso/debian-8.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso
    technology: qemu
    host: proxmox.local
    #ip_address: 192.168.1.50
    #ssh_username: root
    #password: badpw
    #nameserver: 192.168.1.1
    disk: 10
    size: ''
    #cpus: 1
    #cpuunits: 1024
    #memory: 1024
    #swap: 2048
    #onboot: 1
```

verbose output from failed salt-cloud -l all -p proxmox-debian test1
