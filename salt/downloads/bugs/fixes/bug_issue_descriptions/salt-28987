The `py-salt` package has disappeared from the FreeBSD package database in the last few hours.

I'm testing FreeBSD 10.2 on EC2, and this morning I was able to install Salt via pkg. As of 2 hours ago, it's no longer working.

To make sure I wasn't losing my sanity, I removed my local database and re-updated it, and py-salt is indeed gone.

```
[root@test-01 ~]# rm /var/db/pkg/repo-FreeBSD.sqlite
[root@test-01 ~]# pkg update

```

Technically, this could be directed at FreeBSD, but I think there are some people here who are more in tune with the packaging team.

@cedwards halp?
