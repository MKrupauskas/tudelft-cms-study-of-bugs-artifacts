According to official Arch installation notes, a servers hostname should be stored in /etc/hostname (not /etc/hosts).

This causes issues when generating new salt keys, and when grains refresh for the fqdn grain.  Salt is pulling out localhost from the /etc/hosts file instead of the actual hostname from /etc/hosts.
