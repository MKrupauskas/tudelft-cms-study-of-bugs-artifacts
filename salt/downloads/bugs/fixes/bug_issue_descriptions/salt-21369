We had the following state:

``` yaml
example_apt_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Example Main Repo
    - name: deb http://apt.example.com/{{grains['os'] | lower}} {{grains['oscodename']}} main
    - dist: {{ grains['oscodename'] }}
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/example.list
```

This was changed to:

``` yaml
example_apt_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Example Main Repo
    - name: deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.example.com/{{grains['os'] | lower}} {{grains['oscodename']}} main
    - dist: {{ grains['oscodename'] }}
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/example.list
    - clean_file: True
```

However, executing highstate does not result in the file being modified with the new `[arch=amd64]` entry. If I remove `sources.list.d/example.list` and highstate the minion again, it is added in properly.

Data from the minion debug doesn't help much either:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state pkgrepo.managed for deb [arch=amd64] http://apt.example.com/ubuntu trusty main

```
