the `shutdown` command on Solaris is different than on linux.
e.g.

``` bash
# shutdown the system (poweroff)
shutdown -i5 -g0 -y

# reboot the system (reboot)
shutdown -i6 -g0 -y
```

Optionally `-f` can be passed to do a 'fastboot' but it depends on the hardware if it works.

Ideally the existing one should not be loaded on os_family = Solaris. And a solaris_system should take it's place.
