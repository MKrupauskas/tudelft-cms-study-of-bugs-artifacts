ISSUE: the salt/presence/change event in 2015.5 is always reporting the full list of connected minions as "newly connected", despite the fact that their connection wasn't disrupted.

As I can see in the master.py source file, the presence handling code has been moved into a separate function and now the `old_present` list is referenced and assigned in local scope, what makes it remain empty in every run of the main master maintenance loop.

Relevant code lines:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2015.5.0/salt/master.py#L260-275
and
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2015.5.0/salt/master.py#L183

My master config:

```
presence_events: True
```

Event example:

```
# salt-run state.event pretty=True
salt/presence/change    {
    "_stamp": "2015-05-15T16:33:56.944705", 
    "lost": [], 
    "new": [
        <here goes every time the list of all currently connected minions>
    ]
}
```
