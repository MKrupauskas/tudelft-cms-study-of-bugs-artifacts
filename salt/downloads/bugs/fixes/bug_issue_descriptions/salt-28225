## Problem Description

It looks like the ability to disable YUM repositories is broken in Redhat based distros (possibly due to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/22406 ?). When attempting to disable two repos using the following state file:

```
disable_repos:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - names:
      - "base"
      - "updates"
    - disabled: True
```

The *.repo files get `disabled=True` added to them instead of `enabled=0`. YUM doesn't recognize the "disabled" parameter ([reference](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/yum.conf.5.html)), so the repositories don't actually get disabled as expected.
