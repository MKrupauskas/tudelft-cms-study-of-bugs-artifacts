I can't get the yaml_utf8 option working properly at all, specifically with `file.directory` or `file.managed`. Unicode characters do work fine for my own custom states, and some other states depending on how they're used. I assembled a [simple repro example](https://github.com/twisty7867/salt-utf-fail).

When using unicode in the state ID declaration, [like so](https://github.com/twisty7867/salt-utf-fail/tree/fb3a3abdb943d0b251d021eb8a012cc4e4ed1402), `vagrant provision` fails while calling `salt-call --local 'state.highstate' (and the state is not applied) with the following traceback:

```

Assigning a bogus ID and moving the Unicode text to `- name:` [like so](https://github.com/twisty7867/salt-utf-fail/tree/53d2b2161424ad93779d037853356345fd6210c5) allows the state to be applied, but then, as described in #16139, the salt fails with the following traceback trying to output:

```

    hstrs.extend([sline.format(**svars) for sline in state_lines])
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 5: ordinal not in range(128)
```

A suggested workaround for this was to use `--out pprint` - which works for the `file.directory` state. However, it doesn't work for other states, like `file.recurse` ([example](https://github.com/twisty7867/salt-utf-fail/tree/5e5ccf1f0d80b244469c72d461f9fd0fca37f838)), which fails internally:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [/opt/répertoire-de-test] at time 17:58:21.882238
[INFO    ] Executing state file.recurse for /opt/répertoire-de-test

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1562, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/file.py", line 2297, in recurse
    dest = os.path.join(name, relname)

    path += '/' + b
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 6: ordinal not in range(128)
```

These fail in the same way whether calling `vagrant provision` or `sudo salt-call --local 'state.highstate'` from within the VM. The same errors occur when using the default Salt supplied by Vagrant (2014.7.5) or when getting v2015.2.0rc2 from git. Based on the notes in #16139, I checked the values of the `LANG` and `LC_ALL` environment variables, both of which are set to `en_US.UTF-8`. Based on the comments in #17227, I tried changing by box to `box-cutter/ubuntu1404`, but got the same results.
