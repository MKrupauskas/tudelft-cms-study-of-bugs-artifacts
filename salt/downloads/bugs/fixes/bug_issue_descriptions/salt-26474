I cannot extract using archive.tar , however it works correctly using normal shell commands.

``` bash
salt-call archive.tar Pxvf /path/to/tar/backup_1439997131.tar.gz -ldebug
```

and i got the same when i did the following:

``` bash
salt-call archive.tar Pxvf /path/to/tar/backup_1439997131.tar.gz dest=/
```

``` python
Passed invalid arguments: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

Currently , i had to pass `sources` as an empty list which is not explained at documentation at the unpacking example, maybe it needs to be updated there ?

I have solved it like this

```
salt-call archive.tar Pxvf /path/to/tar/backup_1439997131.tar.gz sources=[]
```
