```

**OS:** Ubuntu 15.04, using 14.10 Salt packages

When declaring a requisite like

``` SaltStack
include:
  - apache.modules
[â€¦]
  - require_in:
    - sls: apache.modules
```

the state will fail with a message like this:

```
    Cannot extend ID 'apache.modules' in 'base:config'. It is not part of the high state.
This is likely due to a missing include statement or an incorrectly typed ID.
Ensure that a state with an ID of 'apache.modules' is available
in environment 'base' and to SLS 'config'
```

Using just `apache` as include/requisite, everything will work just fine, but once a "sub-SLS" is declared, it will fail as described above.

**EDIT:** A minimal working example:
**foo/bar.sls**

``` SaltStack
some-test-stuff:
  test.succeed_with_changes
```

**config.sls**

``` SaltStack
include:
  - foo.bar

another-test-state:
  test.succeed_with_changes:
    - require_in:
      - sls: foo.bar
```

**Result:**

```
salt-call state.sls config
