The pull in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/3830 is excellent in many things, but I think it's probably going about things the wrong way.  The check on "local" is far to restrictive (it bans relative paths) and it's only there so that the warning about eggnames is suppressed.  And eggnames are not _actually_ required,you just realllllly do want them.  anyway, the check on local isn't good enough.

`salt x pip.install editable=. cwd=/home/blah/source bin_env=/home/blah/venv` should work, but doesn't:

```
sudo salt kkubu pip.install editable=. bin_env=/home/keypit/venv runas=keypit cwd=/home/keypit/source
kkubu:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/minion.py", line 443, in _thread_return
        ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/pip.py", line 269, in install
        raise Exception('You must specify an egg for this editable')
    Exception: You must specify an egg for this editable
```

`salt x pip.install editable=/home/blah/source bin_env=/home/blah/venv` does work
