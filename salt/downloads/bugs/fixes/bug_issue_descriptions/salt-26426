When listing nodes in the nova driver using for example salt-cloud --list-nodes my-nova the private_ips and public_ips have interchanged information.

Looking at the source of the nova driver in the list_nodes function the public and private arrays are populated propery but in the return data the 'private_ips' key is set to the 'public' variable and the 'public_ips' key is set to the 'private' variable.
