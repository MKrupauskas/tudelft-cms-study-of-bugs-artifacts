### Description of Issue/Question
Salt support running from **non-root user**. When I trying to do a `cron.present` state I have to specify a `user` arg, it doesn't make much sense from non-root user but ok, I set it to the same user Salt is running from and state acts weird:

1) It trying to execute cron commands from this user using a `runas` in many functions which doesn't make any sense and won't work in non-root deployment.
2) it fails at 1) yet it somehow updates the user cron
3) It does that in non-idempotent way, so this state always produce a change.

Other observations:
If we look at the function `write_cron_file` in cron module we cant see a strange condition:
```
    if _check_instance_uid_match(user) or __grains__.get('os_family') in ('Solaris', 'AIX'):
        return __salt__['cmd.retcode'](_get_cron_cmdstr(path),
                                       runas=user,
                                       python_shell=False) == 0
    else:
        return __salt__['cmd.retcode'](_get_cron_cmdstr(path, user),
                                       python_shell=False) == 0
``` 
`if _check_instance_uid_match(user)` actually compares the user in state with runtime user of salt and, for some reason, if they're the **same** it decides that it need to do a `runas`. But that makes no sense! If they're the same you can actually just fire the `crontab` command and it will be executed from current user - no need for user switch! 

Kinda the same problem I found a few other functions.

One more thing I'd like to add is that cron module and state doesn't have logging at all so debugging them is very hard.

### Setup
Salt running from non-root user.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Start Salt from non-root user
Apply `cron.present` state for this user.
