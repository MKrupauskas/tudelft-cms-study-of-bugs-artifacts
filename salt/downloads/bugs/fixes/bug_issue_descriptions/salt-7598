@ze42 pointed this issue out in #7577:

Now, an other bug would be if we had something like :

```
$ tar tvf /tmp/piou.tar 
lrwxrwxrwx ze/ze             0 2013-10-03 11:15 link -> /tmp
-rw-r--r-- ze/ze             3 2013-10-03 11:15 link/target
```

Extracting that anywhere with tarfile would write a /tmp/target file.
Using the tar command on my Debian would reject the link/target and not
write in /tmp.
