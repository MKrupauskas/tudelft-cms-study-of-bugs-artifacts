### Description of Issue/Question

If you look at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners/carbon_return.py#L19
the docs say the default is 'text' mode.  However if you dont set a carbon.mode then the returner blows up.
### Setup

Leave carbon.mode out of the minion config or out of a pillar.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Schedule a job with a carbon as the returner.
