### Description of Issue/Question
Tangentially related to #39314, i have a compound match error, which i can and will fix, and i use git-crypt for all secret pillar data, but `ALL` of my pillar data is dumped to syslog on salt-master when this error occurs, which means passwords, private keys for certs etc etc.  
### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
all configs are default overrides in master.d are
