I added a new modules and tried to use it in my pillars.

but as the module isn't available yet in the minion, that fail... normal.

when I wanted to first sync modules, I see that it try to render pillars (I didn't ran refresh_pillar nor sync_all), and it try to render states top.sls which, in my case, depends on pillar data.
