### Description of Issue/Question

Related to #35869 but slightly different. timezone.system fails when /etc/localtime is missing on FreeBSD.


### Setup
FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE-p1
Salt: 2017.7.1

```
Australia/Sydney:
  timezone.system:
    - name: Australia/Sydney
```

Output:
```
          ID: Australia/Sydney
    Function: timezone.system
      Result: False
     Comment: Unable to compare desired timezone 'Australia/Sydney' to system timezone: Failed to read /etc/localtime to determine current timezone: No such file or directory
     Started: 04:12:12.728588
    Duration: 0.757 ms
```

On the minion

```
ls -al /etc/localtime
ls: /etc/localtime: No such file or directory
```
