**Description**

`mysql_database.present` logic doesn't check if it was run in test mode for charset mismatch logic.

You can see it here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v3001/salt/states/mysql_database.py#L73-L76

It will try to do an ALTER even if you run it in test mode.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

1. Create a Mysql database with different charset than the `mysql_database.present`  expects
2. Run the state with test=True

**Expected behavior**
No changes should be made. A comment about the charset mismatch should be returned.

Affects both 3000.x and 3001.x
