### Description of Issue/Question

If the bootstrap script fails while provisioning a new VM with salt-cloud and libvirt provider, it may leave a broken VM around (depending on the libvirt version).

### Setup

salt 2017.7.2, libvirt-3.2.1.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

In my case I pre-installed the fedora 26 salt 2017.7.2 in the base vm, the bootstrap script then tries to install salt via a COPR repository, which fails on a RPM conflict between yum-utils and dnf-utils.

This left behind a VM without disks attached, due to the way the cleanup of leftover disks/VM's works. This used to work with older libvirt versions (I think).

/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/local-kvm.conf
```
local-kvm:
  driver: libvirt
  url: qemu:///system
```
/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/fedora.conf
```
f26:
  provider: local-kvm
  base_domain: base-f26
  ip_source: qemu-agent
  ssh_username: root
  password: ..........
  clone_strategy: quick
  deploy_command: sh /tmp/.saltcloud/deploy.sh
  script_args: -F -r
```
