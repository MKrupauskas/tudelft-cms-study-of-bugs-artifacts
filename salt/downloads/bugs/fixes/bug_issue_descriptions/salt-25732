A simple state run fails on standard Centos 6.6 with the following error

```
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/output/__init__.py", line 39, in try_printout
    return get_printout(out, opts)(data).rstrip()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/output/highstate.py", line 85, in output
    return _format_host(host, hostdata)[0]
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/output/highstate.py", line 378, in _format_host
    '{:.3f}'.format(sum_duration).rjust(9 - len(duration_unit)),
ValueError: zero length field name in format
```

I believe this is because the {:.3f} has no positional arg, which is fine for python >=2.7, but  not so good for python 2.6 (which is the default version on RHEL/Centos 6).
