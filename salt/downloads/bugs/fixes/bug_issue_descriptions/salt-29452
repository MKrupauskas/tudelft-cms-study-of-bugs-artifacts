Running into this issue occasionally:

```
Exception occurred in runner provserv.create: Traceback (most recent call last):

```

'provserv.create' is our own custom runner.  This has also been happening in some of the other functions in the runner.  It doesn't happen all the time - just occasionally - even when running with the same data.  May be related to #29123, as we are also using the **opts** dunder.
