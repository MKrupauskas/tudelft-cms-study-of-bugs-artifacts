I have a strange issue with a tool (vagrant) that sets pillars with the pillar='<JSON>' command line option. I wanted to pass in an ssh-key as pillar data using the command line. The key consists of '\n' characters which seem to cause the state.highstate running in test=True mode. Setting test=False results in a message that test has been already set. State changes are in "yellow" and won't be applied.

Running the same command line just with --pillar='<JSON>' and the same pillar data is executing the highstate but doesn't set the pillar data at all

I'm confused, according to the documentation, "pillar" and not "--pillar" should be the correct option to go.
