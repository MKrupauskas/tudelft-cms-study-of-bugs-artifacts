When e.g. a user's fullname contains non-ascii characters, an exception is raised. In case of the fullname field, the exception is caused here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/user.py#L308

The _str()_ method tries to convert the unicode string to ascii, which obviously fails.
I've replaced this with _fullname.encode('utf-8')_; this worked fine.

However, I'm not sure if fullname is always a unicode, or if there are conditions when it's a non-unicode string.
