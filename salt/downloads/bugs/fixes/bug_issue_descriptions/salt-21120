At first, @s0undt3ch & @thatch45 i would be happy that the highstate behavior stay in the form as @s0undt3ch just commited, with the warnings summary, it's awsome.

Now, i have spurious warnings, from time to time, where i dont have those 'fun' & 'state' kwargs, i dont understand from where they are injected and throw the warnings:

```
ID: npm-version-0_10_36auto
Function: archive.extracted
Name: /srv/apps/node/0.10.36
Result: True
Comment: /srv/apps/node/0.10.36/bin/.node_0.10.36 already exists
Started: 17:54:00.978127
Duration: 0.643 ms
Changes:   
Warnings: 'fun' and 'state' are invalid keyword arguments for
          'archive.extracted'. If you were trying to pass additional data to
          be used in a template context, please populate 'context' with
          'key: value' pairs. Your approach will work until Salt Carbon is
          out. Please update your state files.
