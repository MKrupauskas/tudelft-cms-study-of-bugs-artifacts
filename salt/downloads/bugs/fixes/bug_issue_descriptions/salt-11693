I have a problem with a reactor firing of a runner only once. 
If I restart the salt master, I can get the reactor to work once. 
If I try a second time without restarting, the reactor never fires.
However a message is received on the message bus. 

On the minion, I fire a message:

```
sudo salt-call event.fire_master 'Deploy' 'deploy/qa'
```

On the master I receive a message:

```
*************************
Tag: deploy/qa
Data:
{'_stamp': '2014-04-01_05:31:59.939744',
 'cmd': '_minion_event',
 'data': 'Deploy',
 'id': 'build',
 'tag': 'deploy/qa'}
Event fired at Tue Apr  1 05:32:01 2014 
*************************
```

After the first run, I get this error:

```
Exception AttributeError: "'ReqServer' object has no attribute 'work_procs'" in <bound method ReqServer.__del__ of <salt.master.ReqServer object at 0x16a7310>> ignored
Exception TypeError: 'an integer is required' in <bound method SaltEvent.__del__ of <salt.utils.event.SaltEvent object at 0x1008d10>> ignored
```

On the master I can run salt-run several time without any issues. 

```
salt-run mydeploy.deploy qa
```

Another observation is that even though I can see the event fired on the eventlistener, there is no attempt by the master to take action. 
There is no output while running "salt-master -l debug"

When running: salt-run mydeploy.deploy qa
I see that the runner is doing what it supposed to.

The reactor conf, the state file and the sample code can be found at:

The runner is actually more complicated than the example.
