There seems to be a bug in 2015.8.1 with pkg.installed when there is a "-" in the name of the source package key. For example 

``` salt
aspera-pkg:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - aspera-scp-p2p: salt://aspera/files/aspera-scp-p2p-3.5-linux-64.rpm
```

``` yaml
----------
ID: aspera-pkg
Function: pkg.installed
Result: False
Comment: Unable to cache salt://aspera/files/aspera-scp-p2p-3.5-linux-64.rpm: file not found
Started: 16:29:40.219177

My understanding is that the problem is with this line:

```
      - aspera-scp-p2p: salt://aspera/files/aspera-scp-p2p-3.5-linux-64.rpm
```

because of the '-' in the key.

Thanks!
