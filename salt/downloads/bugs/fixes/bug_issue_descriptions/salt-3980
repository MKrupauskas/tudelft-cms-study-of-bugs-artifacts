The following compound matcher rules no longer work in 0.13.1. They worked fine on 0.11.x.

```
'not mail.smidsrod.no'
'E@(server|core|ubuntuvm|hp)\.smidsrod\.lan or apache.smidsrod.no'
'E@(server|pf)\.smidsrod\.lan'
```

I found the regexp `[^\s()]+|[()]` on line 1115 of salt/minion.py to split the tokens. That seems a bit naive considering you've got PCRE as one of your tokens, which can be wildly complex.

I don't know python, but I ran the second string through that regexp (using perl) and it does seem to split it up a bit strangely.

```
$ perl -E '$v="E@(server|core|ubuntuvm|hp)\.smidsrod\.lan or apache.smidsrod.no"; say join(";", $v =~ /[^\s()]+|[()]/g);'
E@;(;server|core|ubuntuvm|hp;);.smidsrod.lan;or;apache.smidsrod.no
```

I would've expected this to split into `E@(server|core|ubuntuvm|hp).smidsrod.lan;or;apache.smidsrod.no`.

This is the traceback I get when running state.highstate with this compound matcher in my top.sls file:
