This on 2014.7.0

I've noticed the following on two occasions, but haven't had the time to investigate this further when it occurred. (It only happened twice, on the exact same appliances, with the exact same states which normally work fine, so it certainly looks like some kind of race condition.)

When looking at "ps aux" output the last time this occurred I noted two salt-ssh lines, one of which was defunct. Killing the other made the salt-ssh stop hanging. (And exit with non-0 exit code.)

This is the traceback, the first one is where it hangs (and comes from salt-ssh), the second doesn't appear until you kill the process (and is from my code, not from salt):
