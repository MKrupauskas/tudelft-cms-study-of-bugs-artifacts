Hi,

I'm trying to get my custom grains working, but this seems not to work.

Custom grain:

```
def prodenv_code_is_write_protected():
    """if code is read only or mapped through vagrant into system return True"""
    return {"prodenv_code_is_write_protected": True}
```

State file:

```
{% if not grains['prodenv_code_is_write_protected'] %}
test:
  cmd.run:
    - name: {{grains['prodenv_code_is_write_protected']}}
{% endif %}
```

when executing this state remotely from a master, i see in the log file the state file beeing randered like this:

```
test:
  cmd.run:
    - name: False
```

when exectuing this state locally on the minion by calling `salt-call state.sls ...` it is working fine...

and if I request the grain by calling `salt-run grains.get prodenv_code_is_write_protected` i also get `False` and when calling it localy i get `True`.

I'm not sure whats happening here.
