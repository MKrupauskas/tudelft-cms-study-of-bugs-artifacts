I created 2 custom modules and when trying to import parts from one of them, I get ImportError

```
2014-10-10 16:29:38,652 [salt.loader      ][DEBUG   ] Failed to import module collection, this is most likely NOT a problem:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 911, in load_modules
    ), fn_, path, desc
  File "/var/cache/salt/extmods/modules/collection.py", line 1, in <module>
    from salt.modules.patterns import *
ImportError: No module named patterns
```

Module functions are not accessible.

This bug recently appeared with a pull from git (salt 2014.7.0-792-g91f3326), it used to work with a previous commit (salt 2014.7.0-291-gfbc61d2). Custom modules didn't changed after the pull.
