Noticing this issue where the service wouldn't restart when the file was changed by file.replace. 

Didn't see anything in documentation about this not working - can someone clarify? 

SLS file below:

``` yaml
nginx:
  pkg:
    - installed

  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
    - reload: True

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:
  file:
    - replace
    - pattern: '#? server_names_hash_bucket_size (\d+);'
    - repl: 'server_names_hash_bucket_size 128;'
    - watch_in:
      - service: nginx

```

Putting the `watch:` in `nginx.service` gives same error. 

Error On Salt Master:
