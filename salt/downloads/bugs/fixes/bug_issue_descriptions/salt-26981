A file download performed within a state (eg. state.file.managed, or state.archive.extracted using the source: and source_hash: arguments ) does not work as the (md5) hashvalue seems to be incorrectly determined.
### Steps to reproduce
1. in a state file include the following state. (The link provided is a working link)

``` yaml
/tmp/readme.txt:
  file.managed:
    - source: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht8bc41amrd36re/readme.txt
    - source_hash: md5=5126701b2af70565807f329f087490ca
```
1. verify the md5 is correct by performing a `wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/ht8bc41amrd36re/readme.txt && md5sum readme.txt`
2. execute the state.highstate command in the minion. 
3. check the logs. mine:

1. run the state the second time (without updating the source_hash value of the state)

### sanity checks
- downloading the file from a webserver (served static file through apache) works
### acknowledgements

Want to acknowledge the #salt irc group (especially babilen and AndreaLutro) to help determine this problem.
### possible solutions (or evasions)
- bypass hashchecking (because downloaded file from known and controlled source)
