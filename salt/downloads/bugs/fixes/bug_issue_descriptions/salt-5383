the following does not work on my servers (salt-0.15.1).
this is the substituted sls from debug log:

<pre>
# TODO: THIS SEEMS TO BE BUGGY
# revoke permission for the following ex-employees:

ssh_auth_dev1:
  ssh_auth:
    - absent
    - user: rails
    - source: salt://users/files/authorized_keys.dev1

ssh_auth_dev2:
  ssh_auth:
    - absent
    - user: rails
    - source: salt://users/files/authorized_keys.dev2

</pre>


<pre>

    Name:      ssh_auth_dev1
    Function:  absent
        Result:    True

keys are still present in ~rails/.ssh/authorized_keys.
each salt://users/files/authorized_keys.dev\* file contains two keys (full lines including comment)
