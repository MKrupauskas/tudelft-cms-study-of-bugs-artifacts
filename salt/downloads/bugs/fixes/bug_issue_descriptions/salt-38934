`beacon.present` only works with built-in beacons, and is not able to load custom beacons found in `_beacons`. 
I created a custom beacon to read the memory usage of a host, I put it `_beacons` restart both the minion and the master, and I got the following error:

```
 salt "m*1*" state.sls_id config_becons bootstrap                     
minion1.local:
----------
          ID: beacons_bla
    Function: beacon.present
        Name: memory
      Result: False
     Comment: Beacon memory does not exist
     Started: 10:56:00.240625
    Duration: 86.418 ms
     Changes:   

Summary for minion1.local
------------
Succeeded: 0
Failed:    1
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:  86.418 ms
```

The config beacons id is:
```
config_beacons:
  beacon.present:
    - enable: True
    - name: memory
```

Again the problem is solved if I put the following in `/etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf`:
```
beacons:
  memory:
   - interval: 10

```
