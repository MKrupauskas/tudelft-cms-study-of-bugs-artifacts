On an ubuntu, when using c6-x86_64-20130910-1.qcow2 from http://wiki.centos.org/Cloud/OpenNebula (as suggested by the documentation). 

I get 

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'mount -o defaults /dev/nbd7p2 /tmp/nbd/nbd7/nbd7p2 ' failed with return code: 32
[ERROR   ] stderr: mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'
```

I'm not sure if this a bug or a weird setup, but the "manual" fix is to use bits of LVM commands such as found in http://www.linux-sxs.org/storage/fedora2ubuntu.html

Again, no error message is displayed on the host. The machine appears in libvirt but not started.
