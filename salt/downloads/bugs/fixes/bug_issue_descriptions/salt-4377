I tried to use the module reg to manage windows registry. But maybe there are something wrong with this module, here is an example:
When I trying to create a key in the path **"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\salt"** , I'd like to use reg module like this:

```
salt '*' reg.create_key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE' 'SOFTWARE\salt' 'test_key' 'test_value'
```

If you tried this command, you will see that such command will create a new path **"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\salt\test_key"**, and the key you want to create will be stored in this path, why? I do not want to create a new path...

My salt master version is 0.13.3 and the minion version is 0.14.0.
