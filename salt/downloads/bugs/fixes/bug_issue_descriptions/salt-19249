Hi guys!

I have configured salt-master with next parameter:

```
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt
```

I have created next directory on my machine: _/srv/salt/common_

This directory contains next states (only important here):
_/srv/salt/common/init.sls_

```
include:
  - common.data_helper
  - common.repos
```

_/srv/salt/common/data_helper.sls_

```
save_hosts_data:
  module.run:
    - name: common_nodehelper.nodes_net
```

_/srv/salt/common/repos.sls_

```
/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://common/repos/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6
    - mode: 644
    - user: root
```

Then I have created in _/srv/salt_ directory next file: _/srv/salt/deploy.sls_

```
include:
  - common
```

So I use this via salt orchestrate module:
`salt-run state.orch deploy`

It works fine. But once I have found one interesting exception:
_Installation log_

```
comment: "Run failed on minions: min1

    qa137:

      Name: /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6 - Function: file.managed - Result: Failed

```

_salt-master log_

```
2014-12-08 18:42:10,787 [salt.master                                 ][ERROR   ] Error in function _file_hash:

    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 17] File exists: '/var/cache/salt/master/roots/hash/base/common/repos'
```

Now I cannot repeat this anymore. It appears only one time. I think this is because of the race in salt stack. It cannot create _cache_dir_ sometimes.

I have next SaltStack version:

```
# salt --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.1.4
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jan 22 2014, 09:42:36)

         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 14.3.1

Looking forward to hearing from you.
Happy Christmas!
Thank you in advance!
