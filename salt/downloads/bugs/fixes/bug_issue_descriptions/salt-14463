I am setting up states to control how nginx runs on my system.  I have an architecture like:

```
top.sls:
```

```
      static:
          '192.168.96.0/24'
          - match: ipcidr
          - srv.web.static
```

```
srv/web/static.sls:
```

```
      include: srv.web.nginx

      /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/com.domain.a:
        file.managed:
          - source: salt://srv/web/static/nginx/com.domain.a
          - require:
            - pkg: nginx
          - etc: ...
```

```
srv/web/nginx.sls:
```

```
      nginx:
        pkg:
          - installed
        service:
          - running
          - require:
           - pkg: nginx
          - watch:
            - file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
            - file: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*
            - method: reload
```

The intention is that my `com.domain.a` file gets put in to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`, and then nginx gets reloaded, so that nginx starts serving up the domain.  But this isn't happening.  The file gets included in the directory, but nginx isn't getting reloaded.

`/var/log/salt/minion` shows no errors.  I have read the documentation.  It seems to me that this should be working.

Is this expected behavior?  If so, how should I proceed?
