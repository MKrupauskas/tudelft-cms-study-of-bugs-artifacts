### Description of Issue/Question

If you have a mac_service agent and daemon with the same Label name salt will not be able to notice the agent as the list of available services is kept in a dictionary with the label name as the key. Since the Daemons are processed after the Agents the Daemon overwrites the agent. 

Just making this issue to make it visible to others.

@Ch3LL Thinking about changing the services to be stored with file_path as the main identifier key. Thoughts?
