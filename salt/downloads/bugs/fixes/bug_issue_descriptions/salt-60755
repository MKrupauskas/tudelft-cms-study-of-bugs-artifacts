### Description of Issue
I am running an inotify beacon that looks for file changes and which calls an orchestration that sends me an email when a file is changed. Looking at the journal for salt-minion, I see multiple repeated exceptions.

I am also having some event loops where a beacon detects that the SSHd config changed, then calls an orchestration which highstates the minion and sends me an email. This beacon seems to get stuck in loops where it will detect a change, highstates, and does it again until the minion service is restarted. The beacon sls does set disable_during_state_run as True. This looping problem may not be related to this issue except that it causes these exceptions - the exception occurs when the file is changed.

### Setup: Minion beacons.conf

### Setup: salt-minion Journal
Hundreds of these exceptions can be called at once.

    beacon_name = config.get("_beacon_name", "inotify")

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
The exceptions and looping occur when the SSHd config file is modified. It also is likely to occur when other files are modified, though I have not confirmed this.
