The main problem comes from 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/file.py#L962-964

<pre>
for line in fileinput.input(path,
            inplace=not dry_run, backup=False if dry_run else backup,
            bufsize=bufsize, mode='rb'):
</pre>


Using `salt.states.file.replace` with `flags:  ['DOTALL', 'MULTILINE']`, `bufsize: 'file'` and a pattern like `pattern: start.*end` it is impossible to match any multi-lines as `fileinput.input` is always reading the file line by line, even with bufsize set to the file size.

It seems that fileinput is made for that (http://docs.python.org/2/library/fileinput.html), a line by line read.

Documentation of `salt.modules.file.replace` states:

> Note: multiline searches must specify file as the bufsize argument below.

But this is not enough.
