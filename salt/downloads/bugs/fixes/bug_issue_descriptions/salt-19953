If redhat-lsb-core package is installed, then /etc/lsb-release is populated with:

```
LSB_VERSION=base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-ia32:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-ia32:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-ia32:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-ia32:printing-4.0-noarch
```

In core grains, if this file exists then there's a regex to identify id, release, codename and description. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/grains/core.py#L992

These aren't available so the grains aren't populated. If /etc/lsb-release doesn't exist, then /etc/{redhat,centos}-release is parsed for this same information, and the grains are populated correctly.
