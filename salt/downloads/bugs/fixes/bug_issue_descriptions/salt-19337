This is not a new issue #3846 but it seems this keeps regressing so here some more details:
#### Setup and rationale

I have multiple cloud accounts (AWS) with syndics all managed from a single master on corporate premises. For stupid reasons our IT team refuses to set up a proper VPN so instead I use ssh to build a tunnel from on-premise to the syndics like so:

```
# Note: this requires setting GatewayPorts: clientspecified in sshd_config on the remote machine
ssh -R 4505:127.0.0.2:4505 -R 4506:127.0.0.2:4506 syndic 
```

Using 127.0.0.2 solves two related problems:
- it is possible to set the RET port for the minion but there does not seem to be a way to set the PUB port, which means the "master" needs to be on a separate IP. 
- the syndic-master can still listen on the local interface 127.0.0.1

This setup works just fine in 2014.1 but fails in 2014.7 and 2015.2. #3846 suggests that this might be because the "interfaces" setting is not properly honored. As per my comment in #3846 I don't have a good way of testing this.
#### Validation and regression tests

What I did test is the behavior of minion/syndic where the master-master is 2014.7 (EPEL 2014.7.0-3) with different syndic versions directly from github:
##### 2014.1 @ 67e5bfd

minion works, syndic works
##### 2014.7 @ 0679522

minion works, syndic does not. See my comments in #3846 for details of the timeout messages the syndic creates. I have validated that the Syndic and not the MultiSyndic module is used.
##### develop @ 0452b43

minon works, syndic fails, similar to 2014.7
##### 2015.2 @ 05089e1

minion works, syndic blows up:
