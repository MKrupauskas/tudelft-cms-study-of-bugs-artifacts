**Description**

Initially discussed this in the [Slack `#develop` channel](https://saltstackcommunity.slack.com/archives/C8832QN4U/p1650315109364589) -- CC: @nicholasmhughes.

Running the formulas' group weekly testing with the latest `master` branch images, I encountered failures across all instances in the `prometheus-formula`:

* https://gitlab.com/myii/prometheus-formula/-/pipelines/519012370

My initial findings highlighted an issue with the `archive.extracted` state:

```sls
          ID: prometheus-archive-install-prometheus
    Function: archive.extracted
        Name: /opt/prometheus/prometheus-v2.22.1
      Result: False
     Comment: All files in archive are already present
              
              While trying to enforce user/group ownership, the following paths were missing:
              
              - /opt/prometheus/prometheus-v2.22.1/console/
```

I looked back over the changes introduced over the last week and established that the regression was introduced in 3bab5bdd3f2cb1767bd8264374d665baed5f5049 (#61896), in the `archive.list` execution module function.

Reverting that commit got the state working; in fact, the whole Test Kitchen suite was passing again.

Using interactive debugging with `pudb`, I was able to trace through what was going on.

Before the recent commit:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/e8efcedcfdcc851b348df7bcdfa1834ee243fc83/salt/modules/archive.py#L428

These are the values that would be involved:

```py
>>> ret["dirs"]
['console_libraries/', 'consoles/']

>>> [x for x in ret["dirs"] if x.count("/") == 1]  # i.e. `ret["top_level_dirs"]`
['console_libraries/', 'consoles/']
```

After the recent commit:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/08cf17cd807661b9872d27abde604b07631048c8/salt/modules/archive.py#L428-L436

Tracing through the values assigned:

```py
>>> top_level_dirs
['console_libraries/', 'consoles/']

>>> common_prefix
'console'

>>> common_prefix
'console/'

>>> top_level_dirs
['console_libraries/', 'consoles/', 'console/']
```

Essentially, `common_prefix` is wrongly evaluated right at the beginning of this block, leading to the erroneous value `'console/'` being added to `top_level_dirs`.

So we need to ensure that `common_prefix` matching only occurs if a directory name is identified, not just a partial match.

**Setup**
* The Test Kitchen setup in the current release of the `prometheus-formula`, i.e.:
  - https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/prometheus-formula/releases/tag/v5.6.4

- [ ] on-prem machine
- [ ] VM (Virtualbox, KVM, etc. please specify)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [X] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
    - https://hub.docker.com/r/saltimages/salt-master-py3/tags
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD
  
---

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
* Clone the formula using the tag above.
* Run Kitchen for any of the `master` instances (the `default` suite), e.g.:
  - `bin/kitchen test default-debian-10-master-py3`
  - Important: As mentioned below, I've already tested and pushed a fix to these `master` images in Docker Hub, so these will now pass.

---

**Expected behavior**
The CI testing should pass, as it has been doing every week until last week:

* https://gitlab.com/myii/prometheus-formula/-/pipelines/513882486

**Versions Report**
Affects all current `master` branch installations.

**Additional context**
Referring to the test added in #61896:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/08cf17cd807661b9872d27abde604b07631048c8/tests/pytests/functional/modules/test_archive.py#L308-L333

I've written a failing test based on the situation in the `prometheus-formula`:

```py
@pytest.mark.skip_on_windows
@pytest.mark.skip_if_binaries_missing("tar")
def test_tar_list_with_similar_top_level_dirs(archive, tmp_path):
    rel_paths = (
        "archive_top/second_level/file.txt",
        "archives/second_level/file.txt",
    )

    for rel_path in rel_paths:
        srcfile = tmp_path / str(pathlib.Path(rel_path))
        srcfile.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        srcfile.write_text("hey there")

    archive.tar(
        "-cvzf",
        str(tmp_path / "tld_test.tar.gz"),
        sources=["archive_top", "archives"],
        cwd=str(tmp_path),
    )

    expected = {
        "dirs": [
            "archive_top/",
            "archive_top/second_level/",
            "archives/",
            "archives/second_level/",
        ],
        "files": [
            "archive_top/second_level/file.txt",
            "archives/second_level/file.txt",
        ],
        "links": [],
        "top_level_dirs": ["archive_top/", "archives/"],
        "top_level_files": [],
        "top_level_links": [],
    }
    ret = archive.list(
        str(tmp_path / "tld_test.tar.gz"), archive_format="tar", verbose=True
    )
    assert ret == expected
```

Using the above, I've prepared a single-line fix that I've already pushed to the `master` images in Docker Hub, resulting in the `prometheus-formula` CI passing again:

* https://gitlab.com/myii/prometheus-formula/-/pipelines/519496855

I'll submit that in a PR shortly.
