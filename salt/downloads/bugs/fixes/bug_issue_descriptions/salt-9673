After this issue experienced once, any attempts to sync state of the machine, by either calling 'salt' on the master or calling 'salt-call' locally on the minion, will fail with the same exception. 

Deleting cache files in the location 'C:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\proc' allows to sync states using either master 'salt' or local 'salt-call'.
