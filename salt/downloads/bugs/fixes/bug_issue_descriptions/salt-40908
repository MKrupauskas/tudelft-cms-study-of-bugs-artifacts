### Description of Issue/Question

If master_port is encoded in YAML as a string, the socket connection in salt.utils.dns_check will fail. This was not the case in previous versions. It also appears that a previous version of salt-cloud (or salt-bootstrap) was responsible for generating minion configs with the port encoded as a string.

See https://github.com/nicksloan/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/__init__.py#L517

The original exception provides useful context that is stripped away in the SaltSystemExit error. I was not able to determine the cause of the error [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2016.11.4/salt/minion.py#L177) without modifying the code to view the original exception. That's hardly ideal.

Here are a few ideas:
- Improve the error message so that the user can identify the port being a string as the piece that is broken.
- Reintroduce the behavior that allowed this to work previously. It may be as simple as wrapping the port argument with `int` in the `socket.connect` call. It may be wise to do the previous suggestion as a warning as well.

I'm happy to work on a pull request here, but want advice on how to best address this.

### Setup

Specify `master_port: '4506'` in your minion config.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Do anything.
