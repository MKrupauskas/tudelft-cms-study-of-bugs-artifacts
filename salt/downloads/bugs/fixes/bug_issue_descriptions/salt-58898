**Description**
Trying to get the GitFS backend to work keeps resulting in this error:
```
2020-11-06 15:15:37,245 [salt.utils.gitfs :1888][ERROR   ][42996] Error occurred fetching gitfs remote 'git@github.com:<USER>/<REPO>.git': Failed to authenticate SSH session: Unable to send userauth-publickey request
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/gitfs.py", line 1864, in _fetch
    fetch_results = origin.fetch(**fetch_kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pygit2/remote.py", line 423, in fetch
    check_error(err)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pygit2/errors.py", line 61, in check_error
    raise GitError(message)
_pygit2.GitError: Failed to authenticate SSH session: Unable to send userauth-publickey request
```
It takes quite long for the authentication to fail, so I suspect a timeout is reached.

**Setup**
Configuration
```yaml
fileserver_backend:
  - roots
  - git

file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/pillar

gitfs_base: main

gitfs_remotes:
  - git@github.com:<USER>/<REPO>.git:
    - pubkey: /<PATH>/ssh-git-ro.pub
    - privkey: /<PATH>/ssh-git-ro
```
The SSH key is added as a Deploy Key to the Git repository.
Also tried:
- SSH key as key for user
- 4096 bit SSH key
- 3072 bit SSH key
- chmod 777 on SSH key (+pub)
- removing trailing whitespace from private key

All the attempts resulted in the same error. I am able to do a 'git clone' manually of the repository.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Installation is done through `apt-get` using the instructions [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/ubuntu.html).
Installed `python3-pygit2` package through `apt-get`

After setting up the master (and a minion) with the above config. 
Create a new GitHub repository with a `top.sls` file on the `main` branch.
Generate an SSH key and add the SSH key as a Deploy Key to the GitHub repository.

Run as root:
```
salt-run cache.clear_git_lock gitfs type=update

salt-run -l debug fileserver.update
```

**Expected behavior**
The command succeeds
