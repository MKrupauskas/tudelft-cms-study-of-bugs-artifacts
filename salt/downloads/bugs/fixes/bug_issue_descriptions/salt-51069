### Description of Issue/Question

It appears that the `--no-rdoc` and `--no-ri` options have been entirely removed from gem. This means that if you leave `rdoc` and `ri` options blank the default of False no longer works because those aren't options any more.

If you set them both to true then it's ok because the `--no` options are removed from the cmd line execution & gem.installed works fine.

I routinely update the system gems for ruby, so this is probably something which doesn't occur mainstream unless you do that, in particular I think it's a rubygems > 3 issue (perhaps)

If not:
