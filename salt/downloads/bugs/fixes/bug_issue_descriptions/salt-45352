This is a breakdown in the type checking code in `salt/config/__init__.py`. It's not causing a problem, other than being confusing, but should still be fixed.

```
[WARNING ] Key 'saltenv' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a  or basestring is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'signing_key_pass' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a  or basestring is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'state_top_saltenv' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a  or basestring is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'log_level_logfile' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a  or basestring is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'key_pass' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a  or basestring is required for this value
