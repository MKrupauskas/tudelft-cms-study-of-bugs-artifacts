### Description of Issue/Question

Much like the unicode error That happened in #44452. 
.format does not like when unicode is put through it's variables. 

For that reason if unicode is in any of the variables between 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2017.7.5/salt/utils/templates.py#L456-L460

You will end up with a unicode error, instead of the actual error produced. even if not useing debug. 

### Setup
Use a template that will be rendered and has unicode, and get jinja to throw an error that isn't caught through the other catches.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
This is based on observation. Have not found a way to trip the exception everytime that gets to that point. but have seen .format throw unicode exceptions in much the same way before.
