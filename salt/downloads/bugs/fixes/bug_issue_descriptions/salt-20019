I am unable to apply my states via salt-ssh because I get an exception. I've traced it back to a `_modules` directory inside one of my formulas being served by gitfs.

if I remove the offending formula from the git file roots, the problem goes away. I was able to extract its contents into `/srv/salt` and apply my states so it seems to be isolated to gitfs?

```
$ /usr/bin/salt-ssh -l debug --wipe vagrant state.sls test test=True 
<snipped>
[DEBUG   ] Results of YAML rendering:
<snipped>
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** skipped ** latest already in cache 'salt://test/files/test.sh'
vagrant:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.sls: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/var/cache/salt/master/gitfs/refs/base/_modules'
```

After a trip around the world, the exception is raised inside salt.utils.fopen on [this line](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.7.0/salt/fileserver/gitfs.py#L1220).

I also see this error in the logs: `[WARNING ] Found invalid hash file [_modules.lk] when attempting to reap cache directory.`

Clearing the cache has no effect.
