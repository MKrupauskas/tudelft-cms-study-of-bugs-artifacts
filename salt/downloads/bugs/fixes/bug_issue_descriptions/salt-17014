I'm trying to use the salt-ssh transport system with the orchestrate runner, here's an extract of the configuration file used :

```
remote_host:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'dbserv'
    - ssh: 'true'
    - sls:
      - exploit.stop
```

The orchestrate runner is executed with :

```
 salt-run state.orchestrate stop_all
```

And it raises the following error : 

```
 Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1382, in call
              **cdata['kwargs'])
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/saltmod.py", line 150, in state
              if mdata['out'] != 'highstate':
          KeyError: 'out'
```

After some debugging, I found the data returned by the minion looks like :

```
{'cmd_| <...> 'result': True}}
```

While the same operation with a standard communication returns an additional dictionnary level with the two keys 'ret' and 'out' :

```
{'ret': {'cmd_| <...> 'result': True}}, 'out': 'highstate'}
```

I don't know if this behaviour of the salt-ssh transport system is normal, but I made a patch to get around this issue : 82e9590dc0719716cd2652556b6283a77122b889

Tested with version 2014.1.13, after application of the correction from issue #14981. Unfortunately, I could not test this with v2014.7.0 for the moment.
