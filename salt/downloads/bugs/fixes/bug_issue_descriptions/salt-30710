In the case where a user is using `salt-call` to communicate with a master, some minion-specific configuration values are ignored if they are not set on the master.

For example, in a case where a user set `state_aggregate: True`  in a minion config but does not have that option set on the master, the option will be completely ignored by salt-call if not running with `--local`.

This appears it may be a bug in options generation in the `__gen_opts` function in `salt.state`.
