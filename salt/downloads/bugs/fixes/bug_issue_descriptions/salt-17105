Due to [this change](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/software-properties/main/revision/904#softwareproperties/ppa.py) in python-software-properties, the `expand_ppa_line` function which the pkgrepo module uses no longer works.

I don't know if this was done by accident, since I see no mention of it in the commit or any changelog, but since it breaks BC this way it's not very good.

Either way, I'll leave this here so this issue can be resolved, be it here or there.
