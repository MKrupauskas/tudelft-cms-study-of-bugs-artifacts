The docker-io state does not work with Docker 0.11.1 on CentOS (and probably RHEL) 7.

sls:

```
redis.pulled:
  docker.pulled:
    - name: redis
    - tag: latest
```

output:

```
[root@test salt]# vi test.sls 
[root@test salt]# salt-call state.sls test

Docker 0.11.1 (22.el7.centos)
salt-minion 2014.1.10
docker-py 0.4 & 0.3.2 (tried both with no success)

It works on the same box by using Docker 1.0.0 from EPEL, however this package has been removed recently (in favor of the distribution package).
