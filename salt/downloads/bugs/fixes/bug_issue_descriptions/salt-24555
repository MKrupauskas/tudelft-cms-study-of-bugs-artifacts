#8261 (or something else) seems to have implemented some code that says if a service.enabled appears, delete the .override

This causes thrash and lack of idempotency because I'm trying to `file.managed` an override file for a `service.enabled` service.

No matter which way I order these 2 states will never come back clean because service.enabled ensures the override is absent and the file.managed creates it.

``` yaml
ensure_salt_service_autostart:
  service:
    - enabled
    - name: salt-minion

salt_start_on_override:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://delay_salt_run/salt-minion.override
    - name: /etc/init/salt-minion.override

# Results in this (repeatedly)
  Name: salt-minion - Function: service.enabled - Result: Changed
  Name: /etc/init/salt-minion.override - Function: file.managed - Result: Changed
```

Salt master:

``` yaml

I am working around just by implementing my override file management after the service.  I'm just pointing out the thrash as bad.
