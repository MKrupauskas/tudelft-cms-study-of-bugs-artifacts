I think there are few problems in code for generating locale, especially in localemod.py on lines 205-210

``` __salt__['file.replace'](
'/etc/locale.gen',
'# {0} '.format(locale),
'{0} '.format(locale),
append_if_not_found=True
)
```

first is the append_if_not_found=True, according to documentation function takes argument int format 'en_US.UTF-8', however /etc/locale.gen has locales listed in format like 'en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8', and appending incorrect format locale in file results invalid locale.gen file and generation of such locale fails

second problem (I may be wrong) is that match string and replace string have spaces at the end, however, when I have tried to run file.replace with such conditions (with salt 2014.7) result was incorrect, because the space was removed, example:
I run salt minion `file.replace '# en_US.UTF-8 ' 'en_US.UTF-8 '` on file containing line `# en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and result was `en_US.UTF-8UTF-8` (the space between en_US.UTF-8 and UTF-8 was missing)
