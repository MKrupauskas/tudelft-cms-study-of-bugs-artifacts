In the latest version of Salt 2014.7.1, the config_option is required to be set to True to launch instances in Rackspace using salt-cloud. The error without that option is:

```
    ----------
    Error:
        Error creating rax-openstack-controller on OpenStack

        The following exception was thrown by libcloud when trying to run the initial deployment: 400 Bad Request Invalid config_drive provided.
```

My cloud.providers file:

```
rackspace:

  compute_name: cloudServersOpenStack
