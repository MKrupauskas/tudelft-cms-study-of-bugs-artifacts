Nitrogen - error when running state containing an pkg.installed of an .rpm. This is from our SSE install states.

This is the command we run: `salt-call state.apply eAPI`

Here is the error:
```
[ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

Here is the same error within the state output:

This is the section in the state that is failing:
```
install-deps:
  pkg.installed:
    - refresh: True
    - sources:
      - epel-release: https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
{% if grains['os'] == 'CentOS' %} 
      - ius-release: https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
{% elif grains['os'] == 'RedHat' %}
      - ius-release: https://rhel7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
{% endif %}
{% endif %} 
```
Running the same .rpms listed above manually via `yum install` works fine--no errors.

Same state works correctly when running against 2016.3.x  and 2016.11.x
