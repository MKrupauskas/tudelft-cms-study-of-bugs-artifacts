When running:

```
sudo salt-call dockerng.push master:5000/petar/export_beam_integrals.server:latest insecure_registry=True
```

I get the following error:

```
APIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error ("invalid registry endpoint https://master:5000/v2/: Get https://master:5000/v2/: tls: oversized record received with length 20527. If this private registry supports only HTTP or HTTPS with an unknown CA certificate, please add `--insecure-registry master:5000` to the daemon's arguments. In the case of HTTPS, if you have access to the registry's CA certificate, no need for the flag; simply place the CA certificate at /etc/docker/certs.d/master:5000/ca.crt")

```

due to not passing the `insecure_registry` parameter to the `__context__['docker.client'].login` call in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2015.8.1/salt/modules/dockerng.py#L868

Easy fix would be to just pass the `insecure_registry` parameter, but please note that the docker-py's `login()` is depreciating the `insecure_registry` parameter:
- https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/1.5.0/docker/api/daemon.py#L35
- https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/1.5.0/docker/constants.py#L8

A better solution would be not to perform `__context__['docker.client'].login` calls in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2015.8.1/salt/modules/dockerng.py#L868 if `insecure_registry` is `True`.

I got to this issue while trying to find a new workaround to #28004, so I'll mark it as related.
