**Description**
Salt is not picking up my custom installed ca certificates and any http query to any hosts with issued certificates of that ca are unable to be verified.

```
$ sudo salt "myhost" http.query "https://vault:8200/v1/sys/seal-status"
Error running 'http.query': HTTPSConnectionPool(host='vault', port=8200): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/sys/seal-status (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1056)')))
```

The same does work for example with curl from the same host
```
$ curl  -X GET 'https://vault:8200/v1/sys/seal-status'
{"type":"shamir","initialized":true,"sealed":false,...}
```

**Setup**
I have a self signed pki with the ca certificates installed on the host in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ and ran the command for linking to the local ca store with

```
$ sudo update-ca-certificates --verbose --fresh
Clearing symlinks in /etc/ssl/certs...
done.
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
Doing .
...
link intranet0.pem -> 0c84b26d.0
link intranet1.pem -> 0c84b26d.1
...

```



**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Install self signed ca certificates. Do a http request with salt to an endpoint which has an issued certificate of that ca.

**Expected behavior**
Salt is able to pick up the ca certificates which have been linked to /etc/ssl/certs by the operating system to verify any issued certificates.

**Additional context**
 It worked with v2019. I guess it stopped working since some dependencies got bundled with salt?

Which certificate store is saltstack using?
