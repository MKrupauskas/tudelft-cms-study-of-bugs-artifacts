I remember something similar has already been discussed in #15846, but the fix only works if at least one other method of detection succeeds. However, in LXC containers that are only able to work with virt-what, the result is "physical".

I believe it is sufficient to add 'lxc' into the tuple in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/grains/core.py#L569 (of course I can create a PR if necessary). Thanks!
