### Description of Issue/Question

`file.accumulated` doesn't work unless you specifically use the old-style, explicit, state module name within its `require_in` / `watch_in` arg. Using just the state name per https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/requisites.html#omitting-state-module-in-requisites results in:
```
Comment: Orphaned accumulator handler-accumulator in <state>
