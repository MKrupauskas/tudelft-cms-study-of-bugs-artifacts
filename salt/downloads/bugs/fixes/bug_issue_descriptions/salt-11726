When restarting the `salt-minion` service on Windows clients, the `salt-minion` service will be stopped but won't be started again.

```
salt test-minion-0001 service.restart salt-minion
```

Will leave the minion in a dead/unresponsive state, as the service has been shut down.
Even replacing the stop first, then start again approach by an atomic `Restart-Service` PowerShell cmdlet doesn't keep salt-minion from pulling the rug under his own feet.

A possible approach could be to spawn a subprocess which takes care of restarting the service in case salt-minion itself should be restarted.
