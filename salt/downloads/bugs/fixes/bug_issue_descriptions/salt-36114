### Description of Issue/Question

I am using a custom returner so that I can generate events that get sent to the master when a job is run from the salt scheduler.  The reactor on the master triggers a runner that sends alerts when scheduled jobs fail.  Jobs, such as highstate, where the "return" data provided to the returner is a dict always report "success" as True even though individual states return values in the "return" dict fail.
### Setup

Schedule pillar shared by all minions:

```
schedule:
  highstate-before-midnight-pst:
    name: highstate
    function: state.apply
    run_on_start: False
    kwargs:
      test: False
    seconds: 1800 {#- 30 minutes #}
    splay: 1200
    range:
      start: 9:00pm
      end: 11:59pm
    returner: schedule-returner
    maxrunning: 3
```

On one minion there is a persistent failure regarding one ssh key that shows up in the "return" dict:

```
{
    ...
    "ssh_known_hosts_|-add-known-host-foo_|-present": {
        "__run_num__": 164,
        "changes": {},
        "comment": "Remote host public key found but its fingerprint does not match one you have provided",
        "duration": 215.297,
        "name": "<REDACTED>",
        "result": false,
        "start_time": "15:31:09.962431"
    },
    ...
```

yet the "success" value reported to the returner is True.
