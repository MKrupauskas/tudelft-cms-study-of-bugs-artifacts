### Description of Issue/Question

`top_file_merging_strategy` seems to not work at all.

With provided setup, I switch from `merge` to `same` without any changes. I was expecting `merge` would force to keep `base` > `sys` order when executing states.

Moreover, with the provided setup, if you replace all "`sys`" by `prod`, order become the good one.

So, it's seems this could be one or two differents bugs:

1. `top_file_merging_strategy` doesn not change anything.
2. the environment name is the one thing that determines execution order.


### Setup

_This is the minimal setup I found to reproduce the bug_


`/etc/salt/master`:

```
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/saltstates/salt/base
  prod:
    - /srv/saltstates/salt/prod
  sys:
    - /srv/saltstates/salt/sys

top_file_merging_strategy: merge
env_order:
    - base
    - sys
```

-----

`/srv/saltstates/salt/sys/top.sls`:

```
sys:
  'sys.*':
    - install
```


`/srv/saltstates/salt/sys/install.sls`:

```
include:
  - should_be_second
```


`/srv/saltstates/salt/sys/should_be_second.sls`:

```
/tmp/SYS-should_be_second:
    file.managed:
        - contents:
            - 'foo'
```

------

`/srv/saltstates/salt/base/top.sls`:

```
base:
  '*':
    - install
```

`/srv/saltstates/salt/base/install.sls`:

```
include:
  - should_be_first
```

`/srv/saltstates/salt/base/should_be_first.sls`:
```
/tmp/BASE-should_be_first:
    file.managed:
        - contents:
            - 'foo'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt sys.locsbc1 state.highstate`

```
sys.locsbc1:
----------
          ID: /tmp/SYS-should_be_second
    Function: file.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: File /tmp/SYS-should_be_second is in the correct state
     Started: 15:47:07.480829
    Duration: 13.062 ms
     Changes:   
----------
          ID: /tmp/BASE-should_be_first
    Function: file.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: File /tmp/BASE-should_be_first is in the correct state
     Started: 15:47:07.494050
    Duration: 0.872 ms
     Changes:   

Summary for sys.locsbc1
------------
Succeeded: 2
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     2
Total run time:  13.934 ms
```

I was expecting to see `BASE-should_be_first` executed before `SYS-should_be_second`.

Again, using `prod` instead of `sys` within the setup (files, state names, minionid, etc ..) it execute states in the right order (but I'm not sure this is not a coincidence).
