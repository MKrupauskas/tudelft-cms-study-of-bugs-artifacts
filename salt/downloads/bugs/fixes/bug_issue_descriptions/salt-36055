### Description of Issue/Question

Creating a cloud instance on 2015.8.10 generates these tags on the event bus:

```
# salt-run state.event | while read -r t d; do echo $t | grep 'thing'; done
salt/cloud/thing/creating
salt/cloud/thing/requesting
salt/cloud/thing/querying
salt/cloud/thing/tagging
salt/cloud/thing/waiting_for_ssh
salt/cloud/thing/deploying
salt/cloud/thing/destroying
salt/cloud/thing/destroyed
orc/decommission/thing/complete
```

in response to...

```
salt-cloud -p known-working-profile thing
```

followed by

```
salt-cloud -dy thing
```

**note**: the instances are successfully created; however, when the instances are deleted, no cleanup is done (minion_id__DELFdfsjksdjhl keys get abandoned on the filesystem)

Since I am setting up in a new environment, I thought I'd give `transport: tcp` a spin.  I did end up switching back to `transport: zmq` for the time being, but switching seemed to have no bearing on the problem.   If I can't get this figured out in the next few business days I'll probably end up moving back to 2015.8.x.

**side note**:  the `tcp` transport piece is sweet.  I didn't run into anything that didn't work that seemed connected to the transport--it seems to perform excellently!  Bravo!    
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Launch and/or destroy public cloud instances with salt-cloud using 2016.3.3

This is provider agnostic--Both providers emit nothing.

The salt-master debug logs show no events of the `salt/cloud` prefix.
