### Description of Issue/Question
If cmd_subset function is called with the 'full_return' paramenter, it will not match any minions. If called without that parameter it works as expected.

This is caused by the said parameter missing from the function declaration in salt/client/__init__.py after line 441 (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/client/__init__.py#L441). Because it is missing, it is passed as generic **kwargs to self.cmd function call on line 466, which modifies the output and prevents the whole thing from working.

This is very simple to fix by adding the said parameter in the declaration and in the return function after line 481.

### Setup

```
import salt.client
salt = salt.client.LocalClient(c_path='/etc/salt/master')
results = salt.cmd_subset('*', 'cmd.run', ['hostname'], sub=1, full_return=True)
print(results)
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Run the above code and notice that no minions will be matched. Run the same code without the 'full_return=True' , and notice it will work as expected.
