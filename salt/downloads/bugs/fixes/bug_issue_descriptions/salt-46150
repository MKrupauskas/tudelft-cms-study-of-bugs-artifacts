### Description of Issue/Question

Looking into this issue it looks like some packages have different capitalization when checking the remote version. so when used with `check_remote=True` the package is not matching any of the contents of the available dict. Which results in the following error. 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\salt\bin\Scripts\salt-call", line 11, in <module>
    salt_call()
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\scripts.py", line 391, in salt_call
    client.run()
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\cli\call.py", line 58, in run
    caller.run()
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\cli\caller.py", line 134, in run
    ret = self.call()
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\cli\caller.py", line 204, in call
    ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\chocolatey.py", line 889, in version
    'available': available[pkg]}
KeyError: 'freesshd'
```
I have only tested with `freesshd` which to the remote system shows up as `freeSSHD`. 

This issue also stops `salt.state.chocolatey.installed` from testing already installed programs that this issue affects.  

### Setup
Install chocolatey on a windows machine. install freesshd then check it's version with `salt-call chocolatey.version freesshd check_remote=True` 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
install freesshd then check it's version with `salt-call chocolatey.version freesshd check_remote=True`
