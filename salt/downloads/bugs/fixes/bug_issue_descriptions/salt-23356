Any time I run any orchestration using any number of runners, I get the following traceback after all of the runners are finished:

```
Exception occurred in runner state.orch: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 335, in low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/runners/state.py", line 117, in orchestrate
    __jid_event__.fire_event({'data': ret, 'outputter': 'highstate'}, 'progress')
ReferenceError: weakly-referenced object no longer exists
```

This is on develop:

```

To duplicate, create a runner at mytest.py:

```
def ping():
    return True
```

Create a runnertest.sls:

```
mytest.ping:
  salt.runner
```

Run it with the orchestrator:

```
# salt-run state.orch runnertest
True
