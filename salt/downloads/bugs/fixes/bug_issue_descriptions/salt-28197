Hi, I'm using the windows installer in silent mode.
When I use a numeric value with leading 0's such as 0777 as the minion name,
it does not get quoted in minion conf file.
For example if i use the command.

Salt-Minion-0.17.0-Setup-amd64.exe /S /master=yoursaltmaster /minion-name=0777,

I'll end up with
id: 0777
in the minion file. 0777 is treated as an octal by yaml so i'll end up with an id of '511' when all is said and done. It seems to me that any minion name you use in the command line should be quoted if necessary in the conf file.

I would like to see 
id: '0777'
in the conf file.
