### Description of Issue/Question

With more than two masters multi-master failover setup, salt-minion fails to connect to the third one after first and second masters are down. After the second master in the list is down, salt-minion ends up with connecting back to salt-master1, which is down, and then to salt-master2, which is down as well, back to salt-master1 again. This becomes a dead loop. 
### Setup

```
master:
  - master1
  - master2
  - master3
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
master_failback: True
master_failback_interval: 30 
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

masters:
`[master1, master2, master3]`
master1 is the master minion is currently connecting.
1. shutdown salt-master service on master1
2. minion connect to master2 based on order,  the local master list changes to <br>
   `[master2, master3, master1]`
3. shutdown salt-master service on master2, the local master list changes to  <br>
   `[master1, master3, master2]`
4. minion connect to master1 and end up with dead loop. 

The master list generated in step 3 is definitely wrong. It should be
`[master3, master1, master2]`
