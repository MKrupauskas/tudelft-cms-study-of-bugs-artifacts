### Description of Issue/Question
Hello.
salt.states.file.managed have option - keep_source. It description say:
Set to False to **discard the cached copy of the source file** once the state completes. This can be useful for larger files to keep them from taking up space **in minion cache**.  ...

Problem is that after managed command state execution. Cached file is still in minion cache. 
### Setup
my .sls file (./states/copy.sls):
```
 DIST:
      file.managed:
        - name: /xxxx/dpldev/packages/rel_xxxx_xxxx.tar.gz
        - source: salt://packages//rel_xxxx_xxxx.tar.gz
        - user: 16379
        - group: 200
        - mode: 744
        - keep_source: False
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
sudo salt  '*myserver*' state.apply states.copy
