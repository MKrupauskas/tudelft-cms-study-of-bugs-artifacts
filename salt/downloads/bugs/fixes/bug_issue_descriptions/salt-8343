On git develop `file.accumulated` now throws an exception when using the `require_in` clause. I should be receiving an "Orphaned accumulated" exception message ([here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/78662d270b53150573e431a2c019068d22ff0874/salt/states/file.py#L2753)). Possibly related to commit cecd105, although I haven't bisected it.

```
test:
  file:
    - accumulated
    - name: sections
    - filename: /etc/test
    - require_in:
      - file: some-config-file
    - text: "myconfig value"


State: - file
    Name:      sections
    Function:  accumulated
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
