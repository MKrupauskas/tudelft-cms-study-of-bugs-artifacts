### Description of Issue/Question

Since updating to 2016.3.1 (from 2015.8.8), I've started seeing _a lot_ of this in the master log on my development setup (2 Centos vagrant boxes):

> 2016-07-27 16:30:01,034 [salt.transport.ipc][ERROR   ][2378] Exception occurred while handling stream: [Errno 0] Success

It seems related to `publish.runner`, I can reproduce with `salt-call publish.runner manage.up`. Everything apparently works, but when there is a lot of publishing going on it leads to quite a high volume of log garbage.
