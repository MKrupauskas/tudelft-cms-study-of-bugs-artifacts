### Description of Issue/Question

`comments` in `pkgrepo.managed` does not behave as documented. The documentation states, "Anything supplied for this list will be saved in the repo configuration with a comment marker (#) in front." However, Salt does not behave this way; anything in the comments section is added WITHOUT a # in front. I am not sure if the behavior or the documentation is wrong, but they don't match.
### Setup
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

This state:

```
epel:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
    - mirrorlist: https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-7&arch=$basearch
    - comments:
        - 'baseurl=http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/$basearch'
    - gpgcheck: 1
    - gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7
    - priority: 3
```

Produces this repo file:

```
[epel]
priority=3
mirrorlist=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-7&arch=$basearch
name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7
enabled=1
baseurl=http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/$basearch
```

Note that no # sign is placed in front of `baseurl`, so it is not actually a comment. You have to include the # sign in your state.
