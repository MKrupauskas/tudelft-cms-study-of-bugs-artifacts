We are mounting some NFS shares to multiple mount mounts, for example

```
mount server:/share /etc/foo
mount server:/share /etc/bar
```

Salt will happy mount these but will only add one of them to fstab, I think the first one. The host will be missing the /etc/bar mount if it is rebooted because it's not in fstab. I think salt goes through the first column in /etc/fstab and matches it against what needs to be added to fstab, and that is why it only adds one.
