This isn't really a problem with how the repo is laid out or how other packaging systems may or may not work. But, these symlinks

<pre>
jtang@awesome-o:[(none)@develop]salt$ find . -type l
./pkg/arch/salt-master.service
./pkg/arch/salt-minion.service
./pkg/arch/salt-syndic.service

</pre>


The above symlinks break the hashdist packaging system -- https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist, hashdist treats symlinks inside tarballs as being risks to being able to repeatably and reliably building packages.

I just want to point out that these symlinks may cause packaging systems problems if they have stricter handling of symlinks inside the tarball/git repo.
