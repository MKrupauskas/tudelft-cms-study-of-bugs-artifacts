Having created my users with the user.present state and associated pillar data

```
user.present:
    - name: {{ args['name'] }}
    - fullname: {{ namestring }}
    - uid: {{ args['uid'] }}
    - gid: {{ args['primary_group'] }}
    - shell: {{ args['shell'] }}
    - home: {{ args['home'] }}
    - mindays: {{ pillar['defaults']['users']['mindays'] }}
    - maxdays: {{ args['maxdays'] }}
```

I had mindays set to 1 in pillar data.

Upon changing the pillar mindays setting to be 0 - we changed our policy at work to allow a different password policy - and then running highstate or apply for the users nothing was changed.

Looking at the source for  salt/salt/states/user.py

it says:

```
      if mindays and mindays is not 0 and lshad['min'] != mindays:
        change['mindays'] = mindays
```

but the issue is I **AM** setting it to **0** from another value
so I am not sure if the code wants to read:

```
      if mindays and mindays is not 0 OR lshad['min'] != mindays:
        change['mindays'] = mindays
```

and the same logic for the other items:

```
         date=0,
         mindays=0,
         maxdays=999999,
         inactdays=0,
         warndays=7,
         expire=-1,
```
