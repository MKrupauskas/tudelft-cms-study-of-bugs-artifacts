Package versions: 

salt-2014.1.0-1.el6.noarch
salt-master-2014.1.0-1.el6.noarch
salt-minion-2014.1.0-1.el6.noarch

Running: `salt -C 'G@environment:LIVE' pkg.version opsview-agent`
returns the package version for our agent install on all our boxes but randomly some (20%ish) don't return the result to the command output. If you look in the logs, they have run the command, if you check the command it shows the version, it simply doesn't display anything to the user.

Suspect this issue affects more than just pkg.version too, might be the whole module.
