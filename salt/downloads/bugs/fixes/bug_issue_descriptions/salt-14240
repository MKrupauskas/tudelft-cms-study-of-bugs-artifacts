I'm experiencing major problems with my pillar data and gitfs after upgrading from 2014.1.3 to 2014.1.7 (I did not try the intermediate versions since most of them have various severe regressions of their own). Downgrading to 2014.1.3 and blowing away /var/cache/salt/master/ restores pillar functionality. I've tried removing all traces of Salt from the system and doing a clean install of 2014.1.7, same result.

After the upgrade, none of my pillar data is sent to minions. It is not present in pillar.items output and highstates fail due to missing data. I see a string of messages like this in /var/log/salt/master:

```
2014-07-15 10:14:52,852 [root                                        ][ERROR   ] Unable to checkout branch master: 'git checkout origin/master' returned exit status 128: fatal: Unable to create '/var/cache/salt/master/pillar_gitfs/0/.git/index.lock': File exists.

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.
```

The lockfile does not seem to actually exist, however. Even after entirely deleting /var/cache/salt/master/ and restarting salt-master, the error immediately returns. It also fails to actually check out the pillar data into /var/cache/salt/master/pillar_gitfs/. I just get a /0/ dir with nop.sls in it. Nothing else.
