Hi, I'm finding the epel5 rpms as I have lots of centos 5 servers, and it seems that https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/saltstack/salt-el5/ repos shows me the 2015.5.0 rpms, which is different to http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/saltstack/salt/ repo(there is 2014.7.5).

In order to make a same minions version, could you pls offer me the 2014.7.5 epel5 rpm? I still cannot find it on the internet.

Many Thanks.
