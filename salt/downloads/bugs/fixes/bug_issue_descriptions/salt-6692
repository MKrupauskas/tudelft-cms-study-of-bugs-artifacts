If a `supervisord.running` service has `updated: True`, it will not be restarted if one of its dependencies has changed (e.g. a configuration file for the service, but _not_ the supervisor conf file for the process).

Example:

``` yaml
/etc/service.conf:
    file.managed:
        - source: salt://service.conf

/etc/supervisor/conf.d/service.conf:
    file.managed:
        - source: salt://service.supervisor.conf

service:
    supervisord.running:
        - update: True
        - watch:
            - file: /etc/service.conf
            - file: /etc/supervisor/conf.d/service.conf
```

If `/etc/service.conf` is updated during a `state.highstate`, you get this output:

```
    State: - supervisord
    Name:      service
    Function:  running
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Not starting already running service: stashy
        Changes:   stashy: Updating supervisor
```
