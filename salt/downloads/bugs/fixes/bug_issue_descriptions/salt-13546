If I start a minion in multi-master mode too soon after the master has started, I get a traceback in the minion log:

```
2014-06-18 21:23:15,129 [salt.log.setup                           ][ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: 'minion'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/salt-minion", line 14, in <module>
    salt_minion()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 66, in salt_minion
    ret = minion.start()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/__init__.py", line 255, in start
    self.minion.tune_in()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 509, in tune_in
    minion = minion['minion']
KeyError: 'minion'
```

This is on near-current develop, hash 6890d04947d485753a220dfabd4d74ce77e2b658

My minion config:

```
master:
  - localhost
```

Master config is empty.

If I start the master, wait a few seconds, and then start the minion, it works fine.  If I start them at nearly the same time (in a script, in this case), I get the traceback above.  If I then attempt to start the minion again, it works.

@felskrone Tom thinks this may have something to do with recent changes you have made in this area.  Could you see if you can reproduce this, and maybe look into it?
