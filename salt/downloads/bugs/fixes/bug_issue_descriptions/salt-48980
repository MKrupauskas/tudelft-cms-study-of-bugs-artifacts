### Description of Issue/Question

When using `env` as a variable in a pillar include, it gets removed without logging.

### Setup

```
foo.sls

include:
  - bar:
    defaults:
      env: "something"

bar.sls

bar: {{ env }}
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

use above files for a host and try `pillar.items`. `bar` will not be as expected.

The reason should be in `salt/template.py:61`:

```
    if 'env' in kwargs:
        # "env" is not supported; Use "saltenv".
        kwargs.pop('env')
```

It should at least be logged to the master log.
