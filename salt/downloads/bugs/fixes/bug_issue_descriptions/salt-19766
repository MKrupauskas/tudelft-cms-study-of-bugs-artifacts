While troubleshooting an issue I installed the 2014.7.0-1 (32bit) minion on Windows Server 2008R2 (64bit).  At the end of the install there is a checkbox to start salt-minion.  Unchecking the box has no effect.  The service is started if the box is checked and if the box is unchecked.

I tested on 3 different Win 2008R2 servers.  All 3 servers previously had 64bit version of salt-minion  installed but not working.  The uninstall of the 64 bit version was succeful (i.e. c:\salt was gone as well as the salt-minion service).
