Some state caused salt to reload its modules, which caused an event to be fired. When using --local this adds quite a bit of wasted time to the execution.

```
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[DEBUG   ] SaltEvent PUB socket URI: ipc:///var/run/salt/minion/minion_event_fdf9f40084_pub.ipc
[DEBUG   ] SaltEvent PULL socket URI: ipc:///var/run/salt/minion/minion_event_fdf9f40084_pull.ipc
[DEBUG   ] Sending event - data = {'_stamp': '2014-06-12T20:49:59.986258'}
```
