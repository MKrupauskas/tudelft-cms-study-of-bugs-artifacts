The `cmd` prefix for sending commands to minions in the reactor doesn't match the same thing in `salt-api` (which goes by `local`). There's a related problem in the Orchestrate runner with the generic `function` and `state` function names. It would be nice to have a consistent way to refer to these.

Perhaps add an alias to the reactor for `local` -> `cmd`?
