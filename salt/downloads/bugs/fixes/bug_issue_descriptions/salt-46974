Salt 2018.3.0 appears to need a newer version of libnacl than what's provided in the saltstack repo.

### Broken setup:

Summary     : Python bindings for libsodium/tweetnacl based on ctypes

License     : ASL 2.0
Description : This library is used to gain direct access to the functions exposed by Daniel
            : J. Bernstein's nacl library via libsodium or tweetnacl. It has been constructed
            : to maintain extensive documentation on how to use nacl as well as being
            : completely portable. The file in libnacl/__init__.py can be pulled out and
            : placed directly in any project to give a single file binding to all of nacl.
            :
            : This is the Python 2 build of the module.
```
Running anything related to libnacl returns "'nacl' __virtual__ returned False: libnacl import error, perhaps missing python libnacl package or should update." Example below:
```
# salt-call --local nacl.keygen
'nacl' __virtual__ returned False: libnacl import error, perhaps missing python libnacl package or should update.
```
### Apparent Fix
Uninstalling the python-libnacl package, installing pip (via the python2-pip package), and then upgrading libnacl fixes the issue (BTW, yum erase python-libnacl doesn't appear to clean up everything):
 ```
# pip install libnacl
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): libnacl in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.3 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

# pip install libnacl --upgrade
Collecting libnacl
  Downloading libnacl-1.6.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: libnacl
  Found existing installation: libnacl 1.4.3
    DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (libnacl) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.
    Uninstalling libnacl-1.4.3:
      Successfully uninstalled libnacl-1.4.3
Successfully installed libnacl-1.6.1
You are using pip version 8.1.2, however version 9.0.3 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

It would appear that the version provided in the saltstack repo for 2018.3.x needs to be updated.

Please let me know if you need any addition info.
