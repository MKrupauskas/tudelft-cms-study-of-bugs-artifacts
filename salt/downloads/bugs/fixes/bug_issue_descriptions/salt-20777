I use epel6 packages. Over the weekend, the packages were upgraded in the epel6 repo. I have a pkg.latest that installs the salt-master and salt-minions on my fleet.

When the master upgraded, the init script failed to stop the 2014.7.0 master. As a result that 2014.7.0 master was left running after the package was installed (and also after a cronjob that did "service salt-master restart" had run and after a manual attempt to "service salt-master restart").

Simultaneously, some minions were upgraded to 2014.7.0. I don't know if the package restarted them, but they were successfully restarted by a cron job. When the 2014.7.1 minions were attempting to run scheduled highstates, I would see the following in the logs:

```

```

Once I manually killed the old masters (SIGKILL to the pids this time) and restarted the master, the minions started to work. I am sorry, but I don't have any more info.
