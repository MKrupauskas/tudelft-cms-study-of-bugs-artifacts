MemoryError
```

The file in question was a 162MB zip file. I restarted some services on the minion host to free up some memory and it was working again, but certainly there must be better ways of downloading a file than loading it all into memory.

If there isn't a better default behaviour to use than this tornado simple HTTP client, I suggest adding an arg that lets you specify how http sources are managed. For example:

```
/tmp/file:
  file.managed
  - source: http://wherever
  - http_method: wget
```

For this particular case, I'm simply changing my file.managed state into a cmd.run.
