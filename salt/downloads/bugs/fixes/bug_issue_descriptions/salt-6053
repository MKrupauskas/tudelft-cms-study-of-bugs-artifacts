`supervisord.running` returns invalid response when running with `test=True`

Here's an example response:

```

----------
    State: - supervisord
    Name:      celery
    Function:  running
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1204, in call
    self.verify_ret(ret)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 580, in verify_ret
    'Malformed state return, return must be a dict'
SaltException: Malformed state return, return must be a dict

        Changes:

```

Looks like the [return value is missing](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/supervisord.py#L78)
