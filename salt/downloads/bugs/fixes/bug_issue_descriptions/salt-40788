### Description of Issue/Question
I created the setup as described in [the docs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/topology/syndic.html#configuring-the-syndic-with-multimaster) - 3 syndics connected to a master-master pair.
Each master returns different results for the same command, issued at different times. Results differ between masters too. 

### Setup
2 top-masters (top-master-01 and top-master-02)
3 syndics + master + minion
10 minions connected to syndics in failover mode, as directed in the docs.

#### Master config (top-master-01): `/etc/salt/master.d/master.conf`
```
master_id: top-master-01

master_sign_pubkey: True
master_use_pubkey_signature: True

# Needed for masters which have syndics attached
order_masters: True
```

#### Syndic config
3 machines having the same configuration, as follows:
`/etc/salt/master.d/master.conf`
```
master_sign_pubkey: True
master_use_pubkey_signature: True
```
`/etc/salt/master.d/syndic.conf`
```
syndic_master:
  - top-master-01
  - top-master-02
syndic_failover: random
```
`/etc/salt/minion.d/minion.conf`
```
master:
  - top-master-01
  - top-master-02
verify_master_pubkey_sign: True
```

#### Minion config
10 machines having the same configuration, as follows:
`etc/salt/minion.d/minion.conf`
```
master:
  - syndic-master-01
  - syndic-master-02
  - syndic-master-03

master_type: failover
master_shuffle: True
master_alive_interval: 5
verify_master_pubkey_sign: True
```

All signing pub keys were exchanged, and all minions were accepted on all syndic masters, so no issues there, they can happily communicate

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Include the setup above.

When I issue `time salt-run manage.up` I get totally random results, please see below:

```
[root@top-master-01 ~]# time salt-run manage.up
- salt-syndic-minion-03
- salt-syndic-minion-02
- salt-syndic-minion-01

real    0m21.325s
user    0m1.194s
sys     0m0.205s
[root@top-master-01 ~]# time salt-run manage.up
- salt-syndic-minion-03
- salt-syndic-minion-02
- salt-syndic-minion-01
- salt-minion-09
- salt-minion-06
- salt-minion-07
- salt-minion-04
- salt-minion-02
- salt-minion-03
- salt-minion-01

real    0m21.212s
user    0m1.070s
sys     0m0.185s
```
```
[root@top-master-02 ~]# time salt-run manage.up
- salt-syndic-minion-03
- salt-syndic-minion-02
- salt-syndic-minion-01
- salt-minion-09
- salt-minion-06
- salt-minion-02
- salt-minion-01

real    0m21.498s
user    0m1.285s
sys     0m0.244s
[root@top-master-02 ~]# time salt-run manage.up
- salt-syndic-minion-03
- salt-syndic-minion-02
- salt-syndic-minion-01

real    0m21.371s
user    0m1.183s
sys     0m0.238s
```

**Please note**: If I use a single top-master, the problems disappear and it returns consistent results as follows:
- If all minions are alive, in about 6 seconds;
- If even one minion is stopped/dead/etc. it takes 21 seconds.

Please let me know if you need more information.
