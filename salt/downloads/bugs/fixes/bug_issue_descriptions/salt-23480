Custom runner modules do not pick up custom execution modules. Although both modules are available in the corresponding `extension_modules` directories the custom execution module is not available in the `__salt__` dictionary that is injected into the custom runner module.

Thanks to Carolyn Van Slyck on salt-users for the report.
