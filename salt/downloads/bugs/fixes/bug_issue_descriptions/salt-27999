In 2015.5.3 we had a regression in the state compiler, which took a while to realize how wide spread it was, where a state run that required an external dependency that hadn't been installed yet stacktraced instead of reporting the missing dependency. We need some tests written in our test suite to catch this so that this doesn't happen again.

Some of the issues that I found that exhibited this same stack trace and behavior are:
#26115
#26280
#26454
#26493
#26510
#26882
#27016
#26703
#27321
#27619
