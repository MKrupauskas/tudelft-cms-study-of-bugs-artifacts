**Description**
When attempting to configure a vault connection and sdb setup, salt is simply unable to get appropriate values from vault in any capacity, complaining about the sdb vault script and a "uses" KeyError.

**Setup**
Salt Version 3001
Vault 1.4.2 running locally in dev mode

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Follow this guide to bootstrap salt w/ vault sdb:
https://help.saltstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041140451-Quick-Guide-to-Vault-Integration

### Error Message
```
/etc/salt# salt-run sdb.get 'sdb://localvault/salt/data/test/foo'
[ERROR   ] Failed to read secret! KeyError: 'uses'
Exception occurred in runner sdb.get: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/sdb/vault.py", line 97, in get
    response = __utils__["vault.make_request"]("GET", url, profile)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/vault.py", line 326, in make_request
    **args
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/vault.py", line 342, in make_request
    connection["uses"] -= 1
KeyError: 'uses'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 397, in low
    data["return"] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/runners/sdb.py", line 26, in get
    return salt.utils.sdb.sdb_get(uri, __opts__, __utils__)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/sdb.py", line 46, in sdb_get
    return loaded_db[fun](query, profile=profile)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/sdb/vault.py", line 113, in get
    raise salt.exceptions.CommandExecutionError(e)
salt.exceptions.CommandExecutionError: 'uses
```
### Master Config:
```
vault:
  url: http://127.0.0.1:8200
  auth:
    method: token
    token: ROOT_TOKEN
  policies:
    - saltmaster

localvault:
  driver: vault
```
### Vault Evidence
```
# vault kv get salt/test
====== Metadata ======
Key              Value

=== Data ===
Key    Value

```

**Expected behavior**
Salt with a vault sdb is able to successfully pull a secret from vault (either kv1 or kv2)

**Additional context**
Upgraded to 3001 today after it was released due to the desire to connect to a v2 kv store on vault. Even attempting vault kv1 with a root token produces the same problem and a complete inability to get secrets out.

Would not be surprised if it was my configuration, but I'd assume the quickstart guide would still be relevant.
