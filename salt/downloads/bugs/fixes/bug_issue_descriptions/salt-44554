### Description of Issue/Question

SPM install does not place the custom modules and states in the correct location (`/srv/spm/salt/_modules` and `/srv/spm/salt/_states`, respectively). It instead places them inside the formula directory. This is not the [documented behavior](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/spm/spm_formula.html#loader-modules), and it is a regression since 2016.11.

I suspect this may be related to #42646, but I didn't notice until now because we haven't deployed a new salt master or changed my custom states between the release of 2017.1.0 and now. I've confirmed that my upgraded salt master now contains copies in both the correct and incorrect locations, but the files in the correct location have not been touched since we upgraded to 2017.1 in July.

### Setup

Assume the existence of a SPM package repository containing a package `foo-formula` which contains a custom state (i.e. `foo-formula/_states/foo.py`)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
spm install foo
ls /srv/spm/salt  # Note absence of _states
ls /srv/spm/salt/foo  # Note presence of _states
```
