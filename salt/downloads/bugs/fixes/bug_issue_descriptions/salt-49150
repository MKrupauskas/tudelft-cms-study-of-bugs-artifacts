Dear all:
  I am using Saltstack to modify /etc/hosts file.
  Sometimes I just found salt-minion modified my /etc/hosts with odd characters.
  Here is some minion log(I obscured some IP&username info):

And sometimes the same command can run correctly on the same machine:

So does anybody give me some tips about this?
Thanks a lot!
