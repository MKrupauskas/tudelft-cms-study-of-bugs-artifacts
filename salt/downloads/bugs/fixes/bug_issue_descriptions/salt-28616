I mistakenly forgot to remove `bin_env` from my `pip.installed` arguments. The venv is no longer created, thus the pip binary cannot be found:

``` salt
{% for pkg in pillar['pip-packages'] %}
Install pip package {{pkg}}:
  pip.installed:
    - name: {{pkg}}
    - bin_env: /tmp/test_venv
    - require:
      - pkg: python-pip
{% endfor %}
```

However, the result of running this is a success:

```
    docker-image: ID: Install pip package path.py >= 8.1.2
    docker-image: Function: pip.installed
    docker-image: Name: path.py >= 8.1.2
