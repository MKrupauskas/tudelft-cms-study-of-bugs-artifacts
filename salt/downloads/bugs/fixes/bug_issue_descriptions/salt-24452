Chocolatey does not upgrade the package jre8 if you run it with salt:

```
# salt SEGRETERIA2014 pkg.list_pkgs

SEGRETERIA2014:
    ----------
    Java 8 Update 31 (64-bit):
        8.0.310

# salt SEGRETERIA2014 chocolatey.install jre8 force=true

```

(I cut some text from the first command)

after this if I run again:

```
# salt SEGRETERIA2014 pkg.list_pkgs

I have the same problem if I run chocolatey with salt and powershell:

```
# salt SEGRETERIA2014 cmd.run 'choco install -y --force jre8  ' shell=powershell

by the way chocolatey think to have java the lastest java version installed (I used the --force switch because of this):

```
# salt SEGRETERIA2014 cmd.run 'choco upgrade -y jre8  ' shell=powershell

The same problem occour with the last 2 versions of salt (2015.5.0 and 2014.7.5... I didn't try with earlier version) on windows 7/8/8.1 (I have abount 100 windows pc with salt+chocolatey), I don't know if it is a problem of salt (some kind of permission? but other packages like vlc upgrade without problem) or of chocolatey (but if I run the command on the pc it work!).
