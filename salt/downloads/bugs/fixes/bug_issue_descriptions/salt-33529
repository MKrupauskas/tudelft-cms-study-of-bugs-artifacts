### Description

I am running `salt-ssh` on Mac OS X 10.11.5 against a FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE-p3 host. `pkg.latest` appears to be completely broken on FreeBSD in the Salt 2016.3 release. For example, applying the following state:

```
curl: # ftp/curl
  pkg.latest: []
```

results in this stack trace:

```
----------
          ID: curl
    Function: pkg.latest
      Result: False

Other `pkg.latest` states fail in a similar fashion. Using package origins (rather than names) does not make any difference. (`pkg.installed` appears to work, however.)

The states were working perfectly with Salt 2015.8.10. The only change is upgrading to Salt 2016.3.
