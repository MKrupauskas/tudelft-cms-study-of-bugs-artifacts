### Description of Issue/Question
dockerng.network_present with specified containers is not idempotent for docker engine >= v1.28.
A second call results in a failure to connect the already connected container:

          ID: test
    Function: dockerng.network_present
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to connect container '...' to network 'mynetwork' Error 500: {"message":"endpoint with name mycontainer already exists in network mynetwork"}
     Started: 05:11:45.107676
    Duration: 432.294 ms
     Changes:
	 
This seems to be caused by docker-py's following call to the docker-API, which does not return nested container information:

 ```
[DEBUG   ] Attempting to run docker-py's "networks" function with args=() and kwargs={'names': ['mynetwork'], 'ids': None}
[DEBUG   ] "GET /v1.29/networks?filters=%7B%22name%22%3A+%5B%22mynetwork%22%5D%7D HTTP/1.1" 200 382

```
A request that would return the network's containers is:
`/v1.29/networks?filters=%7B%22name%22%3A+%5B%7B%22mynetwork%22%3Atrue%7D%5D%7D
`
or
`/v1.29/networks/mynetwork?verbose=true`

So instead of {"name": ["mynetwork"]} the filter should read {"name": [{"mynetwork":true}]} to enable verbose output, which was introduced with v1.28.

### Setup

```
#./mynetwork.sls:
mynetwork:
    dockerng.network_present:
        - containers:
            - mycontainer
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Execute twice:
`salt '<host-name>' state.apply
`
