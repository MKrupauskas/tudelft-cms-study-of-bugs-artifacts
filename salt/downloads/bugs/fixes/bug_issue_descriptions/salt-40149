### Description of Issue/Question

Why is it an error if you're on a pure systemd system with no /etc/init.d??

### Setup
2016.11.3, but that's hardly relevant. Look at [jettero@2d254be0f6] for details.

### Other
I didn't submit a pull request (or indeed, finish the thought) because I'm just asking. I get this error constantly, and I refuse to give in and pretend I have an /etc/init.d â€¦ I don't have or want one. Could we maybe have a config option about whether this should be an error? should it not be an error?
