After installing rabbitmq-server, use of rabbitmq.add_vhost or other module functions fails with "Module function rabbitmq.add_vhost is not available" error.

``` yaml
rabbitmq-server:
  pkg.installed: []

# use rabbitmq module
rabbitmq_add_vhost:
  module.run:
    - name: rabbitmq.add_vhost
    - vhost: '/sensu'

# use rabbitmq_vhost state
rabbitmq_vhost.present:
  - vhost: '/sensu'
```

Both module and state functions fail unless salt-minion is restated after installing rtabbitmq-server.

This can be verified by running "salt-call sys.list_functions | grep rebbitmq" which comes up empty. Once salt-minion is restarted, you can use all the rabbitmq functions.

I believe this bug might be introduced by this commit by @s0undt3ch if I am not mistaken: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/7d114ac4ecb397d641ad4e68975a5f44303d1192

Since rabbitmq-server is not installed on the salt-minion initially, salt.utils.which('rabbitmqctl') will obviously return None thus rabbitmq.py:**virtual**() returning False and preventing rabbitmq.py module from being loaded. A minion restart after installing rabbitmq-server will obviously fix this problem.

What is the harm in loading rabbitmq module when Rabbitmq is not installed?
