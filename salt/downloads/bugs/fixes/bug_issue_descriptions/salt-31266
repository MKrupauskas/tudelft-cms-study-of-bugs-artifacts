When running Salt in a Docker container, I get:

```
salt | [WARNING ] Although 'dmidecode' was found in path, the current user cannot execute it. Grains output might not be accurate.
```

When logged into the salt master running in the container, `dmidecode` returns the following:

```
[root@salt /]# dmidecode
# dmidecode 2.12-dmifs
/dev/mem: No such file or directory
```

The container is running CentOS 7. Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/saltstack-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) and docker-compose.yml [here](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/saltstack-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
