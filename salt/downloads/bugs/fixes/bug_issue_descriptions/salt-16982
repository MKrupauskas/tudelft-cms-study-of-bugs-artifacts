The bootstrap script doesn't install python systemd bindings package for openSUSE, which is why starting the salt-master process is hanging (similar to #16912). 

@aboe76 - The salt-bootstrap script is using zypper to install the openSUSE deps, but @s0undt3ch and I haven't found a systemd python bindings package. What are you using when you do your packaging for openSUSE?
