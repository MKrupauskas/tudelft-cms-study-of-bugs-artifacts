### Description of Issue/Question

Multiple-master support is documented here:
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster.html

However, in recent versions of salt, a warning is thrown when multiple masters are used:

```
victory:~ root# salt-call saltutil.sync_all
[WARNING ] Key master with value [ ... (list of masters here) ... ] has an invalid type of list, a str is required for this value
```

I don't know if this is indicative of a complete failure though, because our main master is fairly reliable so it's never had a need to fall back to the backup. It does imply at least that specifying multiple masters is an error, which goes against the documentation.
### Setup

In `/etc/salt/minion.d/masters.conf`:

``` yaml
master:
- salt-master
- salt-master-2
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run `salt-call test.ping` or some equally trivial salt call

This seems to be a regression since `2015.8.7`. Tested on Arch Linux too and experiencing the same.
