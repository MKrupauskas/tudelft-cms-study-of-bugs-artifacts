I'm trying to use fileclient.get_url (indirectly via archive.extracted).  The source URL contains authentication info: http://username:password@nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?xxx....
1. The initial call succeeds with authentication
2. The server then issues a redirect where the .tar.gz file is
3. Salt follows the redirect but does not provide the Authorization header
4. The server rejects the call with 401 Unauthorized
5. Salt does not attempt re-calling with the auth info
