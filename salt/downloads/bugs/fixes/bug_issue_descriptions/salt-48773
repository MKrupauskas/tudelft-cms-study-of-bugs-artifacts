I'm running salt 2018.3.2+ds-1 with python 3 on Ubuntu 18.04, and am finding that it takes over 5 seconds to run `salt-call --local test.true`. If I use `--skip-grains`, it cuts the time down to 1 second (which is still somewhat slower than expected). While searching around I came across #26255, but in my case the number of file descriptors isn't the issue -- setting ulimit -n 1024 doesn't fix it. Here's the output from both runs. The numerous `Depends decorator instantiated...` messages seem to chew up most of the time.

### `time salt-call --local test.true -l trace`
