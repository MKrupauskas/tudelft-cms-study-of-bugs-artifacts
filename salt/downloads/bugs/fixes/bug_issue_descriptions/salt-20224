From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/cOpJ7qjD7Gs:

to this point if i had a problem with the svn.latest call, there was always a more or less "clear" error statement, but now i'm stuck with the following:

```
----------
          ID: https://**.**.**.**/svn/System-Shellscripts/trunk/andros/scripts
    Function: svn.latest
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

if i call the following on the minion it gets executed without errors:

```
svn up -r HEAD https://**.**.**.**/svn/System-Shellscripts/trunk/andros/scripts /daten/SVN_PROJECTS/scripts
```

the definition looks like this:

```
https://**.**.**.**/svn/System-Shellscripts/trunk/{{ grains['nodename'] }}/scripts:
  svn.latest:
    - trust: True
    - target: /daten/SVN_PROJECTS/scripts
    - user: root
    - username: svn_ro
    - password: *cleartextpwd*
    - require:
      - file: /root/.subversion/auth/svn.ssl.server/e35bcd20f0e2b12bd5b4a701e2f3bc0e
```

could someone please point me in the right direction?
