Among the results of applying a highstate to a Minion:

```
----------
          ID: endnote
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: endnote=17.1.
     Changes:
----------
```

The value of `Result` and the `Comment` contradict each other.

PR with a fix for this is being tested right now.
