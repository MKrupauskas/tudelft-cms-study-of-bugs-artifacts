`grains.setval key "value"` changes the key value in the gains file on the minion. You can see this updated by viewing the grains file /etc/salt/grains on the minion.

`salt minion grains.get key` outputs the key value 

The issue:

Right now the `grains.get key` does not output updated values until you restart the minion.

This is only happening on a Multi-Master Environment. Testing this with just a master and a minion, `grains.get key` outputs updated key values. 

To replicate:
1. Create a Multi-Master Environment (I tested with 1 minion and 2 masters)
2. From the master execute `salt minion grains.setval key value1` (If it is your first time you might have to use `grains.append key value1`)
3. From the master execute `salt minion grains.get key` (this should output "value1")
4. From the master execute `salt minion grains.setval key value2`
5. From the master execute `salt minion grains.get key`

Result: 
After step 5 the `grains.get key` output will be "value1"
Expectation:
After step 5 I expected the `grains.get key` output to show the updated key "value2"

Workaround:
The workaround for this is: after updated the key value, restart the minion. Doing this, the next time you run 'grains.get key', the updated key value will appear.
