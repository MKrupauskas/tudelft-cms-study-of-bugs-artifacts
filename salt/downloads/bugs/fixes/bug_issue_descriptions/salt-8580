Related to issue #7157.

In the local client calls to SaltEvent.get_event(tag=<jid>) are nested (due to the nested find_job job being run).

While in get_event all unrelated events are consumed but dropped (returns None).

This leads to a race condition where the original job return event can be dropped while listening for the find_job return event.
