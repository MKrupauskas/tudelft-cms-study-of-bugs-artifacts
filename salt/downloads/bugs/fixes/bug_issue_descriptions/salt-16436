If the `salt-master` is ran as user salt and (as root) you run:

```
salt-run fileserver.update
```

To forcibly refresh gitfs, it changes permissions on several directories under `/var/cache/salt`, which cause any minion action afterwards to fail.

Example to reproduce:

``` bash
[root@hostname] # getfacl /var/cache/salt/master/minions/
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: var/cache/salt/master/minions/
# owner: salt
# group: salt
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x

[root@hostname] # salt-run fileserver.update
[root@hostname] # getfacl /var/cache/salt/master/minions/
getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
# file: var/cache/salt/master/minions/
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
```

When this happens, all minions fail with the insanely unhelpful message of:

``` python
[root@minion] # salt-call state.highstate test=true
[ERROR   ] Got a bad pillar from master, type str, expecting dict: 
[ERROR   ] Got a bad pillar from master, type str, expecting dict:

    if not data['data']:

```

So when the master has the `user` setting as non-root, please run the gitfs code as said user so the permissions don't get ruined. Secondly, can the minion catch this a bit more gracefully and say something like, "The master is borka!".

Thanks!
