### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->

In saltstack 2016.11.10 we could do something like this:

     file.write /tmp/foobar 'foo\nbar\nbaz'

and it will write three lines into /tmp/foobar.

We recently upgraded to 2019.2.3 and the string is no longer interpreted so /tmp/foobar ends up with just a single line with control characters.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

    salt -E testminion file.write /tmp/foobar 'foo\nbar\nbaz'

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
