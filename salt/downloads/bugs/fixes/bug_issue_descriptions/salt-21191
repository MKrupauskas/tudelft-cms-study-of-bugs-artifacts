Although it is totally cosmetic, we should filter out those warnings inside virtual or HAS_ switches (i did not read at all the related exec mods code)

```
[ERROR   ] Error loading module.nacl: libnacl import error, perhaps missing python libnacl package
[ERROR   ] Error loading module.ipmi: No module named pyghmi.ipmi

```
