When executing salt-ssh in parallel, lets say in different terminals:

```
salt-ssh '*-[aw]*' pkg.version postgresql93
```

and

```
salt-ssh '*-[aw]*' pkg.version python-pip
```

Both will fail with

```
retcode:
    12
stderr:

    WARNING: checksum mismatch for "/tmp/.root_dcdf8c_salt/salt-thin.tgz"
stdout:

```

or

```
retcode:
    11
stderr:

```

With just one minion it will work, but with a set of minions I see this behaivor.
This seems to go away when the transfer of the thin client (not sure how it's called) to all minions is completed. 
That it works with one minion may be a coincidence. I may have picked a minion where it was already transfered.
