As requested I'm logging an issue I experienced upgrading from 0.15.1 => 0.15.3 via apt-get on Ubuntu 12.04 servers. After upgrading the salt-master and performing a `salt-run manage.key_regen`, all minions failed to cache/trust the masters new public key, meaning the master could no longer issue commands to minions (but minions could salt-call from master).

This was resolved manually by deleting the old pub-key on all minions manually and restarting salt-minion (a time-consuming process).

I can't be 100% certain it wasn't a result of something specific I did when upgrading though ;-)
