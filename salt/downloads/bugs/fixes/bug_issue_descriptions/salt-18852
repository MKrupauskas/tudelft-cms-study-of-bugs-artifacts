The `virtualenv.create` function accepts `python` parameter, which is passed to the underlying virtualenv creation command. On the commadline, I can do something like

```
    $ virtualenv -p python3 env
```

but this doesn't work with the salt virtualenv module because it checks that a file named `python3` exists. Could salt simply pass the parameter through to virtualenv instead?
