Recent versions of Amazon Linux have adopted a completely different numbering scheme than RHEL/CentOS. This causes breakage when using version numbers that are expected to fit the RHEL numbering scheme.

One example:

``` repo.sls
nginx_yum_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: nginx
    - humanname: nginx repo
    - baseurl: 'http://nginx.org/packages/rhel/$releasever/$basearch/'
    - gpgcheck: False
    - enabled: True
```

$releasever right there is expected to be a single digit {5,6,7}. Instead on Amazon Linux it ends up being 2015 or so.
