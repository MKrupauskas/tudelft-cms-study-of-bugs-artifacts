When specifying a SHA hash for a git.latest rev, salt doesn't think the reference is valid.

``` yaml
kibana:
  git.latest:
    - name: https://github.com/rashidkpc/Kibana.git
    - rev: 4f3230d29266017025867d577c7d4d527f097794
    - force: True
    - force_checkout: True
    - target: /mnt/kibana/site
    - runas: kibana
    - require:
      - pkg: git
      - file: /mnt/kibana
```

```
    State: - git
    Name:      https://github.com/rashidkpc/Kibana.git
    Function:  latest
        Result:    False
        Comment:   fatal: reference is not a tree: 4f3230d29266017025867d577c7d4d527f097794
        Changes: 
```

I haven't had a chance to look into this, but when I was specifying a git tag or a git branch for the rev it worked fine.  I'm not even sure what "reference is not a tree" is supposed to mean, but that hash is definitely in the tree (I copypasta'd the hash from git log).
