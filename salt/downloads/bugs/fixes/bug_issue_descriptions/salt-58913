I have written the state file for checking the server status using pid.

```
{% from "maps1.jinja" import HC_CIF_HOME1 %}
{% set path = HC_CIF_HOME1+"/scripts/./check_pid.sh" %}
{% set ret1 = salt ['cmd.shell'] (path) %}
server_status:
{% if ret1 == 1 %}
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo "Server started successfully"
{% endif %}
```

Locally check_pid.sh gives 1  but ret1 is not getting the value 1 here. instead getting the error:
"scripts/./check_pid.sh: line 1: [: -e: binary operator expected".  is the condition I added wrong? if so could any one please direct me to right way?

salt version
3000.3
