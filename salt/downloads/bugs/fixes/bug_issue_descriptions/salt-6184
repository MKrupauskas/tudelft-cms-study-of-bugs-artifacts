version 0.16.0

In using the Windows silent installer I was running the command below on a Windows 2008 R2 vm and noticed salt-minion wasn't running and determined that the hostname/minion name was 'saltpoc-0'. Running the command again with the minion name 'saltpoc0', everything worked as expected. 

Was using this as a silent installer:
Salt-Minion-0.16.0-AMD64-Setup.exe /S /master=10.4.167.xx /minion-name=%COMPUTERNAME%
