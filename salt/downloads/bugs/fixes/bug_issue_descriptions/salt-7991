salt-ssh can't work in python2.6

with tarfile.open(trans_tar, 'w:gz') as tfp:
AttributeError: 'TarFile' object has no attribute '__exit__'
```

that because the TarFile class don't have

```
'__exit__'
```

funtion in python2.6

if fixed that need replace the:

```
with tarfile.open(trans_tar, 'w:gz') as tfp:
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(gendir):
        for name in files:
            full = os.path.join(root, name)
            tfp.add(full[len(gendir):].lstrip(os.sep))
```

to

```
try:
    tfp =  tarfile.open(trans_tar, 'w:gz')
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(gendir):
        for name in files:
            full = os.path.join(root, name)
            tfp.add(full[len(gendir):].lstrip(os.sep))
except Exception, ex:
    print ex
finally:
    tfp.close()
```

in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/client/ssh/state.py file.
