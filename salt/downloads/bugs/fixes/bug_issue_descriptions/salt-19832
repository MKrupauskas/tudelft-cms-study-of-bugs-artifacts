https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/22711eec20a7a152488621324ab6d1fcd64fcd06/salt/utils/network.py#L1070 tries to run lsof when /proc is not available (for example on default installations of *BSD). There are several issues with this:
1) lsof is not installed by default, and the dependency is not mentioned
2) this requires root privileges, thus fails when master is not running as root (default situation on OpenBSD)
