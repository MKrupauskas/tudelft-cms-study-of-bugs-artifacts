**Description**
I am getting python3.8 warnings consistently after running tasks with Salt. I have upgraded from Fedora 31 to 32, which has upgraded Python to version 3.8. It looks like a component of `dictdiffer.py` is being used against best practice and will stop functioning in the way Salt is utilizing it with Python 3.9.


```
2020-04-30 09:35:53,848 [py.warnings      :109 ][WARNING ][24321] /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/salt/utils/dictdiffer.py:16: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated since Python 3.3, and in 3.9 it will stop working
  from collections import Mapping
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
This shows up with normal tasks from Master - the log above was produced during `sudo salt '*' test.ping`
