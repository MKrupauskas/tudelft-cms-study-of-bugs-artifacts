On 2014.7.0, given something like this:

```
mysite-reqs:
  pip.installed:
    - requirements: salt://mysite/requirements.txt
    - user: mysite
    - bin_env: /opt/env/mysite
    - cwd: /opt/env/mysite
```

I get this error:

```
          ID: mysite-reqs
    Function: pip.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: Unable to process requirements file salt://mysite/requirements.txt. Error: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/mysite/requirements.txt'
              Storing debug log for failure in /home/mysite/.pip/pip.log

Examining the locally cached `requirements.txt`, I see it's accessible only by root:

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ sudo ls -lh /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/mysite/requirements.txt
-rw------- 1 root root 36 Jan 15 14:01 /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/mysite/requirements.txt
```

So of course my `mysite` user won't be able to read it.
