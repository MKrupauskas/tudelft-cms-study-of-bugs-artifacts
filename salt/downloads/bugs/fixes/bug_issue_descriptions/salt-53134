### Description of Issue/Question
alternatives.auto state reports changes on every run.  If run with test=True it prints a stack trace if the package that provides the alternative is not installed.
Looks like part of this problem may be found in this issue: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/25504

### Setup
```yaml
java-1.8.0-openjdk:
  pkg.installed: []

  alternatives.auto:
    - name: java
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```bash
# running it repeatedly always indicates changes when there are no actual changes 
salt-call state.sls java8
local:
----------
