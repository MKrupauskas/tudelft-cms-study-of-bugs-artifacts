**Description**
When a user account has not yet been created and is specified as the owner of a directory, `file.directory` reports an error and shows the state as failed in test mode.

**Setup**

```yaml
# /srv/salt/dir.sls

# this user doesn't exist yet
anne:
  user.present

/tmp/anne:
  file.directory:
    - user: anne
    - require:
      - user: anne
```
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Given the sls file above in the file root, this command:

```bash
salt-call state.apply dir test=true
```

returns this output:

```
[ERROR   ] User anne is not available 
local:
----------
          ID: anne
    Function: user.present
      Result: None
     Comment: User anne set to be added
     Started: 15:08:34.221828
    Duration: 20.913 ms
     Changes:   
----------
          ID: /tmp/anne
    Function: file.directory
      Result: False
     Comment: User anne is not available
     Started: 15:08:34.284309
    Duration: 5.662 ms
     Changes:   

Summary for local
------------
Succeeded: 1 (unchanged=1)
Failed:    1
Success %: 50.0
Failure %: 50.0
------------
Total states run:     2
Total run time:  26.575 ms
```

**Expected behavior**
Given that we're running in test mode, failures should not be reported for items which may be addressed in other states.
