Recently we encountered a problem. We deployed salt master and syndic in docker, and salt minion deployed on some physical machines. Recently, we discovered a problem: sometimes minion could not receive the command after sending a command, But minion can receive the command when sent repeatedly for the second time, please help analyze the possible reasons.

Our salt version: salt-2018.3.4
