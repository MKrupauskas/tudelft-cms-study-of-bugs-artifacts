### Description of Issue
With Sodium a new syntax for the "module.run' function will be introduced as indicated by the following message: ``The function "module.run" is using its deprecated version and will expire in version "Sodium"``.
The required changes are described here: (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/releases/2017.7.0.html#state-module-changes)

This new syntax no longer supports the use of keyword arguments in a state. As such, converted states might show very confusing outcomes.
The first argument of the file.copy function is "src" and the second argument ist "dst" (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.file.html#salt.modules.file.copy). In the example below this order is not followed.

### Setup
Given a (windows?) minion with two folders "Source" and "Dest". In each one of those folders there is a file.
We have two states. Both states copy content from folder "Source" to folder "Dest". State "old_copy" uses the old syntax and state "new_copy" uses the new syntax.

```
old_copy:
  module.run:
    - name: file.copy
    - dst: C:/Dest
    - src: C:/Source
    - recurse: True
    - remove_existing: False
```

```
new_copy:
  module.run:
    - file.copy:
      - dst: C:/Dest
      - src: C:/Source
      - recurse: True
      - remove_existing: False
```

Necessary changes to minion config to activate new syntax:
```
use_superseded:
- module.run
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Execute state "old_copy" against the minion. The result will be that the folder "Dest" is containing both it's original files and those from folder "Source".
2. Revert the content of both folders back to its original state
3. Change the minion config to utilize the new module.run syntax
4. Execute state "new_copy" against the minion. The result will be that the folder "Source" is containing both it's original files and those from folder "Dest".
