if you create an invalid module in the modules directory, say the empty directory named error,
the error messaqge from salt is very confusing if you know know the problem.

The internal error message is

> ImportError: No module named error

The log file message is 

> [DEBUG   ] Failed to import module error. Another attempt will be made to try to resolve dependencies.
> [DEBUG   ] Failed to import module error, this is most likely NOT a problem:

The traceaback is

> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "salt/salt/loader.py", line 960, in load_names
>     fn_, path, desc = imp.find_module(name, self.module_dirs)

What i would like to see is 

>  Error occured attempting to load the module named 'error'  from the directory /srv/salt/modules
>  The errror message was : No module named error
