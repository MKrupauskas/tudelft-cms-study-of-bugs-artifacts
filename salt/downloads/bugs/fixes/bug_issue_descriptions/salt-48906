### Description of Issue/Question
As I understand https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blame/develop/salt/utils/network.py#L196 the idea is to get fqdn based on RevDNS and then overwrite it with hostname if it is possible to obtain ip of hostname. But current code does only the first thing and because of that grain fqdn_ip4 could be unavailable in some situations when RevDNS != hostname.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set RevDNS for something different than hostname.
