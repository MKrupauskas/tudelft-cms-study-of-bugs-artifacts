### Description of Issue/Question

since upgrading to 2016.3.0 having issues with upgrading. pkg.upgrade complains about NoneType when ran without an argument. which used to be how to upgrade an entire system. 
### Setup

Centos 7.2

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511 (Core)
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt-call pkg.upgrade

[INFO    ] Executing command ['yum', '--quiet', 'clean', 'expire-cache'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] output:
[INFO    ] Executing command ['yum', '--quiet', 'check-update'] in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command ['rpm', '-qa', '--queryformat', '%{NAME}_|-%{EPOCH}_|-%{VERSION}_|-%{RELEASE}_|-%{ARCH}_|-(none)\n'] in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] No package sources provided

Passed invalid arguments: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.

Usage:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 197, in call
    ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/yumpkg.py", line 1336, in upgrade
    targets = [x for x in pkg_params]
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

    Run a full system upgrade (a ``yum upgrade`` or ``dnf upgrade``), or
    upgrade specified packages. If the packages aren't installed, they will
    not be installed.

    .. versionchanged:: 2014.7.0

    Return a dict containing the new package names and versions::

        {'<package>': {'old': '<old-version>',
                       'new': '<new-version>'}}

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' pkg.upgrade
        salt '*' pkg.upgrade name=openssl

    Repository Options:

    fromrepo
        Specify a package repository (or repositories) from which to install.
        (e.g., ``yum --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='somerepo'``)

    enablerepo (ignored if ``fromrepo`` is specified)
        Specify a disabled package repository (or repositories) to enable.
        (e.g., ``yum --enablerepo='somerepo'``)

    disablerepo (ignored if ``fromrepo`` is specified)
        Specify an enabled package repository (or repositories) to disable.
        (e.g., ``yum --disablerepo='somerepo'``)

    disableexcludes
        Disable exclude from main, for a repo or for everything.
        (e.g., ``yum --disableexcludes='main'``)

        .. versionadded:: 2014.7
    name
        The name of the package to be upgraded. Note that this parameter is
        ignored if "pkgs" is passed.

        32-bit packages can be upgraded on 64-bit systems by appending the
        architecture designation (``.i686``, ``.i586``, etc.) to the end of the
        package name.

        Warning: if you forget 'name=' and run pkg.upgrade openssl, ALL packages
        are upgraded. This will be addressed in next releases.

        CLI Example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' pkg.upgrade name=openssl

        .. versionadded:: 2016.3.0
    pkgs
        A list of packages to upgrade from a software repository. Must be
        passed as a python list. A specific version number can be specified
        by using a single-element dict representing the package and its
        version. If the package was not already installed on the system,
        it will not be installed.

        CLI Examples:

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt '*' pkg.upgrade pkgs='["foo", "bar"]'
            salt '*' pkg.upgrade pkgs='["foo", {"bar": "1.2.3-4.el5"}]'

        .. versionadded:: 2016.3.0

    normalize : True
        Normalize the package name by removing the architecture. This is useful
        for poorly created packages which might include the architecture as an
        actual part of the name such as kernel modules which match a specific
        kernel version.

        .. code-block:: bash

            salt -G role:nsd pkg.install gpfs.gplbin-2.6.32-279.31.1.el6.x86_64 normalize=False

        .. versionadded:: 2016.3.0
```
