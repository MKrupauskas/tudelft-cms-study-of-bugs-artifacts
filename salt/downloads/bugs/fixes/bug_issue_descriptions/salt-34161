### Description of Issue/Question

I have a fleet of ~300 minions and some of them are broken. Two are down and one is somehow screwed to the point where `saltutil` module is not found.

The following command never returns on my master:

```
salt '*' test.ping
```

It does the internal loop, but never times out or prints any new results after the initial batch of healthy minion returns.
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I did some good old `log.debug` style debugging to figure out the reason for this. The relevant function:
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/8f71413/salt/client/__init__.py#L986

I added `log.debug("raw={}".format(raw))`. In the output I saw the following line over and over:

```
[DEBUG   ] raw={'tag': 'salt/job/20160621091134724456/ret/minion-with-the-broken-saltuitl', 'data': {'fun_args': ['20160621090958662043'], 'jid': '20160621091134724456', 'return': "Module 'saltutil' is not available.", 'retcode': 254, 'success': False, 'cmd': '_return', '_stamp': '2016-06-21T09:11:35.120462', 'fun': 'saltutil.find_job', 'id': 'minion-with-the-broken-saltuitl', 'out': 'nested'}}
```

I stopped the minion and `salt` command returned during the next iteration (`timeout_at` time happened), telling me that some (broken or down) salt minions timed out. I started the minion back and it works now, since `saltutil` module is found now.

There's no reason for one broken minion to keep the loop from breaking and it is quite frustrating when you never know which minions did the job and which timed out.
