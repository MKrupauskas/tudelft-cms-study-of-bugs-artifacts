### Description of Issue/Question

Currently the Windows version of the salt-minion provides the wrong type of information for the `cpu_model` grain. I'm pretty sure this has been the case since the earliest versions of Salt on Windows, but I think this should be changed on develop and include a large notice in the release notes.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
root@bouchamaster:~# salt \* grains.item cpu_model
bouchamaster:
    ----------
    cpu_model:
        Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630L 0 @ 2.00GHz
testwin01:
    ----------
    cpu_model:
        Intel64 Family 6 Model 58 Stepping 9, GenuineIntel
```

bouchamaster is a linux vm
testwin01 is a windows vm
