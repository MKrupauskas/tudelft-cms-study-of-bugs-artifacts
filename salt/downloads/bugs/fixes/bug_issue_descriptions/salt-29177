if using profiles like this. 

```
openstack1:
  keystone.user: admin
  keystone.password: verybadpass
  keystone.tenant: admin
  keystone.auth_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2.0/'

openstack2:
  keystone.user: admin
  keystone.password: verybadpass
  keystone.tenant: admin
  keystone.auth_url: 'http://127.0.0.2:5000/v2.0/'
```

glance does not pass the profile to keystone.endpoint_get causing it to fail loading.
