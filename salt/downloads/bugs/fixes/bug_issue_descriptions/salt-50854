### Description of Issue/Question
When the master is not running and the windows minion attempts to connect to the master the process shutsdown and does not continue to try to connect to the master again.

### Setup
I installed windows like so:

`powershell -file build_env_2.ps1`
`pip install -e .`



### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. attach a window minion to a master
2. verify you can run commands from the master to windows minion
3. stop both master and minion
4. start minion `salt-minion -ldebug` and wait for about 5 minutes

and you will see it shutdown:

```
[DEBUG   ] SaltReqTimeoutError, retrying. (1/7)
[ERROR   ] Minion unable to successfully connect to a Salt Master.  Exiting.
[INFO    ] Stopping the Salt Minion
[ERROR   ] Minion unable to successfully connect to a Salt Master.  Exiting.
[INFO    ] Shutting down the Salt Minion
The Salt Minion is shutdown.
Minion unable to successfully connect to a Salt Master.  Exiting.
