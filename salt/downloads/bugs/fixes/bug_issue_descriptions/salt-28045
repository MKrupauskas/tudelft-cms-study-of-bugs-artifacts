The repo URL listed on the Ubuntu installation page (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/ubuntu.html) is incorrect.  

The URL stated is "http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/latest/ubuntu14" which returns a 404.  The repo structure seems to have a "http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/ubuntu14/latest/" which does work.

Also, the message that the repo structure changed is ambiguous and states that the URL should "contain latest", but doesn't say where.

And finally, making silent changes like this and returning 404's for older, deprecated URLs is unpleasant for existing installations which will silently fail, leaving behind old versions.
