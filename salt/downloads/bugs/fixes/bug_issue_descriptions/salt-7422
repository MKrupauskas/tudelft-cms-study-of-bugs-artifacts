I'm not sure if this is a bug or I'm doing something wrong, but I was directed here from the salt-users mailing list. [original discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/vynCM-cUeDE)

I have a bunch of tasks running via the scheduler. They seem to be working fine except for ps.cpu_percent. Here's the snippet of my schedule:

```
schedule: 
  stat_cpu_percent:
    function: ps.cpu_percent 
      kwargs: 
        interval: 5 
        per_cpu: True 
    minutes: 5 
    returner: librato
```

When I run `salt-call --return librato ps.cpu_percent interval=5 per_cpu=True` it works as expected. The scheduler never returns anything as far as I can tell. I've refreshed my pillars, done a config.merge schedule, and even restarted the minion. I did notice that this is the only function that returns a list (instead of a dict) and it also runs longer than any of the others, maybe that could be causing issues? Any thoughts?
