### Description of Issue/Question

Slack API does not return 'is_bot' key for deleted users. This leads to an KeyError. I guess it's the same error which was fixed in this other projects commit: [django-slackin: fix 'is_bot' KeyError](https://github.com/brilliantorg/django-slackin/commit/d0e746aff47108c51a8889632ccdd604eae4553c).
### Setup

Have a slack engine configured in the master settings.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Start the salt master with the new engine configuration

```
