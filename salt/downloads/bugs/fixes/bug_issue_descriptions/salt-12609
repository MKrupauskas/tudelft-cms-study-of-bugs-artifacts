salt verison: salt 2014.1.3
OS: CentOS 6.4

Using the salt state module documented here:

http://salt.readthedocs.org/en/v2014.1.1/ref/states/all/salt.states.svn.html?highlight=svn#module-salt.states.svn

I am creating a Salt State tree that will checkout source code, build a package from that source code, install the package, and then run a set of automation tests on that package. This requires checkouts from two different SVN locations. 

Due to the specific legacy requirements of this product, a base SVN checkout is done into a base working directory and then another svn checkout from a different part of the SVN tree is performed within the that base working directory. 

However, even though the module returns a success on the second checkout, nothing is actually checked out into the base directory. This problem does not occur if the directory is not subversioned (i.e. there is no .svn folder)
