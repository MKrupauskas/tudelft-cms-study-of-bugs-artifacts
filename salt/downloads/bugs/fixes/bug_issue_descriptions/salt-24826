First thing I noticed was that all service states (like service.running in my case) did not work at all on my minions. As I was debugging another issue, I noticed something in the startup log when I call: `salt-call state.highstate`:

```
[ERROR   ] Exception raised when processing __virtual__ function for rh_service. Module will not be loaded 'int' object has no attribute 'startswith'
[WARNING ] salt.loaded.int.module.rh_service.__virtual__() is wrongly returning `None`. It should either return `True`, `False` or a new name. If you're the developer of the module 'rh_service', please fix this.
```

Following this, also the service module itself just re-writes the error:

```
[ERROR   ] Exception raised when processing __virtual__ function for service. Module will not be loaded expected string or buffer
[WARNING ] salt.loaded.int.module.service.__virtual__() is wrongly returning `None`. It should either return `True`, `False` or a new name. If you're the developer of the module 'service', please fix this.
```
