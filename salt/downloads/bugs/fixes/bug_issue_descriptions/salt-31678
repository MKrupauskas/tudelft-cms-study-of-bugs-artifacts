### Description of Issue/Question

If a Salt minion does not recognize the OS, very strange messages are given to the user like:

```
[ERROR   ] State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'hypervisor-kvm'
Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False
```

The real problem is the unknown OS:

```
[DEBUG   ] Error loading module.rh_service: Cannot load rh_service module: OS not in set(['SUSE  Enterprise Server', 'SUSE', 'RedHat', 'CentOS', 'CloudLinux', 'McAfee  OS Server', 'XenServer', 'Amazon', 'OEL', 'ScientificLinux', 'ALT', 'Fedora'])
```

An unknown OS should definitely lead to all further actions being stopped with a proper error message.

The deeper problem seems to be the strange way the Python _platform.py_ module tries to identify the OS by [just querying the first line](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/platform.py#l335) of e.g. `/etc/os-release`. On Rockstor linux this is the content:

```
# cat /etc/os-release 
NAME="Rockstor"
VERSION="3 (Core)"
ID="rockstor"
ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"
VERSION_ID="3"
PRETTY_NAME="Rockstor 3 (Core)"
ANSI_COLOR="0;31"
CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:rockstor:rockstor:3"
HOME_URL="https://www.rockstor.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://www.rockstor.com/"
```

I guess it would be much easier to query the `ID` instead and, if that is unknown, check for `ID_LIKE`.

My current workaround for Rockstor: I statically set the OS name and release info:

```
# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/set-osname.conf
grains:
  os: CentOS
  os_family: RedHat
  osmajorrelease: 7
  osrelease: 7.2
  osrelease_info:
   - 7
   - 2
   - 1511
```
### Setup
- [Rockstor](http://rockstor.com/) installed with Salt minion
- Simple SLS file on master, e.g.

```
mc:
  pkg.installed: []
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Take any system with a Salt Minion installed and do this:

```
cat <<EOF > /etc/salt/minion.d/test-osname.conf
grains:
  os: MyOS 
  os_family: Kelly
EOF

salt-call -l debug --local state.single pkg.installed name=mc
```
