### Description of Issue/Question

It's common to see output like this:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [chown root:root '/var/cache/swap/swap.img' && chmod 0600 '/var/cache/swap/swap.img'
] at time 10:59:40.421129
[INFO    ] Executing state cmd.run for chown root:root '/var/cache/swap/swap.img' && chmod 0600 '/var/cache/swap/swap.img'

[INFO    ] Executing command 'test -f '/var/cache/swap/swap.img' && ! stat --printf='%u:%g,%A\n' '/var/cache/swap/swap.img' | grep -q '0:0,-rw-------'
' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] onlyif execution failed
[INFO    ] Completed state [chown root:root '/var/cache/swap/swap.img' && chmod 0600 '/var/cache/swap/swap.img'
] at time 10:59:40.426596 duration_in_ms=5.467

```

This was generated from:

```
Set swap image file permissions:
{#
# AFAICT, file.managed (at least in salt 2014.1.13) causes the entire
# file to be read into RAM. If the swap file is already used, this
# will cause the OOM killer to start nuking things, wreaking havoc and
# effectively disabling the instance. Hence, we use cmd.run for this:
#}
  cmd.run:
    - name: >
        chown root:root '{{ file_path }}' &&
        chmod 0600 '{{ file_path }}'
    - onlyif: >
        test -f '{{ file_path }}' &&
        ! stat --printf='%u:%g,%A\n' '{{ file_path }}' |
        grep -q '0:0,-rw-------'
    - watch:
      - cmd: Add a swap image
```

It can be very difficult to read at times due to all the line breaks, especially when you have a bunch of statements such as this. This small section of code has produced four additional line breaks in the INFO log output.
### Setup

No setup required. Just use some YAML block scalars with the `>` indentation modifier (extremely useful to avoid long lines in code) and you will get unwanted new lines in the log.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Just run a state with a YAML indentation modifier as above.
