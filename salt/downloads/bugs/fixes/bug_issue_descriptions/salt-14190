This has taken me some time to a nail down and to create a minimum test example:

I have the following state:

**crash.sls**

```
/tmp/a:
  file:
    - touch
    - prereq:
      - file: /tmp/c
      - file: /tmp/b

/tmp/b:
  file:
    - touch
    - prereq:
      - file: /tmp/c

/tmp/c:
  file:
    - touch
```

The only file that has content is `/tmp/c`:

``` bash
/tmp$ cat a b c
cat: a: No such file or directory
cat: b: No such file or directory
hej
```

Executing

```
$ salt myminion state.sls crash test=True
```

Makes my minion log end with:

```

The output from the `salt state.sls ...` invocation is simply `myminion:`.

Additional information:
- Removing the state `/tmp/b` (and the `prereq` reference it in `/tmp/a`) does not trigger this behaviour.
- Removing the state `/tmp/a` (and the `prereq` reference it in `/tmp/a`) does not trigger this behaviour.
