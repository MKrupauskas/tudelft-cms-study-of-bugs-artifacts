All,
   Changing or adding data to pillar entires for a client that only has salt-ssh functionality 
does not seem to affect the client until I remove or move the 
/var/cache/salt/master/minions/MINION_NAME/data.p 
on the master. 

saltutil.sync_all 
saltutil.refresh_pillar

both did not update the information.

Master is 0.17.5 - and again there is no minion for this client (its an older version of 
openindiana). 

Please let me know if I can provide more information.
