I'm trying to run a multi-master environment where I have for syndic servers and one master of masters and each minion connects to two syndic servers.

```

```

If I run `salt-call --master=salt-syndic1.domain.tld state.highstate`, I'll get that error. However, running `salt-call --master=salt.domain.tld state.highstate`, it will work fine. So, against the syndic servers, I can't get anything to work. Against the master of masters, things work fine.

It looks like it's getting upset here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.1/salt/fileclient.py#L941

Both master, syndics, and minions are on 2014.1.4. I also tested this against the current develop.

Also... sometimes when I run against a syndic server, I'll get the following error.

```
