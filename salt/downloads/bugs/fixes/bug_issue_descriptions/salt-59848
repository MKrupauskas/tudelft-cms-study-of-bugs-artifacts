When using pre-commit, it appears to be skipping all files in salt/modules, as well as some other files, and I cannot find out why.
If you run "black ." in salt/modules you will see that ~89 files need reformatting but for some reason, the current pre-commit config is completely skipping this.

salt/modules does not appear in any exclude lists so this is odd.
