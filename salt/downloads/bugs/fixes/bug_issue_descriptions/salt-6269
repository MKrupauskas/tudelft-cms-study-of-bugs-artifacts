Looks like the change from lsb_codename to lsb_distrib_codename didn't get updated in the ppa state module.

```
State: - pkgrepo
Name:      nginx_ppa
Function:  managed
    Result:    False
    Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1237, in call
    _cdata['args'], *_cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/pkgrepo.py", line 199, in managed
    sanitizedkwargs = **salt**['pkg.expand_repo_def'](repokwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/apt.py", line 1189, in expand_repo_def
    dist = **grains**['lsb_codename']
KeyError: 'lsb_codename'

The lsb_\* grains look like this:

lsb_distrib_codename:
    precise
lsb_distrib_description:
    Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
lsb_distrib_id:
    Ubuntu
lsb_distrib_release:
    12.04

This is salt 0.16.0 installed from the PPA.

Finally, here's the state that triggered the error:

nginx_ppa:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - ppa: nginx/stable
    - require_in:
      - pkg: nginx
