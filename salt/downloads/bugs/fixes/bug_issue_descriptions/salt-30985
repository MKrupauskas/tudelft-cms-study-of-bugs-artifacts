Hey Guys, @UtahDave @twangboy @jfindlay 

The "new" repo.saltstack.com repo is a great step forward. Thanks for creating it.

**BUT the current setup is totally unacceptable, I think, sorry.**

`You appear to immediately overwrite and remove any older *.deb or *.rpm files. That is a BIG problem! As production systems can be "stuck" for days on an official release with such a regression`

For example in the case of a regression, or severeal regressions in succession, one cannot simply go "back" to an earlier relase, and is "stuffed", until such a time as you happen to get a "good" build relased.

I think you should think very seriously about two aspects of this.
1. There should always be a channel where the relevant RCs can be obtained from, so that more people can try those upcoming releases on their labs and test on VMs etc, to catch more regressions, before the new version gets offically released. 
   Maybe it doesn't actually need to be a full addional `"test" / "devel" / "rc"` repo, maybe you could include the files required for package building for linux,windows, mac into the salt github repo? so that people can build daily or snapshot or RC builds and deploy them locally and test and feedback what regressions or packaging issues they find. 
   Having said that, I think having a place to go to where the test/devel/rc rpms and debs and exes are already built, would be much better of course and I am sure woudl lead to better feedback and early warning about regressions in upcoming releases.
2. and finally, there should always be an archive per OS of all older rpms and debs files available online somewhere, so that at any time, one can recover or simply go back, for whatever reason, to a previously working version and setup. 
   Maybe simply adding  an archive section, with the release version number as a  subdirectory  name that contains all the rpms and debs packages, might be all it takes.

I searched the existing issues before raising this one and found that at least the following two issues, already raise parts of this and might contain better or more useful suggestions for resolution of the problem.
Make packaging/build processes for repo.saltstack.com more transparent
