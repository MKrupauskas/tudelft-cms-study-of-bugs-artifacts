### Description of Issue/Question
Related to #41922. 

More specifically there is [special casing](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2010b37e6f4dde002032d82948872174382e7da3/salt/utils/verify.py#L244) in `verify_env` that purposefully ignores the job cache when setting permissions. Furthermore, if the job cache does not already exist it will be created with the default `umask` (typically `022`) allowing for world readability of the job cache. This seems a bit untoward given that the job cache is likely to contain sensitive information.

It looks like this was put in as part of a fix to #11804 but considering this is only done at startup I don't see how it would have an impact on the _runtime_ performance of the Salt master.

### Setup
Default

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1) Spin up a fresh salt master
2) Check the permissions on `cachedir`
