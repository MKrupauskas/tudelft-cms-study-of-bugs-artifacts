When using an external_auth provider like rest which inserts usernames and their ACLs into the **opts** dict during runtime, these are not available to rest_cherrypy.

My assumption is that rest_cherrypy runs separate from master and is loading it's own copy of the master opts, instead of using the same dict-object as the salt master. So any username inserted at runtime is not accessible to rest_cherrypy.
