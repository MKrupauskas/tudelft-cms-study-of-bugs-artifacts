In the code fstype is initialized to None, but then is checked against _is_fstype before checking if it's not None, which results in returning always and error
```python
if not _is_fstype(fs_type):
        raise CommandExecutionError(
            'Invalid fs_type passed to partition.mkpart'
        )
```
