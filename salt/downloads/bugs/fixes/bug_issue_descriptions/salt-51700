### Description of Issue/Question
As of yesterday the Firefox chocolatey package is busted in some way that results in `choco list firefox` not finding anything. Not salt's fault or anything, but this results in `chocolatey.version` throwing an exception when `salt.states.installed` calls `salt.chocolatey.version` to check to see if there's a newer version available.

This is a problem because it results in an error that is only reproducable if the third party repository is busted in some way which prevents the `chocolatey.installed` state from being used.

### Setup
This could be hard to reproduce as you need a chocolatey package installed that is then suddenly not listable. As of right now (2019/02/18T05:21:00), the Firefox package is currently in this state. Specifically you'll need `choco list $PACKAGE` to be unable to list the package, but `choco version $PACKAGE` to be able to list it. (Package installed but either it is deprecated or not available by some other means).

```C:\ProgramData\chocolatey>choco list firefox
Chocolatey v0.10.11
0 packages found.

C:\ProgramData\chocolatey>choco list Firefox
Chocolatey v0.10.11
0 packages found.

C:\ProgramData\chocolatey>choco list | findstr /i firefox
Firefox 65.0.1 [Approved]
...
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Once you get the specific conditions to occur (a package installed that is suddenly not available in the repository), then you can either create a state for `chocolatey.installed` with `name` set to your target package any apply it, or you can call `chocolatey.version` your package name specified directly and `check_remote` set to `true` which simulates the call that salt.states.chocolatey.installed makes to check the version:

```
$ salt $t chocolatey.version 'Firefox' check_remote=true

    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\minion.py", line 1607, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\executors\direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\chocolatey.py", line 936, in version
        'available': available[pkg]}
    KeyError: u'firefox'
```
