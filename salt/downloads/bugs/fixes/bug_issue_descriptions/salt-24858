When issuing `salt '*' virt.init name 1 1024 salt://image.img`, I noticed that it was filling the / partition on the hypervisor. The image itself is sparse, or thin provisioned, and using rsync without the --sparse flag results in it shipping 50G, as opposed to 1G, which is the file size on the salt master. 

I tried searching the project for sparse to see if it was an option already, to no avail. 
Is this already resolved somehow as well for salt-cloud? 

Thank you in advance for any feedback you might have.
