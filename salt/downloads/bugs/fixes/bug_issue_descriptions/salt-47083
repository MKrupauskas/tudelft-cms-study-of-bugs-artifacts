### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup

After dirty patching issue reported in #47079, I found myself still unable to highstate minions running Gentoo. It looks like `pkg.list_pkgs` output changed leading `pkg.installed` to think that package have failed to install while they are actually already installed.
The problem manifests in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/pkg.py#L816 where cver is None because it cannot find a key with just the package name (category/package in Gentoo) as it is present but with the version appended  (category/package-version in Gentoo).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

On a 2017.7 minion:
```
$ sudo salt-call --local pkg.list_pkgs
local:
    ----------
    app-accessibility/accerciser:
        3.22.0
    app-accessibility/at-spi2-atk:
        2.24.1
    app-accessibility/at-spi2-core:
        2.24.1
[...]
```

On a 2018.3 minion:
```
$ sudo salt-call --local pkg.list_pkgs
local:
    ----------
    app-admin/apg-2.3.0b-r5:
        2.3.0b-r5
    app-admin/eselect-1.4.11:
        1.4.11
    app-admin/lib_users-0.10:
        0.10
    app-admin/logrotate-3.13.0:
        3.13.0
[...]
```
