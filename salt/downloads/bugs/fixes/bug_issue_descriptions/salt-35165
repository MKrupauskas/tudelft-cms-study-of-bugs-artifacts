### Description of Issue/Question

Running `salt-run jobs.exit_success $JID` does not appear to return any data. This might be because it checks the jobs `retcode` rather than `result` as documented in https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/writing.html#return-data
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `salt-run jobs.exit_success $JID` for a job listed in `salt-run jobs.list_jobs`.
