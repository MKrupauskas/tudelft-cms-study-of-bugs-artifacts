```

Both my master and minion run debian.7.6.

My problem is that my reactors don't seem to work for the salt/cloud part, salt/minion reactors work fine
I'll add my reactor code, they are really simple and nearly copy-pasted from the reactors doc

```
#salt/master.d/reactor.conf
reactor:

  - 'salt/cloud/*/deploy_script':
    - '/srv/reactor/sync_all.sls'
  - 'salt/cloud/*/created':
    - '/srv/reactor/cloud_highstate.sls'
```

```
 ~ # cat /srv/reactor/sync_all.sls
# /srv/reactor/sync_all.sls
sync_all:
  cmd.saltutil.sync_all:
    - tgt: {{ data['id'] }}
    - ret: smtp_return
```

```
 ~ # cat /srv/reactor/cloud_highstate.sls
# /srv/reactor/cloud_highstate.sls
cloud_highstate:
  cmd.state.highstate:
    - tgt: {{ data['id'] }}
    - ret: smtp_return
```

When I create an instance through salt-cloud, I can see my master getting the events that I watch for. (I'm using eventlisten.py form the docs (added an if tag != salt/auth around the display info, because this was just making my head spin, since I have many more servers that I provision with salt.)
This is the info I get from this script:

```
Event fired at Mon Oct 20 10:16:58 2014
*************************
Tag: salt/cloud/servername/deploy_script
Data:
{'_stamp': '2014-10-20T10:16:58.967865',
 'event': 'servername has been deployed at 188.225.186.178',
 'host': '188.225.186.178',
 'name': 'servername'}
Event fired at Mon Oct 20 10:16:59 2014
*************************
Tag: salt/cloud/servername/created
Data:
{'_stamp': '2014-10-20T10:16:59.026587',

 'name': 'servername',
 'profile': 'debian_512_do',
 'provider': 'do:digital_ocean'}
Event fired at Mon Oct 20 10:17:33 2014
```

These events should trigger my reactors, right?
