In short, performing a lookup_jid via the api is failing, with this message:

```
{u'return': [u'Exception occurred in runner jobs.lookup_jid: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 337, in low\n    data[\'return\'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)\nTypeError: lookup_jid() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)\n']}
```

I was using salt-api_2015.8.0+ds-1_all.deb from repo.saltstack.com along with the master and dependencies from the same version via doing an apt-get install on the salt-master and salt-api, and restarting the services.
