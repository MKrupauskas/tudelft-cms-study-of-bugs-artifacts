### Description of Issue/Question

The `postfix` module's `set_main` function overwrites wrong keys in addition to the key it should overwrite. The reason is that Postfix' keys aren't prefix-free, but the `set_main` function assumes they are.

### Setup

First create a dummy `main.cf` file, e.g. `/tmp/test.cf`, and add the following content:

```
virtual_transport_rate_delay = $default_transport_rate_delay
virtual_transport = virtual
```

Those are default values for two keys from an Ubuntu installation as given by `postconf | grep virtual`.

Next, try setting `virtual_transport` while leaving `virtual_transport_rate_delay` as-is:

```
[0 mbunkus@reliant ~] sudo salt-call postfix.set_main virtual_transport testme path=/tmp/test.cf
local:
    - virtual_transport = testme
    - virtual_transport = testme
```

The output already shows that two keys are replaced, not just one. Looking at the file via `cat /tmp/test.cf` confirms it:

```
[0 mbunkus@reliant ~] cat /tmp/test.cf
virtual_transport = testme
virtual_transport = testme
```

### Analysis

The problem is that `set_main` assumes that keys are prefix-free. While iterating over the list of lines, it uses `line.startswith(key)` as the test whether or not to replace the line. This test is obviously true for `virtual_transport = …`, but unfortunately it's also true for any other key whose name starts with `virtual_transport`, such as the aforementioned `virtual_transport_rate_delay = …`

Remedy: don't use `startswith(key)`; rather use something like "starts with the key followed by a whitespace or an equal", e.g. `re.match("^{0}[\\s=]".format(re.escape(key)), line)`. The regex could be compiled earlier in the function, of course.

Yeah, these are the 16.04 Salt packages on Ubuntu 18.04. However, the same code is still present in [today's git](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/postfix.py#L298); therefore the problem still exists.
