### Description of Issue/Question

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/6a5e0f9ac11e7731b759d7dcc873c07f6436ba1b introduces a regression that breaks the Vault module for salt masterless.

Since https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/6a5e0f9ac11e7731b759d7dcc873c07f6436ba1b, we get the following error message running `salt-call --local state.apply`:

        [CRITICAL] Rendering SLS 'foo' failed, render error:
        Problem running salt function in Jinja template: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem'; line 9

        [...]
            foo:
              - "{{ salt.sdb.get('sdb://my-vault/secret/foo?value') }}"    <======================
        ---

### Setup

We use [Packer](https://packer.io) to generate machine images, with Salt masterless for configuration management. This change prevents us from being able to build new images because it breaks the Vault module for Salt masterless.
