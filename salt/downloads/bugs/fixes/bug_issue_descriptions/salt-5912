In states/selinux.py, it appears that something is changing the state value to "None" instead of "True" or "On" as specified in the .sls file.

From salt-call debug I see 

```
[DEBUG   ] Rendered data from file: /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/webserver/selinux.sls:
httpd_can_network_connect:
  selinux.boolean:
    - value: true
    - persist: true
.
.
.
[INFO    ] Executing command 'setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect None' in directory '/root'

local:

    State: - selinux
    Name:      httpd_can_network_connect
    Function:  boolean
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Failed to set the boolean httpd_can_network_connect to None
        Changes:
```

I'm not really familiar with Python but I'm seeing this in the states\selinux.py file around line 125:

``` python
    if __opts__['test']:
        ret['result'] = None
        ret['comment'] = 'Boolean {0} is set to be changed to {1}'.format(
                name, value)
        return ret
```

So it appears that the value coming from selinux.sls in the state tree is being replaced by "None" in the state module.  It's also possible that I'm reading that completely wrong and have an incorrect syntax in my state file, but I've tested various configurations with no change.
