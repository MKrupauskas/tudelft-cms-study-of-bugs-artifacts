### Description of Issue

When I use `salt-cloud` to create or destroy a minion (in EC2), I get the following three warnings from the same line of code:

```
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/xmlutil.py:30: DeprecationWarning: This method will be removed in future versions.  Use 'list(elem)' or iteration over elem instead.
  if len(xmltree.getchildren()) < 1:

[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/xmlutil.py:30: DeprecationWarning: This method will be removed in future versions.  Use 'list(elem)' or iteration over elem instead.
  if len(xmltree.getchildren()) < 1:

[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/xmlutil.py:30: DeprecationWarning: This method will be removed in future versions.  Use 'list(elem)' or iteration over elem instead.
  if len(xmltree.getchildren()) < 1:
```

This is not fatal, of course. The minion is created or destroyed correctly. 

A note about the deprecation can be seen in the docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.getchildren).

A search through the develop branch shows additional use of `getchildren` in `salt/modules/bamboohr.py`, `salt/modules/win_lgpo.py`, and `salt/utils/aws.py`. I haven't yet encountered the warning from these files. (The master branch also has it in `salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py`.)

I can suppress the warnings by changing e.g. `xmltree.getchildren()` to `list(xmltree)` in `xmlutil.py`. I'd be happy to submit a PR to remove uses of `getchildren` in this and the other files, but I thought I'd file a ticket first in case there are aspects I haven't thought of.

### Setup
Working cloud providers and profiles for AWS.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run
```
sudo salt-cloud --out=json --script-args="-xpython3" -p <profile> <minion_id>
