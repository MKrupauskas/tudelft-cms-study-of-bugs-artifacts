Hello,

This is a follow-up of the thread I started on the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/u8mwQeEkOY8.

My environment is FreeBSD 9.2:
`$ uname -a
FreeBSD denica 9.2-RELEASE-p1 FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE-p1 #0: Fri Nov 22 04:01:22 EET 2013     root@:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  i386`

I installed salt 0.17.2 from sysutils/py-salt port. My file_roots reside at /usr/local/etc/salt/states and I have top.sls and common.sls files in it:

```
# cat top.sls 
base:
  '*':
    -  common
# cat common.sls 
vim:
  pkg:
    -  installed
```

I specified the pkg provider in minion's configuration file as pkgng:

```
providers:
  pkg: pkgng
```

When I run "salt '*' state.highstate"I get the following error:

```
# salt '*' state.highstate
denica.lan:
----------
    State: - pkg
    Name:      vim
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1258, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 459, in installed
    **kwargs)
TypeError: install() got an unexpected keyword argument 'skip_verify'
```

I also ran

```
/usr/local/bin/salt-call -l debug state.single pkg.installed name=vim
```

and the result is the same error.

I created a gist with the debug logs at https://gist.github.com/rambius/7601185.

Thank you very much for your help.

Rambius
