My custom outputter doesn't seem to work even though I am sure that it was shiped during "salt-call saltutil.sync_all" and is present in `/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/outputputters` (but no .pyc so it hasn't been loaded). 

Looking at a call with log all, I can see 

```
[TRACE   ] loading output in ['/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/output', '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/output']
```

Is this list not missing  `/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/outputputters`

Taking a look at `loader.py` where there might be a problem in `def outputters`.
