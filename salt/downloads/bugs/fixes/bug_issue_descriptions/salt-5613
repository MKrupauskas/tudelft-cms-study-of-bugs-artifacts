Related to #5612, 

If you say

```
ssh-chroot:
  file.directory:
    - name: /var/lib/svn-chroot
    - mode: "000"
```

you get 

```
----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /var/lib/svn-chroot
    Function:  directory
        Result:    False
        Comment:   Failed to change mode to 0
        Changes:
```

(but it works when you just say `- mode: 0`)
