  I wanted to test some code before actually executing it, and hence used test=True. The service had a watch for the config file and the package. The output from salt-ssh with test=True would say the service is going to get restarted if the file is going to change, but won't when the package is going to change. Yet when salt-ssh is run without test=True the service is restarted for the package.

The reason for nginx.conf.test instead of nginx.conf is that the package upgrade will change the file. That would invalidate the test.

These tests were run with Fedora 34 locally and Fedora 34 remotely. Though I don't think this issue is Fedora specific or has anything to do with nginx. They are just used in the test case.

**COMMANDS**
Run on fqdn and it installs nginx-1.18.0-5.fc34:
```
dnf --disablerepo=updates install nginx
```

Works as expected:
```
salt-ssh -i fqdn state.apply nginx

Run this and see that it says it will restart the service for the file when it didn't with test=True for the package:
```
salt-ssh -i fqdn state.apply nginx test=True
