### Description of Issue/Question

UTF-8 in contents_pillar is broken in 2018.3.3. Before the last upgrade it worked.

I've also tried to set  `- encoding: utf-8` in the state file. But this didn't change the behaviour.

### Setup and steps to reproduce

```
root@minion:~# cat /srv/salt/motd.sls 
---
/etc/motd:
  file.managed:
    - contents_pillar: motd

root@minion:~# file /srv/pillar/file_tree/hosts/minion/motd
/srv/pillar/file_tree/hosts/minion/motd: UTF-8 Unicode text

root@minion:~# salt-call pillar.get motd
local:
    abcäöü

root@minion:~# salt-call state.apply motd
