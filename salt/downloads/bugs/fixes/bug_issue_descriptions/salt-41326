### Description of Issue/Question
If a member of a nodegroup doesn't exist Salt doesn't give any notification of that fact.

For example, if I run a command against a non-existing minion directly I get a notification like this:
```
[me@me ~]$ sudo salt 'ghostminion' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
If I set up a nodegroup like this:
```
[me@me ~]$ cat /etc/salt/master.d/nodegroup_info.conf 
nodegroups:
  group1: 'L@dasalt,cent6test,ghostminion'
```
`dasalt` and `cent6test` are minions with their keys accepted by the master. The `ghostminion` doesn't exist at all.
```
[me@me ~]$ sudo salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
cent6test
dasalt
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
```
I shutdown `cent6test` then run a command against the nodegroup.
```
[me@me ~]$ sudo salt -N group1 test.ping
dasalt:
    True
cent6test:
    Minion did not return. [Not connected]
```

There is no mention of the `ghostminion` minion. There should be a notification stating the `ghostminion` is `[Not connected]` or doesn't exist somehow.

I've tested this on 2016.3.5 2016.11.4
