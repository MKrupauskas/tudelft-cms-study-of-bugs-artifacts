The current code blocks the detailed query of aws and defaults to list_nodes_min.
I dont see the point of a code looking for opts 'selected_query_option',  am not using this from the cli.
this sample code does not run the full query.

Also the default path for clould client is null but the code crashs if you dont pass in a path, that should not be allowed.

```
from salt.cloud import CloudClient
cl = CloudClient("/etc/salt/cloud")
nodes = cl.full_query()
```
