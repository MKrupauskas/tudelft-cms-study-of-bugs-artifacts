The GPG renderer seems to only work on Linux systems. I'm having trouble getting it to work on FreeBSD without changes to the actual code. For example, it refers specifically to a hard-coded path of `/etc/salt/gpgkeys`, whereas FreeBSD should be found in `/usr/local/etc/salt/gpgkeys`.

I've made that change on my local system and still having problems. I'll dig in more and may append to this ticket later, but to begin with the hard-coded path should be fixed.
