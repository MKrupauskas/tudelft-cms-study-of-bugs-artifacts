Setup:
Master: Debian with 2014.1.5+ds-1~bpo70+1
Minion: RHEL 6.5 with salt-minion-2014.1.4-1.el6.noarch

Almost all command regarding states fail. 

Example:

# salt-call state.show_highstate 
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', *\* skipped *\* latest already in cache 'salt://top.sls'
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'dev', *\* skipped *\* latest already in cache 'salt://top.sls'
Passed invalid arguments: 'bool' object is not iterable

On the master's log i get:
2014-06-18 15:19:46,896 [salt.master                                 ][ERROR   ] Received function _ext_nodes which is unavailable on the master, returning False

From 2014.4 to 2014.5 this function is missing from what i can see in the code.
Is it possible to make these Versions compatible? On RHEL the epel repo is always a bit behind, so i'm not able to install a newer version really...

Greetings
