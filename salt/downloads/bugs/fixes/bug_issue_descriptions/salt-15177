The Salt master is reporting this state having completed successfully, but remoting into the server indicates that it did not join the domain. The relevant contents of my `sls` file:

``` yaml
Join Domain:
  module.run:
    - name: system.join_domain
    - domain: mydomain.com
    - username: username
    - passwd: mypass
    - account_ou: 'CN=Computers,DC=blah,DC=com'
    - account_exists: false
```

The output from `highstate`:

``` yaml
----------
          ID: Join Domain
    Function: module.run
        Name: system.join_domain
      Result: True
     Comment: Module function system.join_domain executed
     Changes:   
```

I came across this email thread, but an issue does not appear to have been filed.

Maybe someone needs to open a new issue on the documentation as well. I have to change `password` to `passwd` for this to work.
