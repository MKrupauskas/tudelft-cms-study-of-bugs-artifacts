After upgrading to 2014.1.3 I started noticing problems with some of my minions.  There were failing on any states that did anything with packages.  I ended up tracking it down to the repoquery command not returning any results.  Here is the specific command salt was running:

repoquery --queryformat="%{NAME}_|-%{VERSION}_|-%{RELEASE}_|-%{ARCH}_|-%{REPOID}" --all --pkgnarrow=installed

on a working system this would get you a list of RPMs.  On the systems failing you would get no output back.

All of my systems that were having issues were running yum-utils 1.1.16-14.  Upgrading to 1.1.16-21 fixed the issue for me and I now get the expected output from that repoquery command.  This was only on RHEL/Cent 5.x servers, it did not seem to effect any of my 6.x servers.
