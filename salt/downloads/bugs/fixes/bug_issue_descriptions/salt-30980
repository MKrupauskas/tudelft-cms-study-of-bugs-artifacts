Hi all,

i have problems with the win_wua module on german minions

i think the Installation on a german windows fails because most of the updates have a umlauts in the title, after the log.debug call the i get a encoding error.

`log.debug('\tTitle: {0}'.format(update.Title))`

Heres a example:
Salt module called from master
`sudo salt 'SERVER2008R2GUI' win_wua.install_update guid=3f871267-bbea-4463-8b68-99b14fc650bf`

```
 SERVER2008R2GUI:
     The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\minion.py", line 1039, in _thread_return
         return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
       File "c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\modules\win_wua2.py", line 735, in install_update
         return install_updates([guid])
       File "c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\modules\win_wua2.py", line 811, in install_updates
         log.debug('\tTitle: {0}'.format(update.Title))
     UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xfc' in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)
```

i copied the win_wua module and changed some of the log.debug lines to unicode afterwards it works.

`log.debug('\tTitle: {0}'.format(update.Title))`
`log.debug(u'\tTitle: {0}'.format(update.Title))`

**win_update state**
similar problem with the win_update state

here's the state file

```
updates:
  win_update.installed:
    - categories:
      - 'Critical Updates'
      - 'Security Updates'
      - 'Updates'
      - 'Update Rollups'
      - 'Windows Server 2012 R2'
    - retries: 1
```

executing the state on the german windows also fails

`sa@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'SERVER2008R2GUI' state.sls test2`

```
