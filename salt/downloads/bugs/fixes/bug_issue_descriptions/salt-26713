This block causes a regression in 2015.8 rc3 for my states:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/686df5ff6d71e43f260ec00f0cfc147c8f7f457b#diff-4fa10950085c08ad21a3a55273578adcR250

Because `identity` can be a list (ref: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/686df5ff6d71e43f260ec00f0cfc147c8f7f457b/salt/modules/git.py#L40 ) the call to check `os.path.isabs` is failing. If `identity` is a list, it's acceptable to check that each path within that list is absolute, but it's not OK to check the list itself.

Please treat this with high priority. It is a regression from 2015.8 rc2.
