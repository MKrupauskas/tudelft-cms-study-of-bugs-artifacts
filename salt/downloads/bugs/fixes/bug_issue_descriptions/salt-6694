it seems that entering package names that are not made out of ascii you get a error while logging an error.

```
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1208, in call *cdata['args']
    , **cdata['kwargs'])
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 361, in installed
     **kwargs)
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/yumpkg.py", line 529, in install
    log.error('Install failed: {0}'.format(e))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xfc' in position 38: ordinal not in range(128)
```

in my humble opinion it should state the actual problem.
