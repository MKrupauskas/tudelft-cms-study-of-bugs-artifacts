Salt version 2014.7.4

To reproduce the problem I'm running salt in masterless mode. I've configured the following in /etc/salt/minion

```
ext_pillar:
    - s3:
        bucket: salt-pillars
        keyid: AKI***
        key: Fok***
        multiple_env: True
        verify_ssl: True
```

I have the bucket set up with /base/top.sls, /base/test.sls.

/base/top.sls:

```
base:
  '*':
    - test
```

/base/test.sls:

```
testing:
  - yes: very
```

When I run `salt-call pillar.get test -l debug` it downloads the top.sls and test.sls files to `/var/cache/salt/minion/pillar_s3fs/base/salt-pillars/base/top.sls`. Then at pillars/s3.py:132 opts['pillar_roots'][environment] = [pillar_dir]. At this point pillar_dir is set to `/var/cache/salt/minion/pillar_s3fs/base/salt-pillars`. That is the parent directory of what should be the actual root in the case of multiple_env. I believe the correct code is:

```
opts['pillar_roots'][environment] = [os.path.join(pillar_dir, environment)] if multiple_env else [pillar_dir]
```

I'll try to submit a PR once I figure out how to set up a development env.
