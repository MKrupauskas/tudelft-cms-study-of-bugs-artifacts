A saltmaster server stop working because disk became full, more than 3 GB on `/var/cache/salt/master/jobs`

I changed:

```
 keep_jobs: 1
```

But disk continues to increase, some how there is no an autopurge feature, or it is not working properly.

Any idea of how to prevent this within salt, instead of using an external cron to clean files older than 1hour for example?
