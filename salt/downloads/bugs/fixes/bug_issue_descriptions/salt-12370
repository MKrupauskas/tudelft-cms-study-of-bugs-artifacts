I don't think this is safe to do this on the threaded (windows) minion:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/cae9fd7f81c6030000508f711709695abde55f3b/salt/state.py#L616

I suspect this is the root cause of #12064 & #10773 & #11235. I often get `global name '__salt__' is not defined` for a managed .py file. A managed .py file triggers a module refresh. I'm running 2014.0.1, patched with the latest `modules/win_file.py`.
