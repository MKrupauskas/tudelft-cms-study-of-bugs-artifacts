We've got various local repo's defined in /etc/yum.repos.d - some of these had gpgcheck enabled as a local config setting.

Attempting to install unsigned packages from these custom repos failed whether skip_verify was True or not.

looking at the code (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L235), I'm guessing its setting the global yum config variable (i.e. /etc/yum.conf), which I'm double guessing is then being overridden by specific repo config. i.e.  /etc/yum.repos.d/my-repo.repo also sets gpgcheck=1. 

Removing the gpgcheck=1 from the custom repo definition resolved the issue

Not sure if it's worth the coding to handle individual repo definitions, if not, probably worth documenting somewhere/somehow and pointing out that skip_verify only impacts the global setting.

Cheers
