**Description**
A `NOTICE` file has been included with this [commit](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/1dd0e342b5af2501e761a4067e0ceab02f7a6616). As it stands, the text is misleading:

```
Apache SaltStack
Copyright 2014-2019 The Apache Software Foundation

This product includes software developed at
The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).
```

As it stands, the text is misleading as it attributes SaltStack's copyright to The Apache Software Foundation and calls the software `Apache SaltStack` - I check the ASF web pages and there's no sight of Salt being an Apache project.

Also, NOTICE file isn't at all necessary, unless you are an official ASF project (source https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html):

```
Does this policy apply to projects outside the ASF that use the Apache License?

No. This is strictly an ASF policy. Other projects using the Apache License should still refer to the license's appendix for guidance on applying a header to their source files.
