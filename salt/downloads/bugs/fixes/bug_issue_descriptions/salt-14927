If you're syncing a replacement for the event execution module down to minions via the `_modules` dir (say you've back-ported a newer version of the module), and that module contains errors you see a traceback in the return for `sync_all`. Not a huge deal and you can kind of guess at the culprit but if you don't know Salt fires an event during the sync process it might be confusing. I think we could wrap this with a human-friendly error.

```
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/minion.py", line 793, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 331, in sync_all
        refresh_modules()
      File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 358, in refresh_modules
        __salt__['event.fire']({}, 'module_refresh')
    KeyError: 'event.fire'
```
