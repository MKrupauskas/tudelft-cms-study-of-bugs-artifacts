The relevant formula is pretty simple

``` yaml
mariadb-server:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: MariaDB 10.0 stable repository
    - name: deb http://mirror2.hs-esslingen.de/mariadb/repo/10.0/ubuntu trusty main
    - dist: trusty
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list
    - keyid: 1BB943DB
    - keyserver: keyserver.ubuntu.com
    - require_in:
      - pkg: mariadb-server

  pkg.installed:
    - name: mariadb-server
    - require:
      - pkgrepo: mariadb-server
```

Installing the package manually or with the following formula works

``` yaml
cmd.run:
  - name: "apt-get -q -y -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confold -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef install mariadb-server"
  - env:
    - 'DEBIAN_FRONTEND': 'noninteractive'
  - require:
    - pkgrepo: mariadb-repo
```

The problem can be worked around by setting the cmd.run state as a dependency of the pkg.installed state, making it a noop.
