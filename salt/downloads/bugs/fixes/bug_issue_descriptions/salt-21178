If you run `salt-run` without any module.function parameters, the following exception occurs:

```
# salt-run
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError:

```

If you add the module.function parameter to the command, such as `salt-run manage.down` but the master is not running, the following stack trace occurs:

```
# salt-run manage.down
[ERROR   ] Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased.
Exception occurred in runner manage.down: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/client/mixins.py", line 314, in low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/runners/manage.py", line 113, in down
    ret = status(output=False).get('down', [])
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/runners/manage.py", line 42, in status
    minions = client.cmd('*', 'test.ping', timeout=__opts__['timeout'])
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/client/__init__.py", line 517, in cmd
    **kwargs)

    'Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this '
EauthAuthenticationError: Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

However, if the salt-master is running, you still get the first stacktrace in the exact same manner, but the second one goes away and the correct output prints:

```
# salt-run manage.down
- nt-master
- nt-test-linode
```

@ssgward I didn't see an issue filed yet for this when we talked about it the other day as I think we were thinking #20597 was a duplicate (however it is a different issue). Please feel free to close this one if this has already been filed.

@cro I'm not sure if this has been discussed or not, but I wanted to be sure you knew about this one. Feel free to change the severity if deemed necessary.
