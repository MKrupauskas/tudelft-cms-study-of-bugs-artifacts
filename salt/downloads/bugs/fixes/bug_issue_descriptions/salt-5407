I can't seem to reload a service (while "service squid reload" works)

``` bash
# salt 'sproxy01a*' service.reload squid
sproxy01a.example.org:
    "service.reload" is not available.
```

``` bash
# salt 'sproxy01a*' grains.get os
sproxy01a.example.org:
    RedHat
```

``` bash
# salt 'sproxy01a*' grains.get osrelease
sproxy01a.example.org:
    6.3
```

Also I have the following state : 

``` bash
squid:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - name: {{ pillar['convention-os']['pkg']['squid'] }}

  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
    - reload: True
    - name: {{ pillar['convention-os']['service']['squid'] }}
    - watch:
       - pkg: squid
       - file: {{ pillar['convention-os']['directory']['squid'] }}/squid.conf
       - file: {{ pillar['convention-os']['directory']['squid'] }}/ACL/not_cached.conf
```

As a result, Squid restarts when I make a change in squid.conf, instead of reloading. The whole Squid cluster is down for about a minute.

To my knowledge, this affects RHEL 5.x and RHEL 6.x.

Another user faces the problem on SuSE :
