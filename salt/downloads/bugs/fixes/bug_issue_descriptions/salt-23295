A pillar entry like this:

```
databases:
  "" : 'master/production'
  "FOO" : 'foo/production'
  "BAR" : 'bar/production'
```

used to include the entry with the empty-string key, so it would come out in e.g. `pillar['databases'].iteritems()`. It started omitting that entry somewhere between Salt 2014.7.2 and 2014.7.5 â€” that's the upgrade I did a couple of days ago, causing me to notice this.

(In salt state files I'm using these entries into a format string making a multi-database configuration for an application, hence the empty-string key.)

Empty keys are valid in YAML, and not mentioned as unsupported in pillar documentation, and there is nothing in the release notes about this. So this is probably a side effect of some other change.
