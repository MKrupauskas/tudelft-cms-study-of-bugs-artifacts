In our environment we are attempting to use a hierarchy of salt-masters that are syndicated across multiple levels.
When we connect to the machine that is running the master that is at the top of the hierarchy and run

``` yaml
salt '*' test.ping

dtc-master-chi:
    True
dtc-master-aus:
    True
flt-master:
    True
pod-master-chi-unos:
    True
pod-master-aus-sxsw:
    True
pod-master-aus-sema:
    True
pod-minion-chi-unos-admin:
    True
pod-minion-chi-unos-crm:
    True
pod-minion-chi-unos-bi:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sxsw-admin:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sxsw-bi:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sema-crm:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sema-admin:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sema-bi:
    True
pod-minion-aus-sxsw-crm:
    True
```

as the root user we get the test.ping call passed all the way down through the syndication hierarchy with no problem.

We are trying to leverage the security capabilities of Salt and so we created a "saltdev" user for testing purposes and
also configured external auth on each of the masters to match..

``` yaml
external_auth:
  pam:
    saltdev:
      - .*
```

What is odd is that when we run the command as the authenticated user saltdev

``` yaml
salt -a pam --username=saltdev --password=saltdev '*' test.ping

flt-master:
    True
dtc-master-chi:
    True
dtc-master-aus:
    True
```

The request only executes on the direct minions and is not propagated to the syndics.

We do see

```
2015-05-19 18:50:15,383 [salt.master      ][WARNING ][61]  Authentication failure of type "user" occurred
```

offending line in master.py seems to be 

``` python
    elif clear_load.pop('key') != self.key[self.opts.get('user', 'root')]:                     log.warning(                         'Authentication failure of type "user" occurred.'                     )

```
