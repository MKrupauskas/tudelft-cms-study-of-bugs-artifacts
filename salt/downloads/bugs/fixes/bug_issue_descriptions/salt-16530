In earlier versions of Salt the default behavior of pillars was for one dict to overwrite another. Now the default behavior is to recursively merge the dicts together. I was just caught off-guard by this. If you're setting up defaults in a generic pillar, then overwriting them in specific pillars, then the generic defaults will be merged in with the specific which is not what's expected. Overwrite isn't even an option anymore... 

This just nearly caused an outage for me when testing a new service. Can overwrite please be added to the list and have it be the default, so it's backwards compatible? This is a pretty critical regression.
