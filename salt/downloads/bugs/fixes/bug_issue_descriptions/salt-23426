The way salt restarts the salt-minion on windows is to create a scheduled task to restart the service and then launch the scheduled task.
For some reason this is no longer working on 64bit windows starting with 2015.2. The scheduled task never gets created. Here's the command:

```
salt 'test64' service.restart salt-minion
```

It returns:

```
ERROR: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

When you look at the scheduled tasks for the machine, it is not there.
The command that creates the scheduled task is as follows:

```
schtasks /RU "System" /Create /TN restart-salt-minion /TR "powershell Restart-Service salt-minion" /sc ONCE /sd 01/15/1975 /st 01:00 /F'
```

If I run this from the master using cmd.run, the task is completed successfully, which is basically what the python code does.
This just started happening on the 2015 branch. Still works properly in 2014.7 branch.
