### Description of Issue/Question
On subsequent runs, my containers get replaced, due to detected change of oom_kill_disable param:

```
Function: docker_container.running
        Name: mycontainer
      Result: True
     Comment: Replaced container 'mycontainer'

This might be specific to my setup, as I'm running saltstack in a vagrant-debian8 machine on Win10.
Setting oom-kill-disable explicitly results in docker discarding the option, as the kernel does not support it:

```
$ docker run --oom-kill-disable mycontainer
WARNING: Disabling the OOM killer on containers without setting a '-m/--memory' limit may be dangerous.
WARNING: Your kernel does not support OomKillDisable. OomKillDisable discarded.

$ docker inspect mycontainer
  ...
  "HostConfig": {  
  ...   
            "OomKillDisable": null,
  ...
  },
  ...
```
### Setup
init.sls:
```
mycontainer:
  docker_container.running:
    - image: myimage
```

Note: I also tried to uninstall docker-py and install docker instead, as recommended in but this resulted in:
```
    Comment: State 'docker_image.present' was not found in SLS 'mycontainer'
              Reason: 'docker_image' __virtual__ returned False: 'docker.version' is not available.
```
