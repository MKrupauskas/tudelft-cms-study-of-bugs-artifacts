We use the salt message bus to do some event driven infrastructure. One example is pushing an event to the master every time we push a changeset to our mercurial server. 

This is in a mercurial hook which is not asynchronous. So it is important to keep the time it takes to execute low. 

Our first approach was to do the following :  

```
sudo salt-call --local --skip-grains --log-level quiet event.send hg$PWD
```

This worked rather well. (Looking back, the "--local" was a bit weird but since the message did get to the master with that we took it for "skip getting info from the master, shoot and forget"). Now we've upgraded to 2015.8 and it is way too long (feels like a freeze for the end user).
