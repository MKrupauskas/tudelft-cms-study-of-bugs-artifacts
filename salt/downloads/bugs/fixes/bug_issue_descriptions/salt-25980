I'm trying to run a salt-master / salt-minion setup on a single machine (freebsd 9) using ipv6. This is continuously failing with "Invalid argument". 

Master config file: http://paste2.org/ZhFypIas
Minion config file: http://paste2.org/mwmB30kK

Master log level all: http://paste2.org/jwmBBssM
Minion log level all: http://paste2.org/bbm59AYy

We've hit this on freebsd infrastructure. I've created a clean freebsd-9 VM just to test this, and hit it as well. Let me know if any info is needed
