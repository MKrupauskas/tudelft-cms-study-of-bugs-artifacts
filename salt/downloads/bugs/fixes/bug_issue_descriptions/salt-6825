When attempting to extend a state specified in another sls, I get the following error in the minion log:

```
2013-08-21 15:09:04,876 [salt.minion                                 ][WARNING ] The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):

```

I believe this is new behavior just in the past couple of days. I am running this morning's develop branch. Here is the yaml that triggers the error:

```
extend:
  nginx:
    service:
      - watch:
        - file: /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf
      - require:
        - file: /etc/nginx/conf.d/proxy.conf
```

Here is the output of `salt --versions-report`:
