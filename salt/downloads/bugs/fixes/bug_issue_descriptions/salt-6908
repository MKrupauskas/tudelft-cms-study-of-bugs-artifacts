If a new unauthenticated minion starts up, it will ping the masters in serial to auth, like:

```
Starting the salt minion
Waiting for key to be accepted on master-1...
```

So I have to accept the key on `master-1` before I can on `master-2`, if for whatever reason I can not access `master-1` then I can't accept the minion on `master-2`. As am I using EC2 for auto starting the minions with a `cloud-init` script, I don't have access to the minion at this point to edit the `minion.conf` to remove the `master-1` and also I think needing to do that would be somewhat annoying. 

I really have `master-1` as redundancy so don't use it on a day to day basis, so would be good if `salt-minion` were able to continue just fine with only one master accepting the key.

Might be worth mentioning: the first master it tried to auth with was actually the _second_ in masters link in my `minion.conf`
