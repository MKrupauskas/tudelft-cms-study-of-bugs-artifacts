```
$ sudo salt "minion-name" cmd.run "echo \"foo\"; bar=\"baz\"; echo \$bar"
minion-name:
    foo
    baz
$ sudo salt "minion-name" cmd.run "bar=\"baz\"; echo \$bar"
minion-name:
    TypeError encountered executing cmd.run: run() takes at least 1 argument (0 given). See debug log for more info.
```

Not being able to lead a cmd.run string of commands with a variable assignment is odd, and should probably be documented or properly escaped such that it will work.

This can be worked around by using the env option, sneaking in a no-op command ahead of the leading variable assignment (sleep 0), and things like that.  All the same, this is currently undocumented.
