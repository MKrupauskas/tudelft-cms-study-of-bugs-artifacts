After upgrading from 0.17 to v2014.1 my salt states are all broken. I'm using CentOS 6.5 and EPEL release.

If I have a sls that installs a package, and then drops in a /etc/yum.repos.d file to add a repository, and then tries to install a package from that repository, it fails with:

```
[ERROR   ] Package 'php-mcrypt' not found (possible matches: php-mcrypt). Package 'php-pecl-xdebug' not found (possible matches: php-pecl-xdebug). Package 'php-mysqlnd' not found (possible matches: php-mysqlnd). Package 'php-drush-drush' not found (possible matches: php-drush-drush).
```

If I remove the first package install, so it's just the repo file and then a package install. It works fine. It seems that on the first package install it CACHE the list of available packages - but since the repo file not created yet - it doesn't contain that repo's packages. Then on second package command it uses the CACHEd package list and ignored the fact I just dropped one in. Refresh: True does nothing to help.

Blame seems to be at in salt/states/pkg.py in check_db - it keeps the list in pkg._avail in context, but it doesn't appear to ever clear.

How can I resolve this without rewriting many many SLS files and without downgrading to 0.17 which worked perfectly?

If the Refresh: True can be made to work that would be best.
