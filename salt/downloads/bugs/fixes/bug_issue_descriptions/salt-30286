With `salt-cloud` and the `ec2` driver use of `userdata_file` results in an error with attempts to use spot instance requests.

It appears the use of `UserData` is not specified w/ `spot_prefix` parameter in [`ec2.py`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py#L1620)

replacing:
`params['UserData'] = base64.b64encode(userdata)` 

with:
`params[spot_prefix + 'UserData'] = base64.b64encode(userdata)`

resolved the issue on my install.  A PR will be coming unless someone beats me to it...
