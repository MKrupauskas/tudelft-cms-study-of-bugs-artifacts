Since 2015.8.4 aws signature generation on AWS instances using instance profile credentials seems broken on Python 2.6 (e.g. Centos/RHEL 6)

```
salt-call --local s3.get xxxxx path=yyyy local_file=/tmp/yyyy location=ap-southeast-2

  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/utils/aws.py", line 156, in assumed_creds
    now = (datetime.utcnow() - datetime(1970, 1, 1)).total_seconds()
AttributeError: 'datetime.timedelta' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'
```

since total_seconds was only introduced in Python 2.7
https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta.total_seconds
The relevant code is
