I'm using salt version 2014.7.5 (latest stable version at this time, don't know if this issue is the same in 2015.2 branch).

My use case is that I want to use `salt-ssh` to force salt-minion installation and configuration from static packages. That's in order to control the salt update process better. I don't know if there is a better way to do it.

So, with the state `salt.minion`:

```
salt-minion:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - salt:        salt://pkg/salt/salt-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm
      - salt-minion: salt://pkg/salt/salt-minion-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm
```

Launched with:

```
salt-ssh -i 'minion1' state.sls salt.minion
```

The states fails, and I can see that the rpm files are not included in the generated `salt_state.tgz` file:

```
minion1:
----------
          ID: salt-minion
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: salt-minion, salt.
     Started: 15:16:20.836561

     Changes:   

Summary
------------

Failed:    1
------------
Total states run:     1
```

If I change the state as this:

```
/tmp/salt.rpm:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://pkg/salt/salt-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm
/tmp/salt-minion.rpm:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://pkg/salt/salt-minion-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm

salt-minion:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - salt:        salt://pkg/salt/salt-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm
      - salt-minion: salt://pkg/salt/salt-minion-2014.7.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm
```

The state succeeds, as the rpm files are included in the tarball file:

```
