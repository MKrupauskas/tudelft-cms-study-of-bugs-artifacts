For examle `eselect java-vm list`:

```
    Available Java Virtual Machines:
      [1]   oracle-jre-bin-1.7 
      [2]   oracle-jre-bin-1.8  system-vm
```

To set `oracle-jre-bin-1.7` I need to run `eselect java-vm system oracle-jre-bin-1.8`.  But there is no way to do it with current version of salt.
