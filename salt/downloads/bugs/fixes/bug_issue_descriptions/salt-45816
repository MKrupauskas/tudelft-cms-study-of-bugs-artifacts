### Description of Issue/Question

When running modules.boto3_route53.change_resource_record_sets the code gets stuck in an infinite loop when the API refuses to do the work, but doesn't return a rate limiting code which might trigger a retry.

An example is say attempting to change a pre-existing record which is a CNAME to an A, which the API doesn't allow for 

I've raised https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/45815 to fix it
