### Description of Issue/Question
After updating to the Fluorine and switching to python36 I run on the problem with `salt-call`. Any execution of the `salt-call` with any module leads to the this stackstrace:
https://gist.github.com/Oloremo/8c1d9da8a66342f0eb2354442825d9ce

Simplest example is somethinf like `cmd.run ls`

I pinpoint this problem to a single minion option - `minion_pillar_cache: True`. Setting it to False solves the issue. 



### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I have a very customized Salt deployment, it's a Centos 7 with python36 from EPEL and salt is installed via pip and runs from non-root user so I'm not sure if it's reproducible on a normal deployment.

But I was able to reproduce it using a docker to mimic mine deployment. So if you like or if you can't reproduce it on your env, you could download docker project from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b5j5qp55e0c622j/salt-bug.tar.gz?dl=0
unpack it in some dir and follow 3 steps instruction(included in README file):
```
1) cd into root of this directory
2) docker build -t salt-bug .
3) docker run -it salt-bug bash /start-daemons.sh
```
