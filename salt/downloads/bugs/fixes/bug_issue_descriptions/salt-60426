Usage like this should work, however we generate an "Orphaned accumulator" error in the file.accumulated state when the requisite does not use the "function: state_id" reference style.
```
configuration file:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/foo/bar
    - source: salt://files/foo_bar.jinja
    - template: jinja

accumulated configstuff:
  file.accumulated:
    - filename: /etc/foo/bar
    - text:
      - some
      - good
      - stuff
    - watch_in:
      - configuration file
```

Also this error check does not appear to protect against cases where there are multiple requisites of the watch_in or require_in flavors and the file state which utilizes the accumulator does not use the old {'function': 'state_id'} requisite reference style.

Why is this fatal? This error prevents writing and testing file.accumulate states prior to the states which utilize the accumulator. Can we be more lenient here?

I think this error check should be removed if we can't really check and validate the requisite properly. Can it be demoted to a warning by diverting the error message to comments, but not fail the file.accumulated state?
