### Description of Issue/Question

" **virtual** returned False" is not a clear error message.  A person needs to guess  the reason for the issue.  e.g. missing OS Package for example.
### Setup

```
salt-call -l debug ps.get_pid_list
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad ps.get_pid_list
'ps' __virtual__ returned False
```

If debug level message can indicate the issue then can't it be passed on. Or change the error level higher than DEBUG

Maybe each module needs to come with a meta data file, which list any requirements per OS Family (default) and Specific OS.  So you can then run salt command to find out what is missing and what it is used for.  ????
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

rpm -qi python2-psutil
package python2-psutil is not installed
