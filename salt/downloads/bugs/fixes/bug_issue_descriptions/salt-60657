```

in the past i think it was version (2017.7.4) a pillar like

pillar.sls
```
include:
    - a1
    - a2
    - a1
```
a1.sls
```
__test: {{sls}}
```
a2.sls
```
__test: {{sls}}
```

would have `__test=a2` because it skips the last include since it was already included.

The new behavior is not "bad" but is unexpected and caused some of my systems to get different pillars values than previous version.

I have pillars systems setup like...

base.sls
```
stuff: x
msg: z
```

auth-base.sls
```
include:
 - base
stuff: y
msg: dont_ever
```

auth-domain.sls
```
include:
 - base
stuff: z
```

cpu123.sls
```
include:
 - auth-base
 - auth-domain
```

I expected cpu123 piller `msg: dont_ever` but because auth-domain also includes base I think that's why I see `msg: z`.

Again I was not able to revert to the previous version to confirm these findings.
