Running Salt-Minion-2014.7.0-AMD64-Setup.exe from a subdirectory of the D: drive on my Windows 2012 server resulted in over 20 files related to the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package  being created at the root of the D: drive (including 9 eula text files, install.exe, install.ini, install.res.*.dll files, VC_RED.cab, VC_RED.MSI, and the vcredist.bmp).  Not good.
