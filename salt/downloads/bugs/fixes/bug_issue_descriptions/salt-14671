My team can add two repository sources to the config file as follows: 

```
ext_pillar:
    - git: master git://gitserver/git-pillar.git 
    - git: master git://gitserver/git-pillar-private.git
```

The problem is we only see one of the repositories.
I believe this is an error in the logic of the code:  
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/pillar/git_pillar.py#L224

It's placing the repos by branch, which is a unique key,  So two different repos in the same environment are impossible. 

I've tried soliciting input in the IRC channel and searched tickets.
