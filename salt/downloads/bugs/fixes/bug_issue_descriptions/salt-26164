The VMware cloud driver fails to create a VM if `image` is not specified under the profile. Here's the error:

```
[ERROR   ] The required 'image,provider' configuration setting is missing from the 'vmware-oel6.6' profile, which is configured under the 'vcenter01' alias.
[ERROR   ] The required 'image,provider' configuration setting is missing from the 'vmware-oel6.6' profile, which is configured under the 'vcenter01' alias.
```

The driver does not require the `image` argument to be specified currently as it does cloning using `clonefrom` argument. The `image` argument may be added sometime in future and in that case it will be optional to either specify `image` or specify `cloneform` argument.
