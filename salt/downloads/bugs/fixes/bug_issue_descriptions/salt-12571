I'm trying to search for a pattern in the file present on the minion. If the pattern is found, i want salt to replace it with the text i give as replacement. If not found then it should append it to the file. If the file doesn't exist, it should create a new file and append replacement text to it. 

I'm able to make salt replace the pattern with the text i give as replacement. I set  `append_if_not_found: True` but it still doesn't append the replacement text to the file and neither does it create the file and append the replacement text in case the file doesn't exist. 

I want you to look into it and see if `append_if_not_found` actually works. 

Here's my declaration:

```
auto-direct:
  file.replace:
    - name: /etc/auto.direct
    - pattern: {{ pillar['nfs']['localMountLocation'] }}.*
    - repl: "{{ pillar['nfs']['localMountLocation'] }}      {{ pillar['nfs']['mountOption'] }}      {{ pillar['nfs']['serverAlias'] }}:{{ pillar['nfs']['remoteMountLocation'] }}"
    - count: 1
    - append_if_not_found: True
    - backup: '.bak'
```

Here's the pillar data:

```
nfs:
  localMountLocation: /mnt/nfs/home
  serverAlias: server.domain.com
  remoteMountLocation: /backups/nfstest
  mountOption: -fstype=nfs4,rw,nosuid,bg,intr,timeo=3000,retrans=120
```

Here's how the file in which the edits have to be made looks like if it exists:

```
/mnt/nfs1/home      -fstype=nfs4,rw,nosuid,bg,intr,timeo=3000,retrans=120      server.domain.com:/backups/nfstest
```
