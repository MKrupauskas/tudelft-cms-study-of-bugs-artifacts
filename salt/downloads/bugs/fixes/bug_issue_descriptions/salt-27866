Sending a test.ping to a Windows minion seems to take on average nearly 6 seconds, compared to less than 1 seconds for a Linux minion.

This is not caused by underlying network latency as far as I can tell, since I've tested when the master and minions are on the same subnet and on different ones.

It seems to be a problem that is new in minion version 2015.8. Rolling back a minion to 2015.5.x removed the problem.

It seems to be specific to the minion version, rather than the master version (tests with 2015.8 and 2015.5.3 masters both showed the problem, as long as the minion was on 2015.8).
