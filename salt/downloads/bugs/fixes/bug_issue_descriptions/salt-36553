### Description of Issue/Question

Despite seeing errors from the `hg` command (which were my fault), the formatted salt report thing says that the state `hg.latest` succeeded.
### Setup

```
# mercurial.sls
mercurial:
  hg.latest:
    - name: ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/nickwilliams/influx-salt
    - rev: tip
    - target: /srv
    - identity: /root/deploy_rsa
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

In this example I've accidentally left an untracked file `salt/mercurial.sls` lying around in the checkout, which (correctly) fails the `hg update` with errors, however as you see the salt report claims it succeeded.

```
(ve-salt) vagrant@precise64:~$ sudo salt-call --local state.apply
[ERROR   ] Command '['hg', 'update', 'tip']' failed with return code: 255
[ERROR   ] output: abort: untracked file in working directory differs from file in requested revision: 'salt/mercurial.sls'

### Versions Report

I'm running salt at [this previous PR](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/36546) re: states.hg, but I did check the same thing happens with the latest release via salt-bootstrap.sh too (`2016.3.3`).
