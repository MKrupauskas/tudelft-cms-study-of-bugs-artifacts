I tried running sync_modules to get rid of an old module that I had used to override a salt module using the same name. The saltutil.sync_modules command happily syncs changes in existing files and new files, however it does not delete files that should not be there.

In my opinion, either the documentation should mention this, since a sync would mean to bring the directory exactly in line with what the salt fileserver has in that directory, or preferrably the sync operation should actually delete old/missing files.
