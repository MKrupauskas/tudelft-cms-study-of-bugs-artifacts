If an sls has a pkg install as well as a module state that requires the package being installed, it will fail with a key error.

Workarounds appear to be to have a primary sls that includes 2 sls files. The first with the pkg installs and the second with the module states that depended on the pkg installs.

Example is installing mysql and using the mysql_database module. The modules can't load until their virtual definition meets it's requirements (usually a command that the pkg installs). While the pkg state should reload modules, it appears we hit an error in initial processing instead of letting each state run prior to key checks of future states.

This was hard to search on, so hopefully not a duplicate. We have a lot of documentation that uses pkg.installed followed by a configuration module. Require is not enough to stop the key error.
