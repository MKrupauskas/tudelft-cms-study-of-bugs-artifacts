### Description of Issue/Question

When i start a docker with the following config it works. But only the first run. The second run fails.

```
squid-docker:
  dockerng.running:
    - name: squid
    - image: {{ squid.image }}
    - user: squid
    - port_bindings:
      - '3128:3128'
    - restart_policy: always
```

This is because the baseimage `centos:7` contains labels. When i add the following config to the SLS file

```
squid-docker:
  dockerng.running:
    - name: squid
    - image: {{ squid.image }}
    - user: squid
    - labels:
      - build-date: '2016-03-04'
      - license: 'GPLv2'
      - name: 'CentOS Base Image'
      - vendor: 'CentOS'
    - port_bindings:
      - '3128:3128'
    - restart_policy: always
```

It works. So i think the defaults must be ignored.
