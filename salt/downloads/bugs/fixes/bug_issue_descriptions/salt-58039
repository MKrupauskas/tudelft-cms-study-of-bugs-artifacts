**Description**
It appears version matching considers the release as part of version, and fails to match the specified version in the state

Relevant log:
```

```


**Setup**

```
# rpm -q kibana
kibana-6.5.4-1.x86_64
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

1. Run following state, with kibana package already installed.
```yaml
kibana:
  pkg.installed:
    - version: 6.5.4
```
2. We get the fallowing result when we run with `test=true`:

```yaml
----------
          ID: kibana
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: None
     Comment: The following packages would be installed/updated: kibana=6.5.4
     Started: 12:55:29.215411
    Duration: 474.698 ms
     Changes:

Summary for local
```

If ran without test, it fails:

```yaml
----------
          ID: kibana
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: kibana=6.5.4
     Started: 13:03:17.561401
    Duration: 32915.894 ms
     Changes:
----------
```

**Expected behavior**
Report that the package is already installed
