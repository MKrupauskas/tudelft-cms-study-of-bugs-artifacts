salt.cloud emits ambiguous errors when salt.states.cloud.\* needs a function that has not been implemented in the cloud driver. The salt/cloud/**init**.py has a lot of if blocks all over the place checking for driver implementation of any particular function. Each has different error messages, few explaining what actually went wrong.

```
[ERROR   ] Creating 'name' using 'your_ec2_provider:ec2' as the provider cannot complete since 'ec2' is not available
```

This makes the impression that the cloud provider is not available, which is not the case since these errors can occur after many successful API calls to fun that have been properly implemented (if you want to `--log-level=trace` to see that). 
### Setup

Create an EC2 account, salt cloud provider, a EC2 VM set up for masterless state run.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try salt.states.cloud.volume_attached state on the VM. Use `salt-call --loglevel=debug` to get the relevant error messages

observe:

```
[DEBUG   ] Using AWS endpoint: your.ec2.endpoint
[DEBUG   ] AWS Request: https://your.ec2.endpoint/?Action=DescribeInstances&Version=2014-10-01
[DEBUG   ] AWS Response Status Code: 200
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad ec2.volume_list
[ERROR   ] Creating 'name' using 'your_ec2_provider:ec2' as the provider cannot complete since 'ec2' is not available
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output
```

What does this mean? It means that the ec2 salt cloud driver does not implement it. I wish other people could have a better time debugging this than I did.
