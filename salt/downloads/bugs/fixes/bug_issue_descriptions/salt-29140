Hi guys,

I am running this state on my test box trying to un-mount all the mounts for one device, then right after that, mount the device on the right mount point.

version of salt:
salt-call 2015.8.1 (Beryllium)

this is how my state looks:

```
/mnt1:
  mount.unmounted:
    - name: /mnt1
    - device: /dev/xvdb
    - persist: True

/mnt3:
  mount.unmounted:
    - name: /mnt3
    - device: /dev/xvdb
    - persist: True

/mnt2:
  mount.unmounted:
    - name: /mnt2
    - device: /dev/xvdb
    - persist: True

/var/lib/cassandra:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: /dev/xvdb
    - fstype: ext3
    - mkmnt: True
    - opts: nobootwait,noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier
    - dump: 0
    - pass_num: 2
    - persist: True
    - require:
      - mount: /mnt1
      - mount: /mnt3
      - mount: /mnt2
  file.directory:
    - name: /var/lib/cassandra
    - user: cassandra
    - group: cassandra
    - mode: 755
    - makedirs: True
```

after running: sudo salt-call --local state.sls test -l debug

i can see salt unmounted some mountpoints, not all of them, plues the result looks like it is not correct as /mnt1 is still mounted.

```
local:

          ID: /mnt1
    Function: mount.unmounted
      Result: True

              ----------
              mount:
                  True
```

```
/dev/xvdb on /mnt1 type ext3 (rw)
/dev/xvdb on /var/lib/cassandra type ext3 (rw,noatime,nodiratime,nobarrier,_netdev)
```

looking at the debug i can see salt is running umount [device] but not specifying the mountpoint

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'umount /dev/xvdb' in directory '/home/dfernandez'
[INFO    ] {'umount': True}
```

I tried to remove device from the state to see if salt would unmount the drive by its mount point, but looks like it is needed by the function.

just to try i modified the function mount.umounted adding None as a default value for devices, so i can force salt to use names and see if that would solve the problem.

```
def unmounted(name,
              device=None,
              config='/etc/fstab',
```

looks like that did the trick:

```

          ID: /mnt1
    Function: mount.unmounted

```

is this something you could fix guys? , please also let me know if this is not a good idea, I know that having several mounts mounting the same volume doesn't make  much sense but still.

thanks!
