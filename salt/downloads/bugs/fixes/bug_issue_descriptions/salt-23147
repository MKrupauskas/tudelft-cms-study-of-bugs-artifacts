I am trying to use the Cassandra CQL returner with the master_job_cache and getting the following error:

```

My master config has the following:

```
cassandra:
  cluster:
    10.111.110.11
    10.111.110.12
    10.111.110.13
    10.111.110.14
    10.111.110.15
    10.111.110.16
  port:
    9042
  username:
  password:

master_job_cache: cassandra
```

When I comment out the master_job_cache everything returns to normal.  I have the Cassandra driver from Datastax properly configured and tested as well.
