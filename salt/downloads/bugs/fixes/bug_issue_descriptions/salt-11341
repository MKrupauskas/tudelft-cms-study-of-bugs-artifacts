I've discovered an issue with installers on 64 bit Windows.

So I've noticed with regedit if the installer uses this path it works:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

But if it uses this path it doesn't:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall

Depending on how you're accessing the registry through python it might return the first path on 64 bit windows instead of the second path. I would expect this if you're running 32 bit python. You should probably check both paths.
