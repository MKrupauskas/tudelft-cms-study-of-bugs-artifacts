When I change the static pillar file (and call `refresh_pillar`) the change propagates well to `pillar.data`. But not in `pillar.get`.

The implemtation of `pillar.get` is different, since it relies on buildin (!) `__pillar__` dict and does not try to regenerate the pillar itself (as other `pillar.*` functions). Fixing this would be an easy pick, but the fact the change does not propagate to `__pillar__` dictionary in pillar module whould suggest, that it does not propagate well enought to all other modules that are relying on `__pillar__` data. 

PS: Ofcourse `sync_all` or any other call does not help. One must restart the minion, to propage the pillar changes into pillar.get
