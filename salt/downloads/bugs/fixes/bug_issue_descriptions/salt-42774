### Description of Issue/Question
The following works on 2016.11, but is broken on 2017.7
I suspect this is a result of the wildcards change, but I'm not sure if it is intended.

Works if I specify the full version, or the version with `*`

### Setup
Have the following state:
```salt
htop:
  pkg.installed:
    - version: 2.0.2
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running `salt-call state.sls htop` will install the package, but fail to recognize the package is installed and fail.

Debug log has the following line:

`[DEBUG   ] Current version (['2.0.2-1.el7']) did not match desired version specification (2.0.2), adding to installation targets`
