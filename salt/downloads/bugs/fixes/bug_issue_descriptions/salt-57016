So I'm a bit confused on the known issue for 2019.2.4. We are seeing highstate failures on several servers with the patch, changing _minion_runner to minion_runner in expose_methods seems to fix theses issues.

[ERROR   ] Requested method not exposed: minion_runner

It seems like this is a know error that won't be fixed till June? This seems like a small fix to have that long of a timeline, is there more to this that I'm not seeing?
