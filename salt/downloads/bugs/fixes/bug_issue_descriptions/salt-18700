salt/utils/raetlane.py:122: [W0621(redefined-outer-name), _setup] Redefining name 'remote_yard' from outer scope (line 69)
```

Probably `remote_yard` was meant to be included in `_setup()`'s `global` declaration?
Also, `lane_remote_yard`, which is currently in the `global`, isn't actually used anywhere else in the function or file.
