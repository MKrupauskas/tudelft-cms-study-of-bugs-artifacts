### Description of Issue/Question

I've been noticing that a number of my minions will stop responding after being left alone for a while.  This did not start with a upgrade of Salt, a new state, or any other change I can attribute to it.  There does not appear to be any one action which causes the minions to stop responding, they just do.
### Setup

I have over 80 minions which are all identically configured (they are compute nodes in an HPC cluster).  If we begin at a starting point of all minions up and running, after a few days I begin to see this when running a state or doing anything else via Salt:

```
cn32:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn66:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn59:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn68:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

... with more and more minions having the problem the longer time goes on.  When I SSH to the system to investigate I sometimes, but not always, find a salt-minion process stuck at 100% CPU.  That is a major problem in my environment and is a more pressing matter than being unable to communicate with a minion.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Start a minion.
2. Wait.

Please let me know what more you need.  This is a major issue for me and at the moment SaltStack is unusable and is harming my systems (minion stuck at 100% == the scientific workloads of my machines can't work appropriately).
