When executing the `blkid` binary fails in `salt.modules.disk.blkid()`, the failure isn't handled properly and instead a backtrace is thrown:

```

The failure is more or less expected as this was executed in a `systemd-nspawn` container and I'll properly handle this case in my states, but in general the `disk` execution module should fail more gracefully.

**EDIT:**
The raw `blkid` output is zero - it just quits with returncode `2` and no output at all.
