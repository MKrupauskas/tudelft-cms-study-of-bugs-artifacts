Using version 2015.5.6 and this master configuration :

```
ext_pillar:
  - s3:
      bucket: mybucket
      keyid: mykeyid
      key: mykey
      location: eu-west-1
      s3_cache_expire: 30
      s3_sync_on_update: True
```

On a fresh master, I get an IO error :

```

```

In fact, the file does not exists, and the call to _getmtime_ will ever fail unless the file has been created externally.

I propose to fix this issue by testing the cache file creation before calling getmtime.
