Hi,
# Preamble:

Ubuntu 12.04.2
I have this stanza that this pertains to, in case this info is needed.

```
soe-packages:
  pkg.latest:
    - pkgs:
      - glusterfs-client
      - nscd
      - krb5-user
      - libpam-krb5
      - libnss-ldapd
      - debconf-utils
      - at
      - snmpd
      - openssh-server
      - denyhosts
      - mailutils
      - ssmtp
      - zsh
      - nethogs
      - iftop
      - sysstat
      - dctrl-tools
      - atop
      - acct
      - goaccess
      - net-tools
```
# Issue:

I have found that if a client/minion doesn't have the gpg key for a repository you get this somewhat cryptic error.

```
    State: - pkg
    Name:      soe-packages
    Function:  latest
        Result:    False
        Comment:   All targeted 12 packages failed to update. The following packages were already up-to-date: at, dctrl-tools, debconf-utils, mailutils, net-tools, openssh-server, snmpd, ssmtp, zsh
        Changes:  
```

After finding this issue, I removed iftop and removed the trusted.gpg file to reproduce this error for the below debug output.

```

[ERROR   ] Command '['apt-get', '-q', '-y', '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confold', '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef', 'install', 'iftop']' failed with return code: 100

# Solution?

So I think with A) a little better error message, ~~or/and B) offer an option to ignore authenticity of a repository/package.~~
_edit_: Just found skip_verify, d0H. So it's more just a error message that helps the admin identify the problem easily.

I hope this is useful.

Thanks for the great software.
