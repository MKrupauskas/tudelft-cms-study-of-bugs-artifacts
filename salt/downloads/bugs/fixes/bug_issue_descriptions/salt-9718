During a deployment, we bump version from 3.2.5 to 3.3 and we get weird git error:

```
State: - git
Name:      git@github.com:**/**.git
Function:  latest
    Result:    False
    Comment:   cannot concatenate 'str' and 'float' objects
    Changes:  
```

I try to dig into the code and thinks I found the problem: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/7bb7ff8f2b2688dddb90d801965a8654c3a51776/salt/states/git.py#L216

I tried to add some log before this line and revision is parsed as a float. With this patch, state.highstate ends successfully:

If it's the problem and the patch works, I will push a pull-request.
