The salt.utils.smb module has a dependency on impacket. There is code for catching when the module impacket fails to load and HAS_IMPACKET is set accordingly however there is no __virtual__ function that verifies it so the module always loads.

This for example makes bootstrapping a windows minion fail with a error and traceback about the global name 'impacket' not being defined.

A workaround is of course to install the impacket library. Is the behaviour maybe by design?
