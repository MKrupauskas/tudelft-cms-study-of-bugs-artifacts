### Description of Issue/Question

Using `min_docker_py` in [modules/dockerng.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/dockerng.py#L356-L358) causes a stack trace such as this:

```
 Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1703, in call
              **cdata['kwargs'])
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1660, in wrapper
              return f(*args, **kwargs)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/dockerng.py", line 1615, in running
              validate_ip_addrs=validate_ip_addrs)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/dockerng.py", line 1776, in _validate_input
              cur_docker_py = _get_docker_py_versioninfo()
          NameError: global name '_get_docker_py_versioninfo' is not defined
```

Why this error occurs is actually explained by a comment a few lines above [in the same file](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/dockerng.py#L1753-1767)
### Setup

So far nothing except my PR #32886 uses `min_docker_py` (which seems a bit strange) so one would have to use that PR and try starting a docker container.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
