When using the `win_service` state execution module, I've noticed that the hostname is always set all in uppercase, e.g. `MYMINION` even if the provided hostname is `MyMinion` or `myminion`. It would be very useful if the hostname wasn't always set in all uppercase.

The Windows command `hostname` returns the hostname as-is, and not in all uppercase, and could perhaps be used instead of the current method:

```
C:\> hostname
MyMinion
```

Also, if Python were to be used to get the hostname, this also works fine:

```
import socket
socket.gethostname()
>> MyMinion
```

> @fredrikaverpil The function is in execution module win_system.py. It's right around line 344. (You may be looking in the state module.) It calls another function called get_system_info which returns a dictionary containing system info. The name element of the dictionary contains the Computer Name.
> get_system_infocalls the windows api function `NetServerGetInfo` which returns information about the system, including a capitalized computer name.
> So, the real issue here is the ability to get and set case sensitive computer names which would require a pretty big change in the way the win_service.py module works. Would you mind opening an issue on this?
