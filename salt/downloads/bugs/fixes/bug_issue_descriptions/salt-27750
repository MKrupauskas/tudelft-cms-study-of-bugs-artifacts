I opened https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/21910 a while back, and it looks like the fixes merged in that issue have been reverted(or just not carried over to a new file.)   The same error cropped back up, but this time I had to edit `transport/mixins/auth.py` and add `.strip()` in a few different spots where the public key was read.

In the case of the error above, the key on the minion did not have a newline at the end of the file, but the key on the master did so they did not match despite the actual key being correct.

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/21910 has more details, but I wasn't sure how to re-open a GH issue ;o.   Assuming there wasn't a specific reason for not using `.strip()`, would a patch similar to the one in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/21910 be accepted?
