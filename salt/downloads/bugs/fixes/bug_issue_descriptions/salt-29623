in `salt/salt/modules/htpasswd.py` having both the functions `useradd` and `useradd_all` makes no apparent sense to me.

Also, since those functions have the exact same documentation, it makes the documentation really unclear (see [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.htpasswd.html#salt.modules.htpasswd.userad)), because there are two functions which, at first glance, could do different things but don't.
