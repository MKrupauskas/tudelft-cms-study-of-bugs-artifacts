With the state(s):

```
{% for package in salt['pillar.get']('node_packages', []) %}
{{ package }}:
  npm:
    - installed
    - require:
      - pkg: npm
{% endfor %}
```

I get the following output:

```
State: - npm
Name:      less
Function:  installed
    Result:    False
    Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
