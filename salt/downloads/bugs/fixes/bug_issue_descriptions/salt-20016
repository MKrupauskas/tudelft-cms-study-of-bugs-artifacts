Heyo @ryan-lane - cheers for the assistance in IRC.

Getting an error in the minion: "Timed out waiting for Route53 status update." after 10 tries at getting the status.

Probably should just return success if the Route53 record create works.  Maybe have the timeout and number of tries as an option.
