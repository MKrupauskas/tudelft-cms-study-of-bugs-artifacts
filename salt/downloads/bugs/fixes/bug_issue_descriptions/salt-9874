I'm getting the following error when creating user accounts on SmartOS with Salt 0.17.4. Although the accounts get created successfully, this traceback is still getting generated. 

```

  TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'

Looking at the code here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v0.17.4/salt/modules/solaris_shadow.py

It appears that the uinfo = info(name) call at line 207 is failing. I think this is triggered by the code here at 118-121 in solaris_shadow.py:

```
   if len(fields) == 2:
        # For example:
        #   root      NL
        return
```

This return should return something, even if it is an empty dict. 

I think this issue is related to the fact that passwd on SmartOS can produce variable output. See this snippet from 'man passwd' on SmartOS

```
     The format of the display is:

       name status mm/dd/yy min max warn

     or, if password aging information is not present,

       name status
```

Basically, on a new account creation, there may not be password age information present, and thus len==2 and nothing gets returned.
