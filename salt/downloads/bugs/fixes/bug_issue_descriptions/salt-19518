Since the SSH port is hard coded to be 22 and the VM is accessed through the cloud service's DNS, creating another VM will result in a port conflict.
We can either:
- Add a command line option for the SSH port
- Get all the SSH ports that are used and choose one that is not

However, how will the master react to a non-22 SSH port when assigning a key?
