Hi, I am exploring salt to understand its capabilities in managing lxc containers, and have run into a number of issues using the latest salt from the develop repo. 

I have tried over 50 different combinations of salt commands using the salt lxc module, salt-run lxc, and salt-cloud, and looked at the documentation closely over the last 2 days, but there seems to be no clear way to successfully create a container, seed a container or bootstrap a container

The tests were carried out on fully functional LXC version 1.03 and 1.04 on Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 7 Wheezy, both physical hosts and KVM, and all failed. 

Some lxc module functions like 'lxc.list', 'lxc.info', 'lxc.destroy' work, and the generic cmd.run works without issue to target the lxc hosts and containers, but bootstrapping, cloning and creating just do not work. 

Below is a mix of errors on any command that tries to create, bootstrap or seed a container.

```
 keyerror config.gather bootstrap script error
 seeding error - failed to test password
```

In saltcloud with cloud profile and cloud provider defined as described in the docs, the command:

```
salt-cloud -p ubuntu-lxc cloudweb
```

 results in this error

```
failed to create VM cloudweb, configuration value 'cloudweb' needs to  be set, keyerror: 'cloudweb'
```

Is anyone else facing this? is anyone using salt lxc successfully, would really appreciate if you can share your configs. Would love to get this fixed.
