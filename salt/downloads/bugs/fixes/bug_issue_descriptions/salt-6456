This is an issue very similar to an issue first reported by Corey Quinn after upgrading to 10.2. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/jQxw9bA01V4

We recently (successfully I thought) from 13.1 to 15.3.

Below is my preliminary report on Google Groups.

My conclusion was that adding "-b 25%" brought this issue on and removing it from my highstates solved the issue....

File with strace, fd and jid info at:

On Thursday our master machine went "nuts". Out of memory. I found I have about 50 highstate process from the last couple of days all piled up. ('*' highstate runs from cron regularly).

This happened again this morning. I have rebooted the master machine but I am finding there is issue running hightstate from the master, but not remote execution and no issue with running a salt-call highstate on the client.

I have an strace, a file descriptor list and contents of jid files etc if needed.

Running the minion in debug mode it looks like a highstate ends fine with a final line:

[INFO    ] Returning information for job: 20130729125235965520

But on the master we are getting:

```
"Minion did not return"
```

I'll keep investigating. Not sure if I need to rush into upgrading to ver 16 or that might make the situation worse.

PS no I don't get a stack trace when CTRL-c on a running minion in the foreground.
