**Description**
Recently upgraded from 3000.9 to 3003.3. file.append doesn't care if the line is there anymore, it always add a new line at the end of the target file.

**Setup**
Please be as specific as possible and give set-up details.
- [x] VM (Ubuntu 18.04 VM)
- [x] VM running on a Azure

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
a simple setup in a .sls file:
/etc/fstab:
  file.append:
    - name: /etc/fstab
    - text: I am a new line that will forever append

**Expected behavior**
Based from the [documentation ](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html)and previous versions (3003.3 and below), file.append is supposed to check if the line exist before doing anything.

> Ensure that some text appears at the end of a file.
> The text will not be appended if it already exists in the file. A single string of text or a list of strings may be appended.

I currently have a farm of VM on 3000.9 which I confirmed is working as expected without duplicates even if I spam "salt xxxx state.apply", tested on 2 VM on 3003.3, both duplicate the entry on every single run.
