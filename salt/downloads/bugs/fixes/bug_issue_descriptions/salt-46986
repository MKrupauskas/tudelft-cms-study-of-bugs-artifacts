### Description of Issue/Question
Exactly as https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/46004, however the minimal reproduction scenario is slightly different.

### Setup
master config:
```
renderer: jinja | yaml | gpg
file_roots:
  base:
  - /srv/salt/states
pillar_roots:
  base:
  - /srv/salt/pillar/base
  test:
  - /srv/salt/pillar/test
  prod:
  - /srv/salt/pillar/prod
```

`/srv/salt/states/main.sls`:
```
include:
- one
- two
- three
```

`/srv/salt/states/one.sls`:
```
{%- set foo = salt['saltutil.runner']('pillar.show_pillar', minion='foo') %}
placeholder_one:
  test.succeed_without_changes
```

`/srv/salt/states/two.sls`:
```
placeholder_two:
  test.succeed_without_changes
```

`/srv/salt/states/three.sls`:
```
placeholder_three:
  test.succeed_without_changes
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
run `salt-run state.orchestrate main` and notice the error:
```
Specified SLS three in saltenv base is not available on the salt master or through a configured fileserver
```

I've tried to find the issue myself, but I'm stumped...tracing the contents of `__opts__['file_roots']` through the various files (`state.py`, `fileserver/roots.py`, `fileclient.py`, `renderers/jinja.py`, amongst others) seems to indicate that once the `pillar.show_pillar` has been fired, the `__opts__['file_roots']` in `renderers/jinja.py:render` stays filled with the `pillar_roots` instead of being restored to the 'regular' `file_roots`, which causes something to be unable to find `three.sls`.
I don't know why `two.sls` is unaffected by this.
