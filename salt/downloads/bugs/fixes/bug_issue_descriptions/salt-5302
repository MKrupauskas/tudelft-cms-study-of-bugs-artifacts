This issue appears to be the same as #4410.

Attempting to start the salt-minion service through salt will cause salt to hang:

```
# salt-call service.start salt-minion
[INFO ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO ] Executing command '/sbin/runlevel' in directory '/root'
[INFO ] Executing command '/sbin/chkconfig --list' in directory '/root'
[INFO ] Executing command '/sbin/service salt-minion start' in directory '/root'
... hangs indefinitely
```

Salt-minion does get started, though the salt-call job will hang indefinitely.

The above works without issue on Ubuntu and only affects Scientific Linux (and probably CentOS as they're binary compatible). This failed for me since salt 0.13 and my work around was to just not have salt manage/watch the salt minion config. 

Thanks!
