### Description
When using 'requests' backend for `http.query` state or module, it throws an error if the HTTP code is != 200. Obviously, trying to call the module from jinja2 code fails the entire state file.

'tornado' backend is not affected by this problem.

### Steps to reproduce
- expecting 200 http response code
```
check_if_exists:
  http.query:
    - name: 'https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/7/x86_64/2018.3/'
    - method: 'GET'
    - verify_ssl: False
    - backend: requests
    - status: 200
...

    Duration: 640.151 ms
     Changes:

```
- expecting any other code != 200 (404 for example)
```
should_not_exist:
  http.query:
    - name: 'https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/7/x86_64/2018.3/bla'
    - method: 'GET'
    - verify_ssl: False
    - backend: requests
    - status: 404

### Expected results
Just like the following:
- `tornado` backend, same query
```
----------
          ID: should_not_exist
    Function: http.query
        Name: https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/7/x86_64/2018.3/bla
      Result: True
     Comment: Status 404 was found, as specified.
		status: 404
		error: HTTP 404: Not Found
     Started: 10:24:44.842105
    Duration: 549.328 ms
     Changes:
```
Suggestion: you may want to change `error` to 'Not Found' since you are already reporting the status.
