Hi,

I'm trying to recursively search for files in a 'data' directory within each users 'home' dir. This works from the command line: 

```
salt '*' file.find /home/*/data
```

However, when I try it from the Python API it does not work. i.e. No file names are returned. It seems to be the wildcard (*) thats causing the problem. I tried to escape it (\*) but that makes no difference. 

``` python
import salt.config
import salt.loader
import salt.client

__opts__ = salt.config.minion_config('/etc/salt/minion')
__salt__ = salt.loader.minion_mods(__opts__)

path = '/home/*/data/'
local = salt.client.LocalClient()
print local.cmd('*', 'file.find', [path])
```
