#### When using apt-get to install salt-minion on the following setup it finds unmet dependencies:

ARM based [ts7600](http://wiki.embeddedarm.com/wiki/TS-7600) or [ts7400v2](http://wiki.embeddedarm.com/wiki/TS-7400v2) from [Technologic Systems](http://www.embeddedarm.com/) 
##### We added the following in our apt sources:

deb http://debian.saltstack.com/debian wheezy-saltstack main
##### and added the salt gpg key:

wget -q -O- "http://debian.saltstack.com/debian-salt-team-joehealy.gpg.key" | apt-key add -
#### Error:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

```
salt-minion : Depends: python-zmq (>= 13.1.0) but it is not going to be installed
               Recommends: dmidecode but it is not installable
               Recommends: debconf-utils but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
#### Workaround:

We have been working around this by manually obtaining and installing the following packages:
    http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/pyzmq/python-zmq_13.1.0-1~bpo70+1_armel.deb
    http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/msgpack-python/python-msgpack_0.3.0-1~bpo70+2_armel.deb

We were also including (in sources):  
    deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian wheezy main
