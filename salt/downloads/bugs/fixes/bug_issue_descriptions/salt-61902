**Description**
Latest Salt update is causing OS conflicts. Running CentOS7  (CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core))  in AWS and now have conflicts due to a package is wanting to install from the saltstack repo 

```
Transaction check error:
  file /usr/share/doc/python-libcloud/README.rst from install of python36-libcloud-3.2.0-1.el7.noarch conflicts with file from package python2-libcloud-2.2.1-6.el7.noarch

```
This looks to be a new add by the saltstack repo based on looking at the package info
