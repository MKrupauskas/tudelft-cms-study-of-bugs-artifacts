### Description of Issue/Question
When multiple masters share a data cache (redis in my case), targeting a subset of minions with a module returns successfully for the targeted minions. However, all minions that were not included in the target also return with a `false` value, and this causes meta-processes watching salt's exit code for errors to think something has gone wrong.

Masters sharing a data cache should not behave this way. They should match the same behavior as if the master was using a local cache: appropriate returns for targeted minions, and nothing for minions that are not targeted.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Set up a salt master and a salt syndic reporting to that master.
2. Connect some minions to the master of masters, and some to the syndic.
3. On the master of masters, issue a command limited to a subset of minions (`salt -G grain:value test.ping`, for example).
4. Receive `True` returns for the targeted minions (where the `grain` grain is set to `value` here).
5. Also receive `False` returns for minions you did not target which should not be replying at all.
6. Weep.
