### Description of Issue/Question

`boto_ec2.instance_present` throws KeyError exception when it's set to associate an EIP to an existing instance. The code was executed on the instance where EIP was to be associated.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

This is a masterless setup and the code was executed on the minion where the EIP was to be associated with it.

`eip_allocation_id` is defined in pillar:

```
# salt-call --local pillar.get eip_allocation_id
local:
    eipalloc-0da12345
```

eip.sls:
```
#!py

def run():
    config = {}
    eip_allocation_id = __salt__['pillar.get']('eip_allocation_id')
    eip = __salt__['pillar.get']('eip')
    instance_id = __salt__['grains.get']('ec2:instance_id')
    image_id = __salt__['grains.get']('ec2:image_id')

    if eip_allocation_id:
        config['associate_eip'] = {
                'boto_ec2.instance_present': [
                    {'instance_id': instance_id},
                    {'image_id': image_id},
                    {'allocation_id': eip_allocation_id}
                    ]
                }
    elif eip:
        config['associate_eip'] = {
                'boto_ec2.instance_present': [
                    {'instance_id': instance_id},
                    {'image_id': image_id},
                    {'public_ip': eip}
                    ]
                }

    return config
```
