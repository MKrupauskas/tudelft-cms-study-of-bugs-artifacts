2017.7.1 Salt Master with GitFS usage runs all commands at least 10x slower when using GitPython vs pygit2.

### Setup
* 2017.7.1 Salt Master with GitFS usage and only GitPython installed

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
* Run a highstate (because it measures execution time). This will take some time.
* Install pygit2
* Restart master
* Run same highstate and observe at least 10x speedup

### Versions Report

See above.

### Solution

Just install pygit2! I wanted to document this because it took some time to identify. The issue can be consider closed unless GitPython support is still on the roadmap.
