I've discovered that `camcontrol` is spawned a number of times on my FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE system as part of the grains disk identification. These process never seem to complete, and run indefinitely. This has caused grains generation and querying to become unusably slow. Note: I'm unable to kill these processes without rebooting the system.

This system has one SSD drive and four SATA drives, but I see a half-dozen `camcontrol` processes.
