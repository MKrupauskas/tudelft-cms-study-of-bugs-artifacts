In the documentation of salt-ssh it says:
  The standard salt functions are available! 
  The output is the same as salt and many of     the same flags are available.

cmd:

```
salt-ssh '*' test.version 
salt.example.com
    The operating system is Archlinux
    The domain is example.com

```

and another:

```
salt-ssh '*' test.ping
salt.example.com
    The operating system is Archlinux
    The domain is example.com

```

That's my MOTD if this machine....

but the raw shell is working

```
salt-ssh '*' -r 'echo "salt is cool"'
salt.example.com:
    salt is cool

```
