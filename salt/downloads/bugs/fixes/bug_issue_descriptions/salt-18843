Ran into this today, it appears that in one of our installs, the user got created at some point, but their home dir didn't. When I ran the highstate today, it errored out with the following:
local:

```
ID: xxxxxxx
Function: user.present
Result: False
Comment: These values could not be changed: {'homeDoesNotExist': '/home/xxxxxxx'}
Started: 11:30:43.057275
Duration: 6.189 ms

It looks like here the change doesn't get made, but reports it back as a change that is remaining.

Should the user.add module be called to create the home dir or should user.chhome be modified to create a homedir if one doesn't exist.
