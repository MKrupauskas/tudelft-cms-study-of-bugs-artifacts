with commit 6829daaf9c43f5f52f4afba5c0a35f1bac25870a
al network templates should be in site-packages/salt/templates if i'm correct,
but that directory isn't created with setup.py.

pwd: /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt

```
find . -name '*.jinja'
```

result no jinja files...in compiled salt dir.
