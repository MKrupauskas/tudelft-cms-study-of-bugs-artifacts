While working on https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/44525 it was noticed that the current boto_dynamodb exec module has NO error checking or handling whatsoever.  Any exception thrown by any function call (including simple API throttling errors, which should be retried) will propagate up to the top level salt handler and produce lots of ugliness in the output...

A moderate re-write is likely in order to "robustify" this code...
