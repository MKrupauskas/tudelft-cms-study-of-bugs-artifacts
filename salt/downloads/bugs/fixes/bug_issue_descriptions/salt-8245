Hi All

After battling with jinja templates I've encounter the following issue.
I've watched the issues #7625 and #8079, and updated my salt/utils/jinja.py from the develop branch

/srv/salt/jinja.test

``` jinja
{{ missing }}
{{ exists }}
```

/srv/salt/ran.sls

``` yaml
jinjaTest:
  file.managed:
    - name: /root/jinja.test
    - source: salt://jinja.test
    - template: jinja
    - defaults:
      exists: 123
```

when running `salt \* state.sls ran` the following message returns:

```
minion:
----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /root/jinja.test
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   Undefined jinja variable; line 2 in template

{{ missing }}
{{ exists }}    <======================

        Changes:

```

the error message states that the `exists` variable is not defined but the undefined variable is `missing` !
at first this looks like a minor issue but when the template file is large and full with variables its suuuuuuper hard to pin-point the problem

of course fixing the `missing`  variable fixes this problem ...
