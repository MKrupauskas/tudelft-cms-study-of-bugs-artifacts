As of commit ed315cc2068c3e969c69c66c844bacd72fedbb45, I can no longer deploy to cloud images which use "centos" as the ssh_username rather than "root"

The sftp upload step fails, because sftp runs as user 'centos', but the directory was created and owned by user root.

The below code was responsible for changing ownership of the directory to the user we're ssh-ing as. 

```
                if len(comps) > 0:
                    if len(comps) > 1 or comps[0] != 'tmp':
                        ret = root_cmd(
                            'chown {0} \'{1}\''.format(username, tmp_dir),
                            tty, sudo, **ssh_kwargs
                        )
                        if ret:
                            raise SaltCloudSystemExit(
                                'Cant set {0} ownership on {1}'.format(
                                    username, tmp_dir))
```

The condition here says 'if the directory doesn't start with /tmp OR it starts with /tmp/xxx (has at least two components), then chown it to the ssh user'. But this second part of the condition was deleted as part of ed315cc2068c3e969c69c66c844bacd72fedbb45. Therefore, the temp directory - which is usually something like /tmp/.salt-xxxx/  - is not chowned and, sftp fails because does not have permission to upload files to tmpdir.

The below patch fixed the problem for me.
