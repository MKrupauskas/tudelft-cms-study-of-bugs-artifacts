### Description of Issue/Question

Attempts to use service.running with unmask: true fails to work, although the documentation indicates that it should.  Doing a service.unmasked followed by a service.running does work.

### Setup

postgresql_service:
  service.running:
    - name: postgresql
    - enable: true
    - unmask: true

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Running the above saltstate step produces the following error, indicating that unmask: true is ignored:

ID: postgresql_service
    Function: service.running
        Name: postgresql
      Result: False
     Comment: Running scope as unit run-rf9894e4e64074350a0941db0c4d00140.scope.
              Failed to start postgresql.service: Unit postgresql.service is masked.
