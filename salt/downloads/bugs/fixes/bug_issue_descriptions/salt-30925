Hey all, this issue with the pki dir has been around for a while (#29701) and the solution was to add a `mkdir` to the packages. This now is presenting itself again but in an unexpected way.

Any how, if you run `salt-call test.version` you will be presented with:

```

[LOOP FOREVER TILL KILLED]
```

... but when correctly run it as `sudo salt-call test.version` you get:

```
local:
    2015.8.5
```

I know I was using the wrong credentials, but surely that shouldn't descend into a massive loop of output.
