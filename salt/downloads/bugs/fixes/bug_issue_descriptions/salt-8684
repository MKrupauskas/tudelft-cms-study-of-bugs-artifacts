After setting up a gitfs backend for a (private) GitHub repo, the following appeared in the master log:

```
[salt.loaded.int.fileserver.gitfs][WARNING ] GitPython exception caught while
fetching: len(["c179aa10976f1152d37e1deca0736698da8744bd\tnot-for-
merge\tbranch 'master' of git+ssh://xxx\n"]) != len(["Warning: Permanently added the 
RSA host key for IP address 'xxx' to the list of known hosts.", '', ' = [up to date]      
master     -> origin/master'])
```

Workaround was to add the following to `.ssh/config`:

```
Host github.com
User salt
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

Salt 0.17.2, Ubuntu Raring
