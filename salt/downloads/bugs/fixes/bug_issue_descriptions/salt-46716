See this error when trying to generate key using x509 on a py3 setup.

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/salt/salt/state.py", line 1878, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/root/salt/salt/loader.py", line 1823, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/root/salt/salt/states/x509.py", line 311, in private_key_managed
    ret = __states__['file.managed'](**file_args)
  File "/root/salt/salt/loader.py", line 1823, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/root/salt/salt/states/file.py", line 2267, in managed
    isinstance(use_contents, six.string_types) and '\0' in use_contents
TypeError: 'str' does not support the buffer interface
```

### Setup
Install M2Crypto and this state file:
```
certificate.authority::private-key:
  x509.private_key_managed:
    - name: /root/ca.key
    - bits: 8192
    - backup: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the state file.
Seems to work correctly on py2 but fails on py3 setup


py2:
```

          ID: certificate.authority::private-key
    Function: x509.private_key_managed
        Name: /root/ca.key
      Result: True
     Comment: File /root/ca.key updated
