When only using groups with eauth, salt token generation doesn't work.
This is both for salt -a ldap -T and the curl -sSk https://localhost:8000/login case

culprits are 
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/master.py#L2091
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/master.py#L2010
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/app.py#L1377
  where groups are not taken into account.

I have a patch in the works (against 2014.7) that uses fill_auth_list_from_groups to complement all allowed groups for a certain user in the auth_list for the token.
