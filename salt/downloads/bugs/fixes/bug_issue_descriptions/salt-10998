ldapmod has a number of deficiencies, especially over auth.ldap. Perhaps there is room for some consolidation of these two similar modules to use a single implementation to save on duplication.

First is that setting tls=True results in starttls, not ldaps as happens with auth.ldap. While supporting starttls may be useful, not supporting ldaps (and worse, having differing behaviour between auth.ldap and ldapmod) is a tad limiting.

Additionally, if one specifies ldap.tls: False in the config file instead of passing it as a parameter, the following is experienced:

```
SaltInvocationError: missing ldap.tls in config or tls in args
```

Because the check for if ldap.tls exists in the config file looks like this:

```
value = __salt__['config.option']('ldap.{0}'.format(key))
if not value:
    msg = 'missing ldap.{0} in config or {1} in args'.format(key, name)
```

If tls is set to true, this issue is not encountered.
