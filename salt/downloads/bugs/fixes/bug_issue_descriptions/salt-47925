### Description of Issue/Question
I've got a fairly simple gitfs setup that uses a single repo with 3 branches: dev, stg, and master.  I have a state file that runs a scrips that resides in a subfolder called scripts.  The script only exists in the dev branch, and the minion has the saltenv: dev configuration value and runs other sls files from that branch just fine.  When I run the state the references the script, I get the following error:

> [DEBUG   ] Could not find file 'salt://scripts/custom_cultures.ps1' in saltenv 'base'
> [ERROR   ] Unable to cache file 'salt://scripts/custom_cultures.ps1' from saltenv 'base'.

Despite the minion correctly reporting that it is in the dev environment, when I call a script by using salt://scripts/custom_cultures.ps1, it will only cache it and execute it if it exists in the master branch (base environment).

### Setup
Relevant master config settings:
```
top_file_merging_strategy: same
gitfs_remotes:
  - git@bitbucket.org:owner/repo.git
```
Relevant minion config settings:
```
saltenv: dev
lock_saltenv: True
pillarenv_from_saltenv: True
```

The repo is laid out like this (simplified for brevity):

* top.sls
* cultures.sls
* base.sls
* scripts
  * custom_cultures.ps1
  * other_scripts.ps1

Note:  The dev and master branches are exactly the same except only the dev branch contains cultures.sls and the custom_cultures.ps1 script

Contents of cultures.sls:
```
configureCustomCultures:
  cmd.script:
   - shell: powershell
   - source: salt://scripts/custom_cultures.ps1
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Lay out config files and repos as above, and from the Salt master run `salt '*' state.apply cultures`

Reported error should read:
```
salt '*' state.apply cultures
