After some debugging I have confirmed that `file.blockreplace` expects the file to which it is about to replace blocks in to exist - it it doesn't, it will fail.

Unfortunately, this wasn't clear to me because #8343 was/is preventing me to catch me the real issue.

A simple workaround for now is to manage the file before blockreplace is used.
