This configuration template:

```
STUFF=morestuff
REALLY=yes
PASSWORD={{ salt['grains.get_or_set_hash']('stuff:nested:password', 16) }}
CONFIRM=yes
```

After it has been parsed/processed by Salt the template has been applied to the minion and looks like this

```
STUFF=Foo
REALLY=yes
PASSWORD={'password': 'f&p!q*w-g%+!'}
CONFIRM=yes
```

This seems to be happening when multiple `grains.get_or_set_hash` functions are being used (with different keys)
