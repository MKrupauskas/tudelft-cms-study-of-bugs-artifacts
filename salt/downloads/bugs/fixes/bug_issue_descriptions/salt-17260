I have thousands of machines installed salt,
Once command `salt '3000 minions' test.ping` ,cpu of master cost is 30-40%
command  `salt -L '300 minions' mine.update` cpu of master cost is 100%;  (return no mine data)
this is a comparsion to prove _auth cost CPU.

Could I have a  config to  turn off the _auth between  master and  minion?
since once too many minion's _auth request  cost too many CPU on master
