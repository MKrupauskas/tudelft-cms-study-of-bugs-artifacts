Using file.recurse with salt-ssh fails with the following error:

```

The snippet from the sls file look like:

```
jenkins-plugins:
  file:
    - recurse
    - name: /var/lib/jenkins/plugins
    - source: salt://repo/jenkins/plugins
```

If a non-existing source path is specified than Salt runs fine with a message indicating the path does not exist.
