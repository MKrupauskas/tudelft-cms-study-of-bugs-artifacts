### Description of Issue/Question

When provisioning a freebsd vm with salt-cloud and bootstrap-salt.sh the preseeded key gets put into /etc/salt, when it should be put into /usr/local/etc/salt/. When using just bootstrap and starting the minion service by hand key's are populated appropriately.
### Setup

`salt-cloud -p <cloud-provider>-freebsd10 test-freebsd10`

If you're using rackspace it looks like, `salt-cloud -p rs-freebsd10 test-freebsd10`
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Wait for the salt-cloud provision to finish and fail.

On the new freebsd minion check both /etc/salt/pki/ and /usr/local/etc/salt/pki/. Both directories will have the key placed in them.
