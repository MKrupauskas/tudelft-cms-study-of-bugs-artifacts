### Description of Issue/Question

With the upgrade to Salt 2017.7.0, installing multiple SPM packages at once fails with an uncaught exception. Installing one package at a time still works OK.

### Setup

SPM should be configured to point to a repo with multiple packages.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Running (assuming that `foo` and `bar` packages exist in the repo):

```sh
spm install -y -f foo bar
```

produces this error:

```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: "filename 'foo/FORMULA' not found"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/spm", line 12, in <module>
    salt_spm()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 487, in salt_spm
    spm.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/spm.py", line 34, in run
    client.run(self.args)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/spm/__init__.py", line 113, in run
    self._install(args)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/spm/__init__.py", line 363, in _install
    self._install_indv_pkg(package, out_file)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/spm/__init__.py", line 455, in _install_indv_pkg
    formula_ref = formula_tar.extractfile('{0}/FORMULA'.format(pkg_name))
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/tarfile.py", line 2111, in extractfile
    tarinfo = self.getmember(member)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/tarfile.py", line 1796, in getmember
    raise KeyError("filename %r not found" % name)
KeyError: "filename 'foo/FORMULA' not found"
```

Though exactly which file is reported as "not found" is consistent for the same list of packages, it's not always the first one.
