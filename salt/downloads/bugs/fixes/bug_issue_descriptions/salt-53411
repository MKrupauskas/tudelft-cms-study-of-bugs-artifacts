### Description of Issue

When `event_listen_queue` on the master is set to large values (to reduce load and increase performance on busy infrastructures), in some cases there can be a lull in event traffic that will cause events in the listen queue to get stale.  This creates the impression that jobs are taking much longer to complete than they should.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Set `event_listen_queue` in `/etc/salt/master` to a large value (2500 for example).  Restart the master.  Wait for minions to reconnect.  Run some commands (`test.ping` is sufficient).  Note that it can take a long time for results to come back and/or the CLI may report minions as being disconnected.
