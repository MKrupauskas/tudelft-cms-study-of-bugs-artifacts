**Description**
I have attempted to create a meta state "node/init.sls":

```
{% set sls_file = "node." ~ grains.get('host') %}

{% if salt['state.sls_exists'](sls_file, saltenv=saltenv) -%}
include:
  - {{ sls_file }}
{%- endif %}
```

The idea here is i can setup a state file for minions at the root of the fileserver in "node/hostname.sls" where hostname is the short hostname of a minion.

so for instance {{ sls_file }} would be rendered as "node.foo" for foo.example.com

and my fileserver has: "node/foo.sls" in both my testing saltenv and in base

this works in base, bot not in any other saltenv. state.show_states does not list any states further included from node/foo.sls and state.apply node does not show any of the state code in node/foo.sls being executed when specifying saltenv=

It works entirely when not specifying saltenv (in base)


**Expected behavior**
node.foo (node/foo.sls) would be included in the state run and
`salt 'foo.example.com' state.sls_exists node.foo saltenv=test`
would return "True" not "False"
