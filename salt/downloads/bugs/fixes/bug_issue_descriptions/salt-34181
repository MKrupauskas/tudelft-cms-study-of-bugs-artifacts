### Description of Issue/Question

yaml_dquote filter uses the basic yaml Emitter which adds a Emitter.best_line_break when Emitter.column > Emitter.best_width (+ some additional yaml criteria). This works for yaml but doesnt work when using these strings inside sls files.
### Setup

```
{% set v='"'*42 %}
/tmp/t.sh:
    file.managed:
        - contents: |
            # Environment variables
            export VAR={{ v | yaml_dquote }}            
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Execute the above sls, you will notice a newline is inserted before the last double quote.
