### Description of Issue/Question
`timezone.system` does not properly reject invalid timezones, claiming all changes are successful. This causes errors to slip by undetected, unless one is watching the error output when running highstate.

From my current investigation I think this should be fixed in the `timezone.zone_compare` function, since it never validates that the given timezone is valid. As can be seen on [line 283](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/timezone.py#L283), as long as the current zone is found and has a different name from the one given, it's just assumed to be unequal. However, [later in the function](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/timezone.py#L298) it raises a `SaltInvocationError` due to invalid timezone, which I believe also should also be raised when the given zone is invalid.

I also noted while reading this function that at [some point](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/timezone.py#L291) it returns an error as a string, which also causes silent failure since the output is supposed to be boolean, and the string evaluates to `True`. That can probably easily be fixed to raise an exception while fixing the other issue reported here in the same function.

### Setup
This state succeeds:
```yaml
# timezone.sls
timezone:
    timezone.system:
        - name: bogus
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
$ sudo salt-call state.sls timezone
[ERROR   ] Command 'timedatectl set-timezone bogus' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: Failed to set time zone: Invalid time zone 'bogus'
local:
----------
          ID: timezone
    Function: timezone.system
        Name: bogus
      Result: True
     Comment: Set timezone bogus

The state should have had `Result: False`.
