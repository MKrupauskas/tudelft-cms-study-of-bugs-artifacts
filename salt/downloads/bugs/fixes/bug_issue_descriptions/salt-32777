### Description of Issue/Question

when specifying a user for cron.present, the job ends up in the root crontab!

``` bash
[root@cronos /salt/states/common/cron]# crontab -l
# Lines below here are managed by Salt, do not edit
# SALT_CRON_IDENTIFIER:echo hello world > /dev/null
15 * * * * echo hello world > /dev/null
```

``` bash
[root@cronos /salt/states/common/cron]# crontab -l sjorge
crontab: can't open your crontab file.
```

Worse, this was root's contrab before the state:

``` bash
#ident  "%Z%%M% %I%     %E% SMI"
