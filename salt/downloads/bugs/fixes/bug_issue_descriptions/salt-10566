Upgraded salt-minion from 0.17.2 to 0.17.5.  Initial restart of the minions did not pick up custom sync'd _modules/.

Looking on disk, the files were present:
/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/modules/cust.py
/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/modules/cust.pyc
/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_modules/cust.py

However, calls returned cust.method were not available.  Restarting the minions a second time restored functionality, as did calling saltutil.sync_modules against the remaining minions, although no files were transfered so only internal cache appears to have been modified.
