**Description**

When using the `hold` argument of the [`pkg.installed`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.pkg.html#salt.states.pkg.installed) state with a package that is not yet installed, the `hold` status is not set.  An error log is shown.  The package install completes, but the hold part fails.

Observed on CentOS 7, and OpenSUSE 15 (with wip in #56935).
