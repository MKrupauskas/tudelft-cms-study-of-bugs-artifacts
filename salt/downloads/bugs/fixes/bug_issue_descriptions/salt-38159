### Description of Issue/Question
When a minion on windows tries to push a directory under a Linux master and the directory has sub directories then the paths are created with windows folder separation.

when trying to push c:\salt\conf

```
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Dec  8 14:56 \salt\conf\pki\minion
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Dec  8 14:56 \salt\conf\minion.d
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Dec  8 14:56 \salt\conf
 ```
