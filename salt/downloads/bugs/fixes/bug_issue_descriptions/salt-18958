Much to my suprise no one else has reported this. At least not that google can find. I've been getting it on all my machines since this summer. I had hoped that salt 2014.7 would fix this, but to my huge dismay it hasn't. I'm clueless on how to fix this. I can't even get it to happen predictably. basically I just turn on my test machine and let it run until it crashes. Doesn't usually take to long. here are a set of 3 logs to hopefully shed some light:

This is a completely clean minion. Fresh operating system. The first log is from when I first started the minion to when it first crashed. You can see that I do some test pings and then I have it run highstate, it was still running that when I left for the day. but the next morning it was crashed. Appearently it crashed around 21:20. anyway. So I restarted the minion, there comes log two. I deleted the log file inbetween to keep it small. I let it run till it crashed, rebooted, took the log, rinse, repeat, log 3. 

So I figured I'd include --versions as that is a frequent request. Check this out:
