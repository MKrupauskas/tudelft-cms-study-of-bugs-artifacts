**Description**
When using the `file.managed` state module to enforce user and/or group ownership, if `mode` is not specified, a pending change related to mode will be reported when the state is run with `test=True`.

**Setup**
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (be sure to remove sensitive info).
Create a test file. For example, /opt/testmyperms.txt
```
# touch /opt/testmyperms.txt
# chown root.root /opt/testmyperms.txt
# chmod 644 /opt/testmyperms.txt
```

Create a state file that enforces ownership of the file.
# cat /srv/salt/setperms.sls
```
enforce_ownership:
  file.managed:
    - name: /opt/testmyperms.txt
    - replace: False
    - user: root
    - group: root
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Apply the state above with the `test=True` option.

```
# salt-call --local state.sls setperms test=True
local:
----------
          ID: enforce_ownership
    Function: file.managed
        Name: /opt/testmyperms.txt
      Result: True
     Comment: File /opt/testmyperms.txt will be updated with permissions None from its current state of 0644

Summary for local

```
Apply the state
```
]# salt-call --local state.sls setperms
local:
----------
          ID: enforce_ownership
    Function: file.managed
        Name: /opt/testmyperms.txt
      Result: True
     Comment: File /opt/testmyperms.txt exists with proper permissions. No changes made.

**Expected behavior**
Pending changes to a file's mode should only be considered or reported if `mode` is specified in the state.
