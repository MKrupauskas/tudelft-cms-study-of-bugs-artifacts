While testing some stuff inside docker I get : 

```
Function: postgres_user.present
        Name: logidemo
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1531, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/postgres_user.py", line 217, in present
                  if password is not None and (refresh_password or user_attr['password'] != password):
              TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

As it happens, eventough I have a  

```
  service.running:
    - name: postgresql
[snip]
   require: 
      - service: postgresql
```

I still get that. I believe postgres.get_role is sending back False instead of a dictionary.
