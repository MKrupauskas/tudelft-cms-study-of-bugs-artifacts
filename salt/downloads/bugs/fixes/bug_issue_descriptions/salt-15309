I do not know if I am doing it wrong or if it is a bug, I have reproduced the behavior with:
- both master and minion in 2014.1.7
- both master and minion in 2014.1.4

I want to store the grain 'virtual' in the mine using `grains.item`. I can do the mine.send (answers true), but the mine.get does not return anything. If I instead use `grains.get`, everything works as expected.

what doesn not work as expected:

``` bash
root@salt:/etc/salt# salt 'host1*' mine.send grains.item virtual
host1.domain.fr:
    True
root@salt:/etc/salt# salt 'host1*' mine.get 'host1*' grains.item
host1.domain.fr:
    ----------
root@salt:/etc/salt# salt 'host1*' mine.get 'host1*' grains.item virtual
host1.domain.fr:
    ----------
```

and what works as expected:

``` bash
root@salt:/etc/salt# salt 'host1*' mine.send grains.get virtual
host1.domain.fr:
    True
root@salt:/etc/salt# salt 'host1*' mine.get 'host1*' grains.get
host1.domain.fr:
    ----------
    host1.domain.fr:
        physical
```

The point of using "grains.item" and not "grains.get" is to keep the key "virtual" in the mine.

I have tried to wait longer for returns by using the lookup_jid for the jobs but it does not change anything.

This issue has common points with: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8144 and https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/6340 but they do not seem to be the same.
