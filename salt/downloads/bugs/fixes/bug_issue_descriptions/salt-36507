As demonstrated in #36148, the `/keys` endpoint does not catch `EauthAuthenticationError` and returns a 500 instead of a 403. Ugly.

This is because the Keys() class is not using the hypermedia handler. I don't recall why it is not. Investigate if that handler can be used here (it might need to gain direct support for tar/zip files). Also investigate if the error-handling should be moved out of that handler into a separate check since that handler it concerned with the response format and not necessarily the response status code.
