I just noticed that when I schedule highstate runs in salt no return events are created. I write a little scipt that monitors the event bus on the master and picks up return data for highstate runs and creates status information from them. The problem is that this works for manual runs like "salt '_' state.highstate" on the master, manual runs using "salt-call state.highstate" on the minion but *not_ when the runs are initiated using the scheduler and it's not clear why that should be the case.

I'm not sure if this a bug or intentional although I cannot think of a reason why salt-call should return data and scheduled runs should not.
