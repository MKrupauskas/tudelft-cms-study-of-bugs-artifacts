### Description of Issue/Question

Attempting to use the slack.changes option to reduce the output sent to Slack channel when using the returner. As documented it should only return entries that either had changes or failed to execute. My testing has not shown that to be true.
### Setup

Setup /etc/salt/minion.d/returners.conf with the follwing:

```
slack.api_key: XXX-REDACTED-XXX
slack.as_user: true
slack.channel: '#general'
slack.username: saltstack
slack.changes: true
```

Then restart the salt-minion to load the configuration
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I have a simple route53 state that calls boto_route53.present but as I currenly have boto 2.34.0 and boto_route53 requires 2.35.0 or higher it is assured to generate a failed entry when ran.

Running **salt MINION state.sls route53 test=False --return slack --output yaml** I get the following
output on my terminal I executed it from:

```
MINION:
  boto_route53_|-r53_a_record_|-MINION_|-present:
    __run_num__: 1
    changes: {}
    comment: 'State ''boto_route53.present'' was not found in SLS ''route53''

      Reason: ''boto_route53'' __virtual__ returned False

'
    name: MINION
    result: false
  pkg_|-boto_pkg_|-python-boto_|-installed:
    __id__: boto_pkg
    __run_num__: 0
    changes: {}
    comment: Package python-boto is already installed
    duration: 413.451
    name: python-boto
    result: true
    start_time: '03:57:57.568486'
```

While this is the output I expect it to generate... I don't recieve anything in my Slack channel. If I remove the slack.changes option from the returners.conf, restart the salt-minion and then re-execute the same command I do get the report to my Slack channel for both return ID items.
