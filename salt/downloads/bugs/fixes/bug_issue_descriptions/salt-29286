Hi - First off, thanks for all everyone does on this software! It is greatly appreciated.

My issue is that we seem to be unable to disable our job cache. Our salt version is:

```
salt 2015.5.4 (Lithium)
```

Our master configuration looks like this:

```
worker_threads: 10
open_mode: True
job_cache: False
keep_jobs: 0
fileserver_backend:
  - git
gitfs_provider: gitpython
gitfs_remotes:
  - git+ssh://git@github.com/notourrealcompany/salt.git
gitfs_base: master
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/pillar
```

My process to recreate is:
- Stop the salt-master process
- Remove all directories in `/var/cache/salt/master/jobs`
- Start up the salt-master process
- Lots of directories/uuids/jids return to the `/var/cache/salt/master/jobs` directory

Our use case here is that we have similar symptoms to #10443 and we don't see (or don't currently understand) what the job cache provides us. We've filled up our disk a couple of times and were looking for a more permanent solution than adding a cron task to remove older files in the cache.

Thanks again!

Harlan
