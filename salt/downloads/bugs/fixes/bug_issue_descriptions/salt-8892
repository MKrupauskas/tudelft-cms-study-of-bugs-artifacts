This is on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Salt 0.17.2.

The `network` states module should not have been loaded on an Ubuntu machine,  since it does not provide the `ip.get_interface` execution module/function.

```
    State: - network
    Name:      eth0
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1278, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/network.py", line 190, in managed
    old = __salt__['ip.get_interface'](name)
KeyError: 'ip.get_interface'
```

I cannot investigate this further at this time (time and priority constraints).
