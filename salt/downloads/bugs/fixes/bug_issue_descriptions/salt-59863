**Description**
When you are using the hetzner driver for saltcloud and try to rollout a machine, via a map

```
salt-cloud -m my.map
```

there is an error which pops up, caused by trying to convert a `PrivateNet`-model from package `hcloud` into an dictionary by using a property which doesn't exist in the model.

Without DEBUG output level, this bug causes the map rollout to not recognize that this machine is already existing and tries to roll it out nevertheless.

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to execute 'hetzner.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: 'PrivateNet' object has no attribute 'ipv4'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2367, in run_parallel_map_providers_query

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/hetzner.py", line 184, in list_nodes
    nodes = list_nodes_full()

    log.info(net.ipv4)
AttributeError: 'PrivateNet' object has no attribute 'ipv4'
```

**Expected behavior**
`salt-cloud -m my.map` should not even try to rollout a machine which already exists in a hetzner project.
