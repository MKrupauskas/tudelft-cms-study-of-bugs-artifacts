### Description of Issue
Two issues:
- When `salt_proxy.configure_proxy` was ran, `/etc/salt/proxy` existed and contained default data. It appear like it was left over from an older version of SaltStack. The master property was empty, so the proxy minion failed to connect to the master.
- When the `/etc/salt/proxy` file was removed manually, `salt_proxy.configure_proxy` created an invalid yaml file which caused `salt-proxy` to fail to startup:

```
Command '[u'salt-proxy', u'--proxyid={{ minion }}', u'-l', u'info', u'-d']' failed with return code: 1
2019-06-02 21:56:26,055 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod:778 ][ERROR   ][80325] stderr: [ERROR   ] Error parsing configuration file: /etc/salt/proxy - conf should be a document, not <type 'unicode'>.
```

The file contained:

```
master = {{ salt master }}
```

### Setup

Using the following state, with either an empty proxy configuration file or the default (just comments).

proxy.sls
```
Ensure proxy for minion {{ minion }} exists:
  salt_proxy.configure_proxy:
    - proxyname: {{ minion }}
    - start: true
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

salt-call state.apply proxy
