### Issue

in source code of module:
 # Action Settings
    task_action = task_definition.Actions.Create(action_types[action_type])
    if action_types[action_type] == TASK_ACTION_EXEC:
        task_action.Id = 'Execute_ID1'
        if kwargs.get('cmd', False):

'Execute_ID1'-but first action was already created. 
### Workaround Solution:

remove already created first action. After that
salt winclient1 task.add_action MyTask cmd="ping 10.10.111.140"
works as expected.
