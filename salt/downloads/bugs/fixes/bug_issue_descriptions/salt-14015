Hi,

Am not sure if it's a bug or not, but when I create a CA with version 3, I'd expect (after creating csr) the certificate to also be version 3 ? However, I seem to always get CA v3 and CERT v1 : 

```
[root@sensu certs]# openssl x509 -text -in ../sensu-rabbitmq-ca_ca_cert.crt 
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
```

```
[root@sensu certs]# openssl x509 -text -in sensu-rabbit-server-cert.crt 
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 1 (0x0)
        Serial Number:
```

Can someone re-create this to confirm ?

Thanks,
Alex
