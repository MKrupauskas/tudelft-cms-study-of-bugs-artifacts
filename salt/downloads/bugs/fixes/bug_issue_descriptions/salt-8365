on Fedora later than 17, many previously static, on-disk files have been moved into tmpfs mounts.  See [their rationale](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/var-run-tmpfs).

Either way, when a Fedora system boots, /var/run (symlinked into /run, which is mounted with tmpfs) is empty.  The salt-minion doesn't attempt to create the directory (or test for its existence, AFAICT) prior to trying to write a file there. 

Our hack was to have our salt systemd unit file (using execstartpre) create the directory before executing salt-minion.

Below, is the traceback we receive:
