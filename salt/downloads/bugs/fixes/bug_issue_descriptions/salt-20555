Hey, 

This isn't a specific problem for me I just noticed that I was unable to unzip symbolic files (after my changes to archive.unzip and zipfile) which I have fixed with #20554, but don't have time right now to do the same for zipping :(, and wanted to make sure this isn't forgotten.

We need to check to see if the file/directory is a symbolic link before zipping it up an example of which is noted here: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2005-June/334950.html

I imagine the current implementation will fail silently.
