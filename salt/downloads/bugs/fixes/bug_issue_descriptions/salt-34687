I am trying to test salt-cloud saltify to deploy/install salt-minions on target machines.

I created three vagrant machines and names them master, minion-01and minion-02.

all the machines were same like this;

```
root@master:/home/vagrant# lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
Release:    14.04
Codename:   trusty
```

then on master I followed this http://repo.saltstack.com/#ubuntu to install salt-master(manually of course).

then in master I added these three files.

**in /etc/salt/cloud.providers:**

```
root@master:/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d# cat bare_metal.conf 
my-saltify-config:
  minion:
    master: 192.168.33.10
  driver: saltify
```

**in /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d:**

```
root@master:/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d# cat saltify.conf 
make_salty:
  provider: my-saltify-config
  script_args: git v2016.3.1
```

**/etc/salt/saltify-map**

```

root@master:/etc/salt# cat saltify-map 
make_salty:
  - minion-01:
      ssh_host: 192.168.33.11
      ssh_username: vagrant
      password: vagrant
  - minion-02:
      ssh_host: 192.168.33.12
      ssh_username: vagrant
      password: vagrant
```

then on minion I ran `salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/saltify-map` It was very slow but It ran without errors. keys of both minion-01 and minion-02 was accepted by salt master.

I could do this:

```
   root@master:/home/vagrant# salt 'minion*' test.ping
    minion-01:
        True
    minion-02:
        True

```

and this;

```
root@master:/home/vagrant# salt-key 
Accepted Keys:
minion-01
minion-02
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
The Problem;

```

Now when I again executed this **salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/saltify-map** salt-master re-ran the whole execution and then I had this;

```

root@master:/home/vagrant# salt 'minion*' test.ping
minion-02:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
minion-01:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

and this;

```
root@master:/etc/salt# salt-key 
Accepted Keys:
minion-01
minion-02
Denied Keys:
minion-01
minion-02
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
```

In short salt-cloud is not acting idempotent.

What am I doing wrong ?

The second problem is, though on the first run salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/saltify-map installs and accepts key of minion-01 and minion-02 on salt-master, but the minion machines have all these things installed along with salt-minion

```
root@minion-02:/home/vagrant# salt
salt         salt-call    salt-cp      salt-master  salt-proxy   salt-ssh     salt-unity
salt-api     salt-cloud   salt-key     salt-minion  salt-run     salt-syndic 
```

How do I make sure that only salt-minion gets installed.

Thanks.

PS:

```

root@master:/etc/salt# salt-master --version
salt-master 2016.3.1 (Boron)
```
