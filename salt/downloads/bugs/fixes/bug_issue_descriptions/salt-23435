In FreeBSD, service onestatus currently returns 1 if either the service is not running, or it simply doesn't exist.  This seems to be proper handling of the service not existing case, but Salt should not treat a down status as an error:

```
# salt-call service.status moo
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/sbin/service moo onestatus' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: moo does not exist in /etc/rc.d or the local startup
directories (/usr/local/etc/rc.d)
local:
    False
```

```
# salt-call service.status inetd
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/sbin/service inetd onestatus' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: inetd is not running.
local:
    False
```

We possibly need to parse the return on a 1, and in the case of 'is not running', squelch the error?

The simple state that is triggering this is service.dead:

```
freebsd_inetd:
  service.dead:
    - name: inetd
```
