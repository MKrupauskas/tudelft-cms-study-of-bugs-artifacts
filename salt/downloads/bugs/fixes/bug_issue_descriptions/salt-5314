After upgrading to 0.15.1 the compound targeting doesn't behave the same:

Works for all minions:

```
salt -C 'G@project:api and ( G@roles:web or G@roles:taskworker or G@roles:websocket )' test.ping
```

Does not match 0.15.1 minions:

```
salt -C 'G@project:api and (G@roles:web or G@roles:taskworker or G@roles:websocket)' test.ping
```

As you can see, adding a space after parentheses fixes the issue I have.
