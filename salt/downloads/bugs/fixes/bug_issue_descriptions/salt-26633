Hi, I have some unicode in pillar, that I wan't to push into a json file with file.serialize. It seems to me that the data is passed fin through pillar:

``` console
$ salt-call pillar.get myky
name:
         non umlauts f√ºr umlauts
```

I am rendering it with a file.serialize state

``` saltstack
mystate:
  file.serialize:
    - name: {{ path }}/file.json
    - user: {{ user }}
    - makedirs: True
    - dataset: {{ data_read_from_pillar }}
    - formatter: JSON
```

And in the file I end up with a broken string

``` python
{ "name": "non umlauts f\\xc3\\xbcr umlauts" }
```

Which looks to me like a double escape.
