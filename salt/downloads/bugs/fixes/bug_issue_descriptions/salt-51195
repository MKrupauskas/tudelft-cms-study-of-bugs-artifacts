### Description of Issue/Question
This is similar to issue #27160 but in the options

### Setup
Basically, mounting a CIFS drive with a linux who joined an active directory. I am assuming that it should work with local group name with spaces inside too.
```
/mnt/share:
  mount.mounted:
    - fstype: cifs
    - persist: True
    - mkmnt: True
    - mount: True
    - device: //share.local/share
    - dump: 0
    - pass_num: 0
    - opts: credentials=/root/.smbpasswd,uid=jenkins,gid=utilisateurs\ du\ domaine
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running the state will properly mount the drive
```
          ID: /mnt/share
    Function: mount.mounted
      Result: True
     Comment: Target was successfully mounted. Added new entry to the fstab.
     Started: 12:13:07.855852
    Duration: 533.336 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              mount:
                  True
              persist:
                  new
```

But will not write a correct config to fstab ('\ ' instead of '\040')
Current behaviour
```
//share.local/share  /mnt/share  cifs  credentials=/root/.smbpasswd,uid=jenkins,gid=utilisateurs\ du\ domaine  0 0
```
Expected behaviour
```
//share.local/share /mnt/share  cifs 
 credentials=/root/.smbpasswd,uid=jenkins,gid=utilisateurs\040du\040domaine  0 0
```
This prevent the drive to be mounted at boot
