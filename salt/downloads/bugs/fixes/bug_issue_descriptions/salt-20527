You can specify version comparison operators to pkg.installed and in test mode it works as expected but when it comes to driving apt-get it fails.

Perhaps best illustrated as an example:

```
$ sudo salt-call state.single pkg.installed ntp version='>=1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.2' test=true
[...]
local:
----------
          ID: ntp
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: None
     Comment: The following packages are set to be installed/updated: ntp>=1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.2.
     Changes:

```

Which is all good so far, I've asked for greater than or equal to a version not installed. Similarly for '<=':

```
$ sudo salt-call state.single pkg.installed ntp version='<=1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.2' test=true
[...]
local:
----------
          ID: ntp
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: All specified packages are already installed and are at the desired version.
     Changes:
```

But when I come to try to actually install I get this:

```
$ sudo salt-call state.single pkg.installed ntp version='>=1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.2'

I'm not quite sure the behaviour I _would_ expect here, but I was after was basically this: ensure that ntp is at least this version, but if it's more recent then that's good too.

In terms of implementation that would require stripping the '>=' off inside the state and passing no version to the module. That would work for apt but I don't know if that would break for other package modules.
