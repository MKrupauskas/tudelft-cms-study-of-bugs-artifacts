Hello,

I'm trying to mount some NFS shares on my servers and it seems that I'm facing the same problem as the unresolved issues #15289 and #53688 .

```

```

```
/mnt/backup:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: myserver:/nfs/backup
    - fstype: nfs
    - options: "vers=4.1,hard,proto=tcp,sec=sys"
    - mkmnt: true
    - persist: true
```

At the first execution, the folder is created and the mount is done.

Then, for all the others executions I get : 

```
     ID: /mnt/backup
    Function: mount.mounted
      Result: True
     Comment: Target was successfully mounted. Entry already exists in the fstab.
     Started: 14:18:59.361976
    Duration: 322.251 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              mount:
                  True
              umount:
                  Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: myserver:/nfs/backup, current: myserver:/nfs/backup, /root/myserver:/nfs/backup
```

Same in python :

```
>>> os.path.realpath('myserver:/nfs/backup')
'/root/myserver:/nfs/backup'

```

Am I doing something wrong ?

Regards,

Johan
