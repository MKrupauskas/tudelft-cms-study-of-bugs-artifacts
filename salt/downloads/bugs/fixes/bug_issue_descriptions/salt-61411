**Description**
The Salt Mine Runner module does not returns any results if the salt mines are covered by minion-side ACLs (probably server side too).

**Setup**
Salt 3004 standard configuration running in a container.
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Execute the following shell command:
`salt-run mine.get '*' <any_mine_function>` 

**Expected behavior**
Salt Master should be able to read any salt mine stored in its cache.
