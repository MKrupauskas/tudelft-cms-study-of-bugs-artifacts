Calling multiple runner functions at the same time execute synchronously and block. The second one will not start executing until the first is finished. This is problematic for long-running runners such as the orchestrate runner.

``` bash
% salt-call event.fire_master '{done_file: "/tmp/one"}' 'myco/custom/event' &
salt-call event.fire_master '{done_file: "/tmp/two"}' 'myco/custom/event' &
salt-call event.fire_master '{done_file: "/tmp/three"}' 'myco/custom/event' &
```
