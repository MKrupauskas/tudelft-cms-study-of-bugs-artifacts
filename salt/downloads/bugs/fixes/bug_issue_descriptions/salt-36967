### Description of Issue/Question

Salt-master only fetches first 1000 objects in AWS S3 bucket. If there're more objects - they are silently ignored.

S3 REST API returns only 1000 objects at a time. "max-keys" request parameter is responsible for this limit and it can be set to lower value, but values bigger than 1000 are ignored. According to AWS documentation, if bucket contains more than "max-keys" objects (1000 by default), application has to send another request(s) with updated "marker" parameter: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGET.html
Also, while trying to fetch bucket with more than 1000 objects Salt master gets `<IsTruncated>true</IsTruncated>` in response from S3 API.
### Setup

AWS Roles are used, so there're no s3 credentials used.
Master config (only relevant):

```
fileserver_backend:
  - roots
  - s3fs

file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/state

s3.buckets:
  base:
    - <redacted>

```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Put more than 1000 objects to s3 bucket. Use it in s3fs backend on Salt master.
2. Try to fetch files from S3. For instance, with:

```
import salt.utils.s3 as s3
s3.query(key=None, keyid=None, bucket='<redacted>')
```

or from salt master:

```
salt-call cp.list_master
```
