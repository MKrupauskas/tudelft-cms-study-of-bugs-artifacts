### Description of Issue/Question
After change  #50844 the os_release grain is None on Windows Embedded Standard systems. And because there's logic that expects the os_release grain is set, the salt-minion doesn't start.
It seems that the os info.caption is "Windows Embedded Standard ". Since the caption doesn't contain the version in it, the new code resolves the osrelease grain to unknown. 
Note that the platform.release() returned the correct version (7) on windows embedded standard 7. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the salt-minion on Windows Embedded Standard 7 and it will crash because the osrelease grain is None. I have tested with salt-minion 2018.3 (python3)
