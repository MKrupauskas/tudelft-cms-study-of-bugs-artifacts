The entire condition/error block in the code is redundant to the function of the underlying command. 

```
    if device:
        dev = device.replace('/dev/', '')
        if dev not in os.listdir('/dev'):
            raise CommandExecutionError(
                'Invalid device passed to partition.probe'
            )
```

When `partprobe` is called the first thing it does is an `lstat` syscall on each of it's args. The result of this `lstat` is used to both verify the existence of the files and also to test if they are appropriate nodes for block devices. So, the "pre-test" for their existence in the output of `os.listdir` is unnecessary, insufficient for the case where a file exists with a matching path but is of the wrong type and also inherently racy since nothing prevents the creation or removal of the path before the underlying `partprobe` command is called.
