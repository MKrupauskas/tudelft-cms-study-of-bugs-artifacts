because of this line.

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners/mongo_return.py#L120

```
    if float(version.split('.')[0]) >= 3 or float(version) > 2.3:
        conn = pymongo.MongoClient(host, port)
    else:
        conn = pymongo.Connection(host, port)
```

I am using this right now, but yall will probably want to fix it in a better way.

Also, it is giving a warning that insert is deprecated.

```
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/returners/mongo_return.py:155: DeprecationWarning: insert is deprecated. Use insert_one or insert_many instead.
  mdb.saltReturns.insert(sdata)
```
