**Description**

Have locally set LOG_ROTATE_MAX_BYTES to a low number appended to end of config file, restarted service, and confirmed with 'C:\salt\salt-call.bat config.get LOG_ROTATE_MAX_BYTES' that the setting has been applied.

Existing log C:\salt\var\log\salt\minion is larger than that value (50meg), file doesn't change after restart. After errors are logged into that log the log file doesn't change size. 

**Setup**
At end of standard minion config file;
LOG_ROTATE_MAX_BYTES: 1024

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
n/a

**Expected behavior**
Forums and config seem to indicate that after the agent is restarted, the log would be truncated.
