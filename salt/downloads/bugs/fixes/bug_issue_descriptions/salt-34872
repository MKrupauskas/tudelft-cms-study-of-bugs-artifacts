This is a setup I've been using for about a year, on a variety of 2015 versions, with no issue. Upgrading the minion to 2016.3.1 makes it stop working. I believe it's long-running commands, but maybe something else specific to what I'm doing. 

Take the following state: 

```
gzcat /root/image-latest.img.gz | dd of=/dev/null bs=1M:
  cmd.run
```

Where image-latest.img.gz is a gzipped disk image file, which in normal operation is sent to dd with output to a hard drive, but for sake of example, /dev/null behaves in the same way. Any sufficiently large gz file (100 MB would suffice) will show the end result problem. 

When executing that state from the master via `salt my-deploy state.sls write-disk`, the master claims the minion didn't return.

```

But if you watch the minion's log, it's running the command, and it finishes successfully. So the minion works, it just apparently doesn't reply back to the master, leaving it thinking it disconnected. 

Minion log when master reports "Minion did not return".

Master log from 2015.8.1 which works correctly.

The OS used doesn't matter either way, FreeBSD 10.2 with any 2015 salt version works fine.
