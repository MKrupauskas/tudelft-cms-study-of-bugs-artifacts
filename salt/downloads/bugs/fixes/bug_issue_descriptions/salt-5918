I'm having an issue setting the mysql root password the first time on a new masterless configuration.

What I want to do is change it from the default to something else.  I think you have the option to set it when you install typically, but that step is skipped with the automated install.

Here's what I think the issue is:

I have to define the username and password to access the mysql database in the config file, but when configuring the root user in the salt state file, it trys to access the database using the password that has not yet been set.

Is this a known issue?  I saw issue #3831 but `_connect()` still uses the root credentials in the config file (i.e. works for everyone but root).
