Hi,

salt-common 2014.1.10 packages for lucid and precise that can be found here http://ppa.launchpad.net/saltstack/salt/ubuntu/pool/main/s/salt/ have python-requests dependency, which is not necessary for salt-minion. Official ubuntu repository contains outdated python-requests package, which overriden python-requests installed via pip. Because of this installation of salt-minion caused issues for applications, that were using newer version of python-requests. Since python-requests is used only by salt-master would it be possible to remove this dependency from salt-common package and add it to salt-master instead?

Thanks,
Kirill.
