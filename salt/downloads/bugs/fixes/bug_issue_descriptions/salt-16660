The git_pillar "ext_pillar" is very specially handled by salt. See the following links for code:
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/master.py#L146
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/daemons/masterapi.py#L50

This makes the git_pillar work like no other ext pillar. The problems include at least the following:
- Git_pillar cannot be stacked like more ext_pillars due to be run in a different place from other ext pillars.
- Git_pillar does not follow the docs at http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/external_pillars.html#ext-pillar. At the very least, the args for the ext_pillar function in salt.pillar.git_pillar are not like the documented args.
