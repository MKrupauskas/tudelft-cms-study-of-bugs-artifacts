**Description**

I believe the snapper module's `_is_text_file` has been broken as part of the security vulnerabilities that were fixed in this pull request: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/59648

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Attempt to run the snapper module's diff function. Or you can run the following code to test (copied from snapper module):

```python
import subprocess

def _is_text_file(filename):
    """
    Checks if a file is a text file
    """
    type_of_file = subprocess.run(
        ["file", "-bi", filename],
        check=False,
        stdout=subprocess.STDOUT,
        universal_newlines=True,
    ).stdout
    return type_of_file.startswith("text")

_is_text_file('textfile.txt')
```

If you test this out just in a python file you notice it errors with the following:

```
OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor
```

**Expected behavior**
For _is_text_file to function correctly  

**Additional context**

** Fix **

This is fixed by changing `STDOUT` to `PIPE`. Example:

```python
def _is_text_file(filename):
    """
    Checks if a file is a text file
    """
    type_of_file = subprocess.run(
        ["file", "-bi", filename],
        check=False,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        universal_newlines=True,
    ).stdout
    return type_of_file.startswith("text")
```

I would be happy to submit a pull request for this if this fix is acceptable.

Note that I attempted to notify you of this via the security email address but was ignored. I have detailed the security vulnerability that was fixed by the previous pull request here:
