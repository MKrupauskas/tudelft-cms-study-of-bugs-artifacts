**Description**
I started going down a rabbit hole with this one. And thought I would put this ticket in with my findings so far.

Currently beacons.save is broken. as it relies on `beacons.list include_pillar=false` to return the beacons that are in memory and not in the pillar.

However, running beacons.list with include_pillar=False is returning just an empty beacons dict. without the in-memory beacons.

This looks like it is because event.fire is returning a blank event when include_pillar is set to False. I have not been able to find what manage_beacons is, however.

This bug also is stopping beacons.present from being able to persist beacons.

**Setup**
standard minion using 3001, and try to save a beacon, or list the beacons with include_pillar=false. Or use the following state.

```
status_beacon:
  beacon.present:
    - name: status
    - save: True
    - interval: 600
```


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Not a lot of more info in the debug log so I am skipping it here.

```
[root@salt00 log]# salt-call beacons.delete status

        Deleted beacon: status.

        True

    comment:
        Deleted beacon: beacons.

    beacons:

    comment:
        Added beacon: status.
    result:
        True
[root@salt00 log]# salt-call beacons.list

    beacons:
      status:
      - interval: 600
[root@salt00 log]# salt-call beacons.list include_pillar=False
local:
    ----------
    beacons:
        ----------
[root@salt00 log]# salt-call beacons.list
local:
    beacons:
      status:
      - interval: 600
[root@salt00 log]# salt-call beacons.save
local:
    ----------
    comment:
        Beacons saved to /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf.
    result:
        True
[root@salt00 log]# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf
beacons:
  beacons: {}
[root@salt00 log]#
```
</details>


**Expected behavior**
beacons.list works with include_pillar=False and beacons.save works, and beacons.present is able to save beacons so that they can persist.

**Additional context**
This is a regression but I haven't been able to find what regressed. I used the above beacons.present states since 2017.7 without issue.
