Probably should be an issue too:

The find_library stuff in salt/utils/rsax931.py in 2015.8 also is broken on SmartOS esky package.
Maybe other esky packages too.

I did some trussing around and it tries to load the libcrypto from /usr/lib and /lib but they don't live there on Illumos/SmartOS. Also assuming the OS provides this is kind of bad as it does not seem to be contained withing the esky packages. (Which also ships a libcrypto, which seems to be ignored).

salt/auth/pam.py also has some ctype stuff but this does not prevent salt from running (so far)

I have a stack trace here: 

```
[root@core /opt/local/salt/bin]# ./salt-run

```

I can't find the truss log, but I can recreate if anybody is interested.
