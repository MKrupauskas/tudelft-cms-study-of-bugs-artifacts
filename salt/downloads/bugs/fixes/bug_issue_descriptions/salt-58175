**Description**
On Windows, Salt uses NSSM/SSM.  NSSM/SSM creates warning 
 `AppEnvironmentExtra salt-minion` without descripton in the Windows event log.

Warnings in the Windows event log sometimes could raise concern.

The Salt-Minion otherwise works, making this a minor issue

**Setup**
Install Salt-Minion 30001 on Windows.

Open Event Viewer, search for nssm Warnings, find 

```
The description for Event ID ### from source nssm cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.

The following information was included with the event: 

AppEnvironmentExtra
salt-minion

The message resource is present but the message was not found in the message table

``` 


**Expected behavior**
- The Salt-Minion should not create warnings when it seems to work fine.
- Warnings should have a description.
