saltuil.find_job strips out any jobs with the currently running pid: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0.17/salt/modules/saltutil.py#L401

This will remove ALL jobs for a multithreaded minion as they all have the same pid.

It will also fail to clean up the proc files for any complete jobs as it will not detect that the job has completed (it checks that the pid still exists).
