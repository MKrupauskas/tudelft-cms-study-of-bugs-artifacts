### Description of Issue/Question
Team - 

When I try to do  salt pid\* state.apply icinga-setup.sls. I am getting below error - Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. You may need to run your command with `--async` in order to bypass the congested event bus. With `--async`, the CLI tool will print the job id (jid) and exit immediately without listening for responses. You can then use `salt-run jobs.lookup_jid` to look up the results of the job in the job cache later.

Please look into this ASAP.
### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

### Versions Report
