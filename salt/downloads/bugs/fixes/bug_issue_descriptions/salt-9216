Hello,

The order I have between my test and the documentation is not the same.

Here is my pillar

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/top.sls
base:
    '*':
        - core
        - override
```

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/core.sls
foo: from core
```

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/override.sls
foo: from override
```

Querying my minion show it's the first one which is taken:

```
root@salt-master:~$ salt * pillar.item foo
minion1.baby-gnu.net:
    ----------
    foo:
        from core
```

If I invert the order in `top.sls`:

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/top.sls
base:
    '*':
        - override
        - core
```

This results with the same value as before:

```
root@salt-master:~$ salt * pillar.item foo
minion1.baby-gnu.net:
    ----------
    foo:
        from core
```

I inserted a new one in the middle, just to be sure it's alphabetically ordered:

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/top.sls
base:
    '*':
        - override
        - abc
        - core
```

``` yaml
# /srv/pillar/abc.sls
foo: from abc
```

Which results with:

```
root@salt-master:~$ salt * pillar.item foo
minion1.baby-gnu.net:
    ----------
    foo:
        from abc
```

This means that the order is alphabetical, the documentation suggests either it is the last one of the list or the last one in alphabetical order (it's not clarified).

I do not know if the bug is in the documentation or in code.

Regards.
