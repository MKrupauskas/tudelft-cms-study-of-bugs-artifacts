### Description of Issue/Question
After my deep investigation, why I receiving randomly following message:
```sh 
2018-05-08 15:05:55,227 [salt.template    :62  ][ERROR   ][18028] Template was specified incorrectly: False
```
I figure out, that it happening only, when 2 or more minion hits in the reactor in the same time.
It looks like that some cache is cleared or something and not generated on the time, when second minion hit to the Reactor

```sh
salt/run/20180508150554686064/ret       {
    "_stamp": "2018-05-08T13:05:57.144721", 
    "fun": "runner.state.orchestrate", 
    "fun_args": [
        "orch.minion-onBoot", 
        {
            "pillar": {
                "event_data": {
                    "_stamp": "2018-05-08T13:05:54.546766", 
                    "cmd": "_minion_event", 
                    "data": "Minion web220c-stg-1.inet started at Tue May  8 13:05:53 2018",

                    "tag": "salt/minion/web220c-stg-1.inet/start"
                }, 
                "event_id": "web220c-stg-1.inet"
            }
        }
    ], 
    "jid": "20180508150554686064", 
    "return": {
        "data": {
            "salt01-tech.inet_master": [
                "No matching sls found for 'orch.minion-onBoot' in env 'base'"
            ]
        }, 
        "outputter": "highstate", 
        "retcode": 1
    }, 
    "success": false, 
    "user": "Reactor"
}
```

I have Auto-Scaling-Group from AWS, which deploys VM to cloud and make basic setup for minion(update master address, setup grains and start service).
After that SALT-Master make the highstate. The problem is that the Reactor works perfectly when there is only 1 new minion, but if I will deploy 2 or more new machine in the same time, then Reacotor will works only for first one which makes attempts, for others Reactor will throw error that some SLS was not found.

For me it looks like that after hit in the Reactor there is some cache clearing and not regenrated on the time.

Flow how looks like the "communication"
minion -> reactor -> orchestrate -> highstate for minion

### Setup
##### Reactor config
```sh
reactor:
  - 'salt/minion/*/start':
    - /opt/salt/salt-pillar/reactor/minion-onStart.sls
```

##### Reactor state:
```sh
log_new_minion:
  local.cmd.run:
    - name: log new minion
    - tgt: 'apps:saltmaster'
    - expr_form: grain
    - arg:
      - 'echo "[{{ data['id'] }}][minion started]  A new Minion has (re)born on $(date). Say hello to him ({{ tag }})" >> /var/log/salt/reactor.log'

hello_state:
  runner.state.orchestrate:
    - mods: orch.minion-onBoot
    - kwarg:
        pillar:
          event_data: {{ data|json }}
          event_id: {{ data['id'] }}
```

##### Orchestrate
```sh
{%- set message = "A new Minion has (re)born.\nSay *hello* to him :thinking_face:" %}
{% set service = "Reactor-NEW Minion" %}

{%- set data = salt.pillar.get("event_data") %}
{%- set id = salt.pillar.get("event_id") %}
{%- import "system/module_slack.sls" as slack %}

{% do slack.sendSlackMessage(service, None, id, message, 2) %}


boot_check_version:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: {{ data["id"] }}
    - sls: prepare.version
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create 2-3 new VM
