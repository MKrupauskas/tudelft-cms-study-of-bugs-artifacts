So I've added salt-master to my configs, and it "works" but when running a test I _always_ see this

``` yaml
          ID: salt-master
    Function: service.running
      Result: None
     Comment: Service salt-master is set to start
     Changes:
```

When I run highstate it returns 

``` yaml
          ID: salt-master
    Function: service.running
      Result: True
     Comment: Service salt-master is already enabled, and is running
     Changes:
              ----------
              salt-master:
                  True
```

What am I doing wrong!? It's driving me crazy.
