On any cloud provider when I run any salt-cloud command I get an error about a 'pyrax' module

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to import clouds pyrax, this is due most likely to a syntax error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/salt/salt/loader.py", line 931, in _load_module
    ), fn_, fpath, desc)

```

The salt-cloud commands do run to completion correctly, so it doesn't stop salt-cloud from functioning, but it's just incredibly chatty and ugly.

I've tested this on the latest 2015.2 branch

@rallytime has tested and confirmed this as well.
