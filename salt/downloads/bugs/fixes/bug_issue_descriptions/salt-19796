The fix is to append an array: `cmd.extend(['msiexec', '/i']) or simply set cmd = ['msiexec', '/i'] similar to how it was being set in 2014.7.0: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.7.0/salt/modules/win_pkg.py#L569

I'm also unable to just drop a slightly edited module into the _modules directory since I'm using a masterless minion - #14048 is rearing its head in here too.
