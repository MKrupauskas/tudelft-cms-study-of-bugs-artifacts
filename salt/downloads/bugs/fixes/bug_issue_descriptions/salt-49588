### Description of Issue/Question

When running the `network.convert_cidr` example command from the documentation, a python stack trace is thrown.

It seems the [issue is already fixed (without the author realizing there was an issue)](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/24669f79f244bb951c0eec7d958171c6268cfcbf#diff-670a7e2e3a706378b2191ed8b28f4ccf): but the fix is neither backported to [2017.7.8](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7.8/salt/modules/network.py#L1138) nor [2018.3.3](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2018.3.3/salt/modules/network.py#L1143).

### Setup

Salt installed on Ubuntu 18.04 from Ubuntu repositories.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```bash
# salt '*' network.convert_cidr 172.31.0.0/16
STR-01-RTR-001:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1493, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/modules/network.py", line 1138, in convert_cidr
        network_info = salt.ext.ipaddress.ip_network(cidr)
    AttributeError: module 'salt.ext' has no attribute 'ipaddress'
