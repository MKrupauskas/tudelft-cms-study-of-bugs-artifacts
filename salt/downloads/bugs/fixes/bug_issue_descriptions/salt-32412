`file.line` state doesn't take `show_changes` into account for new files. The parameter [`show_changes`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/eb6773823bd15188fc2592e7afaaa045572026f2/salt/states/file.py#L2653) is not used here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/eb6773823bd15188fc2592e7afaaa045572026f2/salt/states/file.py#L2721

I haven't tested this, but think this is not-so-serious bug.
