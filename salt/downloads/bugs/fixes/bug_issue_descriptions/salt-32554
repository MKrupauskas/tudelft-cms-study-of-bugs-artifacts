### Description of Issue/Question

Problem 1 : salt-cloud create EC2 instance and accept salt-minion key from no where even no salt-minion package deployed on the instance

I use salt-cloud command to create EC2 instance using my own profile 

```
sudo salt-cloud -p "new-app" mywebserver 
```

Instance successfully created, I also notice a key name of mywebserver appear inside salt-key. 
But test.ping. After ssh inside the server , I notice no salt-minion deployed on mywebserver.  

Problem 2 : saltify failed even after delete the minion-key(that don't know where it came from) from salt-key.  

```
# so I delete the key of the minion , since there is no package installed.
sudo salt-key -d mywebserver

# then I try to saltify it
sudo salt-cloud -p "saltify-my-web"  mywebserver 
```

it just show me this kinda error 

```
mywebserver:
    ----------
    Error:
        mywebserver  already exists under my-aws:ec2
```

Where my-aws:ec2 is my cloud provider . HOWEVER,  there is no such entry of mywebserver inside my cloud.profiles.d

I just issue IP address and saltify just run through without issues.
e.g. 

```
sudo salt-cloud -p "saltify-my-web"  172.16.100.22 
```
