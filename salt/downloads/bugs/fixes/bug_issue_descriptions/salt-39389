### Description of Issue/Question
A number of variables take into account the root_dir variable (pki_dir, cachedir, sock_dir, log_file, autosign_file, autoreject_file, extension_modules, key_logfile, pidfile).

ssh_log_file does not take it into account. I would have expected same behavior as log_file though.

### Setup
In /etc/salt/master, check that these values are set:

```
root_dir: /home/user/.salt
#ssh_log_file: /var/log/salt/ssh <-- this one must be commented

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Execute: `salt --config-dir /home/user/.salt/etc/salt --config-dump`

Output will be:
```
root_dir: /home/user/.salt
ssh_log_file: /var/log/salt/ssh
```

For consistency, I think that ssh_log_file should take into account root_dir
