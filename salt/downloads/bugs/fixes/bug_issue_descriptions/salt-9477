when following the tutorial... http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/cloud_controller.html using salt 0.17.4

I've tried deploying both ubuntu and centos based guests, ubuntu appears to work fine, but when a centos based guest is deployed by

```
salt-run virt.init foo 2 512 salt://centos64.img
```

the minion returns this error

<pre>

however runners.virt doesnt return an error indicating it has failed and the fuse mount  is left on the hypervisor
