### Description of Issue/Question
When trying to use vault with salt-ssh i follow the doc [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/pillar/all/salt.pillar.vault.html) 

After fixing what i assume it is one error, the the myvault / myvault_config different names (it still fails with the original names), i have this in my master:
```
$ cat conf/master 
root_dir: /tmp/
state_verbose: False
state_output: Full

file_roots:
  base:
    - srv

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - pillar

myvault:
  vault.host: 127.0.0.1
  vault.port: 8200
  vault.scheme: http  # Optional; default is https
  vault.token: 012356789abcdef  # Required, unless set in environment

ext_pillar:
  - vault: myvault path=secret/salt

```

Running config.get it works:

```
$ salt-ssh casper config.get myvault
[ERROR   ] [Errno -2] Name or service not known
[CRITICAL] Pillar render error: Failed to load ext_pillar vault: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
casper:
    ----------
    vault.host:
        127.0.0.1
    vault.port:
        8200
    vault.scheme:
        http
    vault.token:
        012356789abcdef

```

yet doing salt-ssh -l debug casper  pillar.items i get this

```
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded vault.ext_pillar
[DEBUG   ] Missing configuration file: /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Guessing ID. The id can be explicitly set in /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Found minion id from generate_minion_id(): danielleite
[DEBUG   ] Requesting URL https://None:None/v1/secret/salt using GET method
[ERROR   ] [Errno -2] Name or service not known
[CRITICAL] Pillar render error: Failed to load ext_pillar vault: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded pillar.items
```

Notice the ```None:None``` . It seems that salt-ssh is not getting the vault config
