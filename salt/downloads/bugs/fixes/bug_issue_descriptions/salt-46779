My salt-ssh setup (using the latest version from git and a virtualenv) which works in 2017.7 breaks in 2018.3 for states that have a `runas` argument.

Example output:

```
          ID: /etc/letsencrypt/acme-tiny
    Function: git.latest
        Name: https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to check remote refs: Environment could not be retrieved for User 'letsencrypt'
     Started: 20:25:48.553908
    Duration: 55.377 ms
     Changes: 
```

Some state functions give a traceback:

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/var/tmp/.salt_08831c_salt/py3/salt/modules/cmdmod.py", line 446, in _run
    ).communicate(salt.utils.stringutils.to_bytes(py_code))[0]
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
