### Description of Issue/Question

dockerng.image_present fails if there is image with `<none>` tag listed on the host.

Error message:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state dockerng.image_present for rancher/server:stable
[DEBUG   ] "GET /v1.24/images/json?only_ids=0&all=0 HTTP/1.1" 200 None

    for repo_tag in item.get('RepoTags', []):

```
### Setup

Salt state:

```
rancher_image:
  dockerng.image_present:
    - name: rancher/server:stable
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

There must be at least one image listed with `<none>` tag:

```
vagrant@master:~$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY                       TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
wordpress                        latest              1ad4ec56dc5f        18 hours ago        422.3 MB
wordpress                        <none>              c7441ac916f3        6 days ago          421.6 MB
```

Removing image manually fixes the issue.
