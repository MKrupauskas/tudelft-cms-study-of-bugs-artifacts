### Description of Issue/Question

from minion log:

```
2017-02-06 13:41:40,160 [salt.state                                           ][ERROR   ][18831] {'homephone':  ,,,,Helmke-Soil Science,,262-0397,,,,,Helmke-Soil Science'}
```

Why not just let us pass the whole geocs field through as is instead of trying to be smart? Different systems interpret gecos feld differently (these accounts originated from IRIX) and linux's `useadd` that you're passing this to has only one `-c comment` switch: not the "fullname", "workphone", etc. `states.user.present` wants. 

What's worse is that gecos field in the input is actually
```
Xiaodun He,,262-0397,,,,,Helmke-Soil Science
```
so it's the salt that's duplicating `Helmke-Soil Science` up there.

Could you please add a `gecos` parameter to `present()`/`changes()` and if it's not `None`: bypass this whole non-portable "fullname"/"homephone"/whatever mess?

(The above gecos, BTW, should as per wikipedia be parsed as
  - fullname: Xiaodun He
  - contact person/address: None
  - workphone: 262-0397
  - homephone: None
  - other info: ",,,Helmke-Soil Science"

Reading -- or at least logging -- the whole thing as "homephone" is just plain broken no matter how you look at it.)
