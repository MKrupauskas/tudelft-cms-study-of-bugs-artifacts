I'm in the process of upgrading from 0.16.4 to 2014.1.1 and noticed a change in behavior. If an `onlyif` condition on `cmd.run fails`, it's logged with ERROR severity. In the 0.16.x series it was not logged this way. This is confusing as it's not indicative of an error in any way. I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out what was "failing" when in reality the `onlyif` clause was working as intended.

It looks to me like if you pass `ignore_retcode=True` to all the various `cmd.retcode()` calls in `_run_check()`, it would bypass the code that forces the log level up to ERROR. A message would still be logged at INFO and DEBUG, though, if the user wants that information. I can submit a pull request if there is interest on your side in changing this.
