### Description of Issue/Question
Docstrings in the salt test cases place the first line of the docstring on the line after the opening quotes. The shortDescription method in the python unittest library's TestCase class returns the first line of the docstring, where the first line of the docstring is the line with the opening quotes. So shortDescription returns nothing for all the salt test cases.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
From what I can tell, this issue does not show up when running the salt test suite as-is. I had made some changes to the test suite output so it would include the shortDescription, which is how I encountered the problem.

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
