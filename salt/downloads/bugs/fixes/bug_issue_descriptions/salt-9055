Right now it won't write a file at all if the file doesn't exist and you don't force it. If the file exists or you pass force, you get caught with a stack trace and your pants down because fopen doesn't have the 'w' parameter. :)

I'm guessing that the if check at:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/wheel/key.py#L103
is supposed to be `if os...` and not `if not os...`
And a couple of lines below you need to pass in 'w' into fopen for the write to work. :)
I'll send a pull request soon(tm), just need to grab the repository.
