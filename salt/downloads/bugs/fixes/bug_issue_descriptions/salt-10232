I'm running a deployment orchestration/metadata service on top of salt, using ssh'ing into minions and invoking salt-call locally. When executing on 30 hosts concurrently, I'm seeing high numbers of SaltClientErrors with the following stack trace:

An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

    self.opts.get('_safe_auth', True)

    raise SaltClientError
SaltClientError

The kwarg timeout default for sign_in is 60s, so it's hard to imagine a legitimate situation in which auth is actually taking this long.
