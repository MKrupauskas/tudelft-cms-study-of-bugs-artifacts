### Description of Issue/Question
It's not possible to create/delete/change zfs filesystems if the filesystem name or the mount point include spaces.

### Setup

```
something:
  zfs.filesystem_present:
    - name: pool/Foo Bar
    - properties:
        mountpoint: /Foo Bar
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Setup state as outline above for a minion supporting zfs. The state will fail: 
`stderr:` cannot open 'pool/Foo Bar': dataset does not exist
