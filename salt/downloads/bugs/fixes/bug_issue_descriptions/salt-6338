If the password for a rabbitmq_user contains the characters '$$', proper shell escaping is not occurring and $$ is replaced by the shell with the PID of the current process. For example, the password 'wh$$' may become 'wh22456'. rabbitmqctl is actually performing that substitution but salt is preventing us from properly escaping the $$ combination.

Steps to reproduce -
- add to config --
  my_user:
  rabbitmq_user.present:
  - password: fancypa$$
  - force: True
  - runas: root
- execute the salt state.
- observe that rabbitmqctl is called
- try to log in with specified password (failure)

We have tried quoting with ' and '" but salt removes those when executing rabbitmqctl.

We have tried escaping the quotes but they end up double-escaped (i.e. \\'fancypa$$\\', ending up, presumable, with literal ' as part of the password and PID as well

We have tried escaping the $$ but salt further escapes the escapes (i.e. fancypa\$\$ becomes fancypa\\$\\$).

We've tried all combinations of the above both directly in the state definition and in a pillar definition to no avail.

The correct invocation of rabbitmqctl that works is --
    rabbitmqctl change_password my_user 'fancypa\$\$'

We don't see how we can get salt to achieve this construct.
