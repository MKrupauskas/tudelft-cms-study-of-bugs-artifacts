### Description of Issue/Question
If no ACL is specified in the zookeeper.present state (because we don't need to enforce any ACLs), ACL settings should be ignored and only values checked. However, if Test=True is specified when running the state, it shows the changes, that are going to be made, even though the difference is just in the ACLs, not the values. 
Empty ACLs were allowed by this PR https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/46043, but this does not work for the Test mode. Also, the change was not fully correct, because the message still says 

### Setup
**connection_strings.sls**
```
conn_str_mongodb:
  zookeeper.present:
    - name: /site/connectionstrings/mongodb
    - value: "mongodb://admin:password@mongo1/database"
    - makepath: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running the state with Test=True outputs the following:
```
          ID: conn_str_mongodb
    Function: zookeeper.present
        Name: /site/connectionstrings/mongodb
      Result: None
     Comment: Znode /site/connectionstrings/mongodb is will be updated
     Started: 07:49:39.498238
    Duration: 16.733 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              new:
                  ----------
                  acls:
              old:
                  ----------
                  acls:
                      |_
                        - 31
                        |_
                          - world
                          - anyone
```
Running the state in normal mode (not Testing) with the same znode already available in the zookeeper cluster, output is the following:
```
          ID: conn_str_mongodb
    Function: zookeeper.present
        Name: /site/connectionstrings/mongodb
      Result: True
     Comment: Znode /site/connectionstrings/mongodb successfully updated
     Started: 07:55:13.788249
    Duration: 18.059 ms
     Changes:
```
As you can see, the values were identical and no changes are shown, but the message is confusing (it says znode was updated), but it was not updated. This should be fixed as well. Having empty ACL settings should just ignore ACL and compare just the values.
