## Problem

If global `state_aggregate: True`, even if some `pkg.installed` states explicitly specify `aggregate: False`, they still get aggregated.
## Reproducible setup

Use Salt minion-only setup with `salt-call` command for simplicity.
- Minion configuration:
  
  ```
  > cat /etc/salt/minion
  state_aggregate: True
  ```
- Installation of package inside default OS repository:
  
  ```
  > cat /srv/salt/package_inside_yum.sls
  package_inside:
      pkg.installed:
          - name: vim-enhanced
  ```
- Installation of package outside default OS repository:
  
  ```
  > cat /srv/salt/package_outside_yum.sls
  package_outside:
      pkg.installed:
          - name: whatever
          - aggregate: False
  ```
- States top file:
  
  ```
  > cat /srv/salt/top.sls
  base:
      '*':
          - package_inside_yum
          - package_outside_yum
  ```
- No pillar files at all.
## Real problem

Note how "innocent" state `package_inside` in the following output failed due to missing package `whatever` _which has nothing to do with this state_. Move over, state `package_outside` (where `whatever` is referenced) explicitly states `aggregate: False`.

This is a real life problem when non-aggregate-able packages (with `aggregate: False`) must not be tried for installation before additional YUM repositories are configured. Instead, they are prohibitively tried ahead of YUM repository configuration and cause chain of "innocent" states failures only because one of them simply triggers the aggregation.

For example, `git` package on RHEL5 is not available in default OS repository and EPEL YUM configuration should be done first.

Executing `highstate` for the setup above:

```
salt-call --local state.highstate
... # see logs separately below

## Detailed output

The output below was captured with either/or:
- (A) global `state_aggregate: True`
- (B) global `state_aggregate: False`

Note that the output (B) `state_aggregate: False` is the expected results when `aggregate: False` for individual `pkg.installed` state is actually taken into account
#### `state_aggregate: True`
