### file.managed and archive.extracted don't properly work for tgz remote files
### Setup

```
/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_tmp_tar_.tgz:
  file.managed:
    - source: http://downloads.ghostscript.com/public/binaries/ghostscript-9.18-linux-x86_64.tgz
    - source_hash: md5=e09812828784c102cd523cfaef42f250
    - makedirs: True
```

The code above always fails complaining about md5 hash though it actually appears to be correct. This is because the Tornado framework used by default as a backend has `decompress_response=True` turned on, so in the end you'll have a decompressed tar archive instead of tar gzip once a file is downloaded and passed further to validate its hash.
My vile hack was to hardcode `decompress_response=False` as an extra argument in `/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/utils/http.py:470` on my system.
It would be nice to be able to customize things such as backend and/or its options but using decompress_response=False by default is probably ok too in this case.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create a state file with the content mentioned in the Setup section and run it.
