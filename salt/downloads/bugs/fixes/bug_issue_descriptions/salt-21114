This is probably related to/a duplicate of the already closed issue #8912. Sorry for duplicating this, but apparently my initial comment on the closed issue got overlooked...

The above mentioned issue is still present in the current _develop_ branch. To emphasize this using the example given by smithjm:

```
- roles:
  - service_tenant:
    - admin_role
    - user_role
  - admin_tenant:
    - admin_role
```

The roles are correctly set for _service_tenant_, but the _admin_tenant_ gets completely ignored.

I suspect that there is something wrong with the tenant loop in the code (without having much programming knowledge that is, so i might be completely and utterly wrong too...). Line 176 states:

```
for tenant_role in roles[0]:
```

The **[0]** looks to me like it's somehow disabling the loop altogether and only processing the first list element...

Furthermore, the state doesn't seem to support the removal of roles. If i modify the state (after applying the original one) to read:

```
- roles:
  - service_tenant:
    - admin_role
  - admin_tenant:
    - admin_role
```

The role _user_role_ doesn't get removed in service_tenant (while the admin_tenant still gets completely ignored)...
