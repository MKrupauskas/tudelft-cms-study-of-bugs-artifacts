Using salt-ssh 0.17.2 to get a minion installed on Ubuntu 13.10. The following state declaration (which worked for me with earlier Salt/Ubuntu versions) fails:

```
salt-minion:                          
    pkgrepo:
        - managed
        - ppa: saltstack/salt
```

Output:

```
pkgrepo_|-salt-minion_|-salt-minion_|-managed:
    ----------
    __run_num__:
        3
    changes:
        ----------

    result:

```

Strangely enough, the following states still ran, and apparently the `salt-minion` package was installed successfully. I don't know if this is connected to the recent `pkgrepo` problem. I installed `salt-ssh` 0.17.2 using Salt bootstrap.
