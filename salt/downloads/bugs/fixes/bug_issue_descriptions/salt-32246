### Salt minions bootstrapped by salt-cloud are raising this warning every time they are restarted.
### Setup

The minions are running on AWS EC2, all bootstrapped by salt-cloud. So looks like salt-cloud is setting hash_type: md5 as default. If that is the case, please change its default to SHA256.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Just restart the minion and the warning in the subject will be raised.
### Versions Report

All minions are running the very same version
