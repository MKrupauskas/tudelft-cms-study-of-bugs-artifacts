In an attempt to eliminate redundancies in my Pillar files, I've tried to use nested includes: SLS A includes SLS B, which in turn includes SLS C (along with some `defaults`). I can't get this to work though, getting strange rendering errors no matter what I try. Removing the nested level of includes solves the problem.
