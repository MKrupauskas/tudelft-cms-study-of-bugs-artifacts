### Description of Issue/Question
The `file.stat` execution function does return file permissions properly under Python 3.
Under Python 2, the `mode` item would be all numbers, such as `0660`.
Under Python 3, the `mode` item is prefixed with `0o`, such as `0o660`

This would seem to be due to a change in the `oct()` built-in function between Python 2 and 3:

https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#oct
Convert an integer number (of any size) to an octal string.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#oct
Convert an integer number to an octal string prefixed with “0o”.

This is causing dependent modules, such as `states.file` to fail. #52173
