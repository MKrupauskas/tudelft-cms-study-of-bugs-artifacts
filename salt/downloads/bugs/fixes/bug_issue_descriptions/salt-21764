## Specific Problem

Just run this command with any arbitrary job id:

```
> salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 0123456789
> echo $?
0
```

For scripting purposes it is much more helpful if command returns non-zero error code for non-existing job results.
## General non-zero return code problem

I believe this is not a bug specific to `jobs.lookup_jid`.
Issue #18510 is linked to many similar cases and looks directly related.

However, searching issues for "zero" results in many related cases all related to return/exit error codes.
