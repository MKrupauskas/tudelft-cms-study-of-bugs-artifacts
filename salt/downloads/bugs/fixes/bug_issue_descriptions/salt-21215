Hello 
I recently updated salt from salt-2014.7.0-3 to salt-2014.7.1-1 after that mount state is failed to finish

Centos 6.5 OpenVZ container 

State: 

```
mount_/vol:
    mount.mounted:
        - device: x.x.x.x:/vol/
        - fstype: nfs
        - mkmnt: True
        - name: /mnt/vol
        - opts:
            - ro,nosuid,noatime,nolock,nointr,timeo=14,nfsvers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,auto,soft,nocto,acregmin=5,acregmax=60,acdirmin=60,acdirmax=90,tcp
```

```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1529, in call
