### Description of Issue/Question

There are several deprecation warnings in the glance execution module. Most of them seem to revolve around comments like:

```
# I may want to use this code on Beryllium
# until we got Boron packages for Ubuntu
# so please keep this code until Carbon!
```

Or other pieces are looking at moving away from the v1 to the v2 API for glance. 

@0xf10e - These were all of your changes, and this module is largely maintained by you. Can you take a look at these deprecation warnings and comments and let me know what you'd like to do with them?

I have seen some PRs where you have bumped the version (or even my name is on the git blame for some of the warnings), from one feature (Boron) to the next (Carbon). I wanted to check in with you before ripping this all out, since the `develop` branch is currently in the `Carbon` release code-name, and we're preparing for the next feature release and I am going through all of the code marked for removal in `Carbon`.
