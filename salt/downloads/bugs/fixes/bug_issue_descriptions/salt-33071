archive.extracted won't extract specified .tar file to existing directories. Will only extract to a directory that does not exist on the file system.

Expecting that the file will get extracted to the directory specified even if the folder and the contents of the .tar already exist on the system.

This state won't extract the specified file. Get a message that `/opt/` already exists:

```
fetch foo source: 
  archive.extracted: 
    - name: /opt/ 
    - archive_format: tar 
    - tar_options: v 
    - source: https://path/to/my/foo.tar.gz 
    - source_hash: md5=XXXX 
    - user: root 
    - group: root
```

This state will extract the file because the `/Test` directory does not exist on the system at the time the state is run. Any subsequent runs of this same state will result in a `/Test/` already exists message.

```
fetch foo source: 
  archive.extracted: 
    - name: /Test 
    - archive_format: tar 
    - tar_options: v 
    - source: https://path/to/my/foo.tar.gz 
    - source_hash: md5=XXXX 
    - user: root 
    - group: root
```

```
