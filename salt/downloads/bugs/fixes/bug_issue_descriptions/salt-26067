Here is a re-post of the info embedded in #25961 , as requested by @UtahDave 

@twangboy @UtahDave ok, I think the **SSL setup/config** on _**repo.saltstack.com**_  **needs some further tweaking**.

wget reports:

```
wget -v -m -r -l 1 -i new-salt-minion-files.txt 1>/dev/null 
--2015-08-05 20:52:28--  https://repo.saltstack.com/windows/

GnuTLS: received alert [112]: The server name sent was not recognized
ERROR: The certificate of ‘repo.saltstack.com’ is not trusted.
ERROR: The certificate of ‘repo.saltstack.com’ hasn't got a known issuer.
```

I think the `wget` errors are caused by the fact that the server's certificate chain is incomplete, the issuer part is missing so the trust path is not complete. 

And SSL Labs testing only gives it a poor `'C'` rating.

by comparison the old wordpress site achieved a `'A-'`

Here are the full archives of the current status of the SSL config & setup:

I still have not done any testing using the windows winrepo python 2.7.8, as yet.
