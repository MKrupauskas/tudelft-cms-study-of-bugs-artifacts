running salt minion 2015.5.2 in masterless mode on Windows 7 and using the winrepo state (specifically the state, not the module) doesn't run anything.  Repro:
top.sls

``` yaml
base:
  '*':
    - config
```

config.sls

``` yaml
winrepo:
  winrepo.genrepo
```

command: `salt-call --local state.highstate`

output:

If I run this: salt-call --local winrepo.genrepo  then it works exactly as expected.  I've verified that my repo is set up correctly and that everything else works fine.

It looks like this state is only loaded if it's running on the salt master, however I see no reason why it shouldn't be able to run on a minion if the minion is running masterless.
