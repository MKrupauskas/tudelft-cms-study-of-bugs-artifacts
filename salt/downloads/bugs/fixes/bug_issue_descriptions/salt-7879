I have several states that look like this:

```
eset-import-license:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/opt/eset/esets/license/esets_nod32.lic
    - source: salt://eset/{{ pillar['eset_lic'] }}?env={{ pillar['lic_env'] }}
```

Those states have been working fine for several months.

Now that I put 0.17.0 on my Ubuntu hosts, those states do not recognize the ?env=<my env> part of the source definition.

However, it does work if I move the ?env to it's own parameter.
Like this:

```
eset-import-license:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/opt/eset/esets/license/esets_nod32.lic
    - source: salt://eset/{{ pillar['eset_lic'] }}
    - env: {{ pillar['lic_env'] }}
```

Since, I can change my states to make them work, this isn't a huge deal. But, I'd like to know if the ?env= style of defining an alternate environment for files has gone away, or if this is a bug?

Thanks,
Nick
