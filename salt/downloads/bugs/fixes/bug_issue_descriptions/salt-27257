I have the similar issue such as  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/5517  but for centos linux.
Running `state.highstate test=True` or individual state execution reports changes 
(`Result: Differs`) when no changes are needed.

The issue appears when  `- comments` section is set in a state file.

state:

```
nginx-repo:                                                                        
  pkgrepo:                                                                           
    - managed                                                                        
    - name: nginx
    - humanname: Nginx.org Repository                                                  
    - baseurl: http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/
    - gpgcheck: 0                                                                    
    - comments:                                                                      
      - 'priority=1'                                                                    
```

output of the first run:

```
# salt-ssh -i vbox_srv1c7 state.sls yumrepos.nginx 
vbox_srv1c7:
  Name: nginx - Function: pkgrepo.managed - Result: Changed

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1

```

output of the second run (with wrong behavior):

```
vbox_srv1c7:
  Name: nginx - Function: pkgrepo.managed - Result: Differs

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1 (unchanged=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1

```

finally just to show that repo-file was deployed successfully :

```
# salt-ssh -i vbox_srv1c7 -r 'cat /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo'
vbox_srv1c7:
    ----------
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
    stdout:
        root@10.10.10.15's password: 

        [nginx]
        gpgcheck=0
        humanname=Nginx.org Repository
        baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/
        name=Nginx.org Repository
        priority=1

```
