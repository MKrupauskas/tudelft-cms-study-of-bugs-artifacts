### Description of Issue/Question
I am trying to run a state.apply to install some packages on a minion running Manjaro Linux (Arch based) but it errors out when I run things that contain pkg.installed in the state.


### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

 I setup a simple state as an example:
```
tools:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - tmux
      - git
      - vagrant
```
But I receive this error when applying the state

```
vmbox:
----------
          ID: tools
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'pkg.meta.vmbox'
              Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False
     Changes:   
```
My guess is that since it is being detected a Manjaro and not Arch, it does not know to use pacman. I tried to use this page https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/providers.html to force it to use pacman but I had no luck.

```
tools:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - tmux
      - git
      - vagrant
  provider: pacman
```
