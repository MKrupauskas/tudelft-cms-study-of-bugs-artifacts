### Instance cannot be properly created and bootstrapped

Since https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/vultrpy.py doesn't support even SSH keys specification, it's basically impossible to provision a new instance. `salt-cloud` after a number of SSH login failures reaches

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to start Salt on host <MINION>
```

Here are the current parameters for `/v1/server/create`

```
