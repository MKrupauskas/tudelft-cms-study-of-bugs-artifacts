Hi, I have a weird issue with salt-ssh where it hangs some Amazon Linux instances. On some machines I have to disable requiretty and then it works, on others requiretty is present (I also have the option set to true in the roster file).

I am stuck on a couple of instances where I get no response from this command

```
    sudo salt-ssh '*' test.ping
```

I get some debug with lots of output and the last lines are:

```
    > done
    WARNING: Unable to locate current thin version.

    deploy
```

My salt version are:

```
Salt: 2014.7.0rc5
Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
Jinja2: 2.7.3

PyYAML: 3.10
ioflo: Not Installed
PyZMQ: 14.3.1
RAET: Not Installed
ZMQ: 4.0.4

```

What should I do to debug this further?
