### Description of Issue/Question

incron.present failing as non-root user
### Setup

```
watch ap imports directory:
    incron.present:
        - user: myuser
        - path: /share/wires/incoming/
        - mask:
            - IN_CREATE
            - IN_MOVED_TO
        - cmd: '/usr/local/bin/ap_import_new $@$#'
        - require:
            - file: /etc/incron.allow
            - service: incron
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

We recently upgraded from an older version (maybe 2015.5.2). This was working fine before the upgrade.
