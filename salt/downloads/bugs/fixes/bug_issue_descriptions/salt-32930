I recently switched to using RAET because of continued issues I'm having with salt.. hoping that it would alleviate some of the pain I'm having. I am seeing highstates run _really_ slow and I see the following error.

```
# salt-call state.highstate
[INFO    ] Got list of available master addresses: ['smaster1-xxx.xxxxx.com', 'smaster2-xxx.xxxxx.com']
[ERROR   ] Future exception was never retrieved: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 282, in wrapper
    yielded = next(result)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 476, in eval_master
    pub_channel = salt.transport.client.AsyncPubChannel.factory(opts, **factory_kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/transport/client.py", line 157, in factory
    return salt.transport.raet.AsyncRAETPubChannel(opts, **kwargs)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'AsyncRAETPubChannel'
[INFO    ] Determining pillar cache
```
### Setup

My minion config is:

```
hash_type: sha256
random_reauth_delay: 10
master:
  - smaster1-xxx.xxxxx.com
  - smaster2-xxx.xxxxx.com
master_type: failover
master_shuffle: True
master_alive_interval: 60
auth_timeout: 10
auth_tries: 0
retry_dns: 0
transport: raet
startup_states: highstate
```

My master config looks like:

```
keep_jobs: 1
open_mode: True
timeout: 30
transport: raet

file_roots:
  base:
    - /etc/salt/git/salt
    - /etc/salt/git/salt/states

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /etc/salt/git/salt/pillar
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use the RAET transport and run a highstate command.
