Hi all.  Thanks for trying to make CPAN work with salt!  Those of us who still toil in the perl mines appreciate that you haven't all forgotten us.

I've got a Centos 6 server and the version of cpan does not support the '-J' or -j' (and possibly other) arguments.  This means cpan.installed fails every time.  cpan.installed calls show_config to determine if the build dirs are there or not.

Centos 7 is the current release, so Centos 6 is not very old.

To configure cpan (not cpanm) I just did a file.managed on /root/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm.

One awkward result of configuring cpan in a state and then installing modules with an execution module is that I don't seem to be able to ensure the config is in place before I execute cpan.installed.  

Also, you might be better served by cpanm than cpan.  It's more oriented toward one-line installs.

Hope that helps
-Dylan
