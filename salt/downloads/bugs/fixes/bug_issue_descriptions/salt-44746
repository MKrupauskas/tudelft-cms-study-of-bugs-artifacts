### Description of Issue/Question
In the archive state, the `source_hash_update` option does not work with local file sources (eg. /tmp/file.zip). I think this is the defined behavior (although I can't find where I read that now), but I'm wondering if it should be. My use case is the following. I store some archives on an NFS volume with hashes and extract them to an instance-local volume. When I update the archives I'd like for them to be extracted.

It seems like the root of the issue is that local sources are not cached by the minion, so when we try to get the checksum of the cached file for comparison, we get None. 

This isn't a huge issue for me. My workaround is to extract it always using `overwrite` which doesn't even make me cringe that much :)

### Setup
```
$ ll /mnt/test
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   4000065 Nov 28 16:10 config.zip
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root      2390 Nov 28 16:32 hashes
```
```
extract_config:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /tmp/test
    - source: /mnt/test/config.zip
    - source_hash: file:///mnt/test/hashes
    - source_hash_update: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. run the state to extract the config
2. modify the hash and run the state again
