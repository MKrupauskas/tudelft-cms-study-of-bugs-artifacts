Starting nginx on minion and modifying nginx.conf - adding erroneous directive, so `nginx -t` returns error and non-zero exit code. Running a highstate:

test.sls
```yaml
nginx-conf-check:
  cmd.run:
    - name: nginx -t
    - prereq:
      - service: nginx-service

nginx-service:
  service.running:
    - name: nginx
    - enable: True

include:
  - .test2
```

test2.sls
```yaml
emulate-changes:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo 'changed=true'
    - stateful: True
    - watch_in:
      - service: nginx-service
```

```

Checking process list - nginx is absent. Why did `nginx-service` state start ? Why `nginx-conf-check` state was not started ?
Trying the **same** with single sls file:

```yaml
nginx-conf-check:
  cmd.run:
    - name: nginx -t
    - prereq:
      - service: nginx-service

nginx-service:
  service.running:
    - name: nginx
    - enable: True

emulate-changes:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo 'changed=true'
    - stateful: True
    - watch_in:
      - service: nginx-service
```

Running a highstate:

```
# salt --state-verbose=true --state-output=full 'minion' state.highstate
minion:
----------  
          ID: emulate-changes
    Function: cmd.run
        Name: echo 'changed=true'

```

Now we see a proper behavior: check state was started, nginx was not restarted, it is still present in process list.
It seems something is wrong in processing includes by salt.


P.S. Why do we see
```
stdout:
                  changed=tru
```
in salt output ? Where is the last letter (tru**E**) ?
