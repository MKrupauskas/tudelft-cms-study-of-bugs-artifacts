**Description**

I am attempting to install the 32-bit zabbix-agent package provided from the saltstack windows repository. The state running the install is shown in the setup section.

When I run the state, the output from the state suggests that the package installed but returns a Result of False.  A check of the computer that the state is running on shows the agent to have been installed properly as well. As can be seen in the image below, the state installed Zabbix successfully and started the service.

I did see a previous bug report about a repo failing (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/48682), but this appears to be a separate issue (I'm not using a private repo).

**Setup**

Create an SLS file with the following yaml

```
Zabbix Agent (32-bit):
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - zabbix-agent: 'latest'
```


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Run the state provided above on a windows 32-bit minion. The output should look similar to the following.

```
test_machine:
----------
          ID: Zabbix Agent (32-bit)
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: zabbix-agent
     Started: 11:24:20.439861
    Duration: 61300.605 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              Zabbix Agent (32-bit):
                  ----------
                  new:
                      5.2.3.2400
                  old:
              zabbix-agent:
                  ----------
                  install status:
                      success
```

**Expected behavior**

The return value should be True. The package has installed properly and the service is running.

**Versions Report**

I wasn't sure how to get the salt version report off of the minion. I did check the minion version, which is also salt 3003.

**Additional Information**

Despite the package being installed, attempting to uninstall it with salt afterwords also fails

```
salt 'test_machine pkg.remove zabbix-agent
test_machine:
    ----------
    zabbix-agent:
        ----------
        current:
            not installed
```
