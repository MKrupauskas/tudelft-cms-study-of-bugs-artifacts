### Description of Issue/Question

I am receiving a minion timeout error when using the `win_wua` execution module when the job takes a long time to complete. The command completes, as I tested it using `salt-call --local` and eventually increasing my timeout to `1000`, but I would expect to not have to increase my timeout this high to see the results. This is related to #34868 
### Setup
1. (1) windows minion and linux master
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. `salt 'win*' win_wua.install_update ff0aeb4c-337a-467d-bcd5-02840076f371` or `salt win* win_wua.list_updates`

```
  ch3ll@localhost  /etc/salt  sudo salt 'win*' win_wua.install_update ff0aeb4c-337a-467d-bcd5-02840076f371
win2012:
    Minion did not return. [Not connected]
