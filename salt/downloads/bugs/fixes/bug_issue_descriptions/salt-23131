Hi all,

It would be very useful to have the same format in `jobs.list_jobs` for all returners. Under version 2014.7.5 the output of `jobs.list_jobs` with a local job-cache looks like this:

```
[root@salt salt]# salt-run jobs.list_jobs
20150428110219511091:
----------
Arguments:
    - fuba.projects.project
Function:
    state.sls
StartTime:
    2015, Apr 28 11:02:19.511091
Target:
    fuba-lamp-dev-01.office.com
Target-type:
    glob
User:
    root
```

and the output with Redis or MySQL as returner just shows the JIDs:

```
[root@salt salt]# salt-run jobs.list_jobs
- 20150428145221306767
- 20150428145715408562
```

One can see that the output with the local cache is much more useful.

Cheers
