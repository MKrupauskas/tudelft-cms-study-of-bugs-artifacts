### Description of Issue/Question
file.line after does not add the "content" text if the beginning of the content text to be inserted matches a line preceding the "after" line. My theory is the issue is an improper regex match of text, not taking into account whitespace

### Setup
SLS File:
```
/tmp/filetest:
  file.line:
    - after: "# This is a comment"
    - mode: ensure
    - content: "some  new  text"
```
/tmp/filetest contents:
```
# This is a comment
some  text  with  spaces

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running the state returns "No changes needed to be made". Removing whitespace from the file.line "content" portion will properly add the text. Example of the removed whitespace SLS that works properly:
```
/tmp/filetest:
  file.line:
    - after: "# This is a comment"
    - mode: ensure
    - content: "somenew  text"
```
