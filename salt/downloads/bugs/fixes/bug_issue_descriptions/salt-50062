### Description of Issue/Question
[max_event_size](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#max-event-size) Does not always trim long events. 

If the event has a `key:value` pair where the value is a dict and not a string than the `dict_trim` will run `sys.getsizeof` on the dict. This returned size is much lower than the issue size even in cases where it shouldn't be. 

However just serializing that dict and running the trim on it also doesn't seem like the right answer as that could be trimming important information used for parsing the event data. 

I'm not sure what the correct course is for this. But I can see this causing headaches for very large state runs. 


### Setup
Reducing this down to a more simple test can be done with the following.

create 2 largeish random files and convert them to base64 so that we don't trigger diff binary mode. 
`for i in 1 2; do dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/testfile bs=512 count=10000; base64 /tmp/testfile > /srv/salt/testfile.${i}; rm -f /tmp/testfile; done`

then alternate between these 2 states. 

```
test1:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/testfile
    - source: salt://testfile.1

test2:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/testfile
    - source: salt://testfile.2
```
This will create a huge return dict inside the return data. which will get sent back to the master as an job event will not be trimmed by dict_trim.

although dict_trim really hasn't changed since 2016 so this should happen in all versions since then.
