master version :  Salt 2015.8.3
minion version :  Salt-Minion 2015.8.5-AMD64
i try to input salt command on master like this:  
`salt 'win-minion-id' cmd.shell 'echo ' shell='powershell'`
note:
'win-minion-id' is a minion for windows;
'' is some chinese character;

but the result like this : 

```
win-minion-id: 
    ??
```

all chinese character be cast to sign '?'

If i'm try to run same command "echo " on powershell's window on minion's locally, I can get a  normal output ''. and i can input and output any chinese character on powershell's window on minion's locally

It's not happend on salt-minion for linux.

Is there anything settings I didn't notice?
