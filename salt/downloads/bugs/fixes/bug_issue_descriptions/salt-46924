### Description of Issue

I implemented a custom roster module. After changing the module, `salt-ssh` executes the stale `.pyc` file from the `__pycache__` directory, instead of the the changed `.py` file.


### Setup

Dummy roster implementation `stale.py`:

```
from __future__ import print_function

def targets(tgt, tgt_type='glob', **kwargs):
    print(__file__)
    return {}
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Create custom roster `/tmp/ext/roster/stale.py` and add `/tmp/ext` to `module_dirs` in master configuration.

2. Execute `salt-ssh '*' test.ping --roster=stale`, output:
   ```
   /tmp/ext/roster/stale.py
   [ERROR   ] No matching targets found in roster.
   ```

3. Change roster module, e.g. insert `print('file was changed')`
4. Execute `salt-ssh '*' test.ping --roster=stale`, **change in module is not refelected**. Output:
   ```
   /tmp/ext/roster/__pycache__/stale.cpython-35.pyc
   [ERROR   ] No matching targets found in roster.
   ```

5. Remove `__pycache__`: `rm -rfv /tmp/ext/roster/__pycache__`
4. Execute `salt-ssh '*' test.ping --roster=stale`, output:
   ````
   file was changed
   /tmp/ext/roster/stale.py
   [ERROR   ] No matching targets found in roster.
   ````

### Workaround ###

Delete the `__pycache__` directory and create a `__pycache__` file (!) in the roster directory instead. Generally speaking, create a condition that prevents the executing Python process from creating the `__pycache__` directory permanently.
