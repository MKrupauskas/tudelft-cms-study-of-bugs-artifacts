### Description of Issue/Question

In version 2018.3.0 When running states that use the win_servermanager to install windows features I am getting a ValueError that states Named Version 'Flourine' is not known - the o and u in Fluorine are swapped and I suspect this is triggering the error.

### Setup

Here is from a state that worked previously

    Function: win_servermanager.installed
        Name: Web-Common-HTTP
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

                File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\loader.py", line 1823, in wrapper
