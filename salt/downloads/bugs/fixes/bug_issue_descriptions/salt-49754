### Description of Issue/Question
salt.minion mishandles the opts['master'] when constructing a master_uri for zeromq to connect to the master returner port when the master is provided in the minion config as an IPv6 address.

zmq requires the master_uri to be in the format `tcp://[::1]:4506` but salt tries to use zmq with something like `tcp://::1:4506` which is not valid, and will quietly fail to connect with no indication the URI is invalid.

### Setup
The simplest way to reproduce this is to configure salt master to listen on IPv6 `[::]`, and the minion to connect to the master via IPv6, on the same host, via IPv6 localhost address `[::1]`

/etc/salt/master excerpt:
```
interface: '::'
ipv6: True
```
(re)start the salt master and verify this is working using `sudo lsof -i tcp:4506` and/or `nc -6 -z ::1 4506`

/etc/salt/minion excerpt:
```
master: '::1'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt-call --log-level=debug test.ping`
