I'm trying to use salt to script my infrastructure package upgrades. I have a script that does:

```
  for full_ret in self.local.cmd_cli(l, job, expr_form='list', timeout=timeout, **job_args):
    results.update(full_ret)
```

When I use this piece of code with job='pkg.upgrade' against my Debian VMs, I frequently end up with the results dictionary not having any values added to it. This is despite my efforts to calculate a suitable timeout earlier in the script.

Looking at the salt/modules/aptpkg.py it's clear that the `**kwargs` it accepts is not used in the cmd.run call it does.

Perhaps the kwargs should be passed to the cmd.run, or it should be removed from the arguments to aptpkg.upgrade.
