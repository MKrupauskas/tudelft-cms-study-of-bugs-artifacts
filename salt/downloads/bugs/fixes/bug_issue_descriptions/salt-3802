I have a very simple config to enable unattended upgrades for Debian/Ubuntu machines:

``` yaml
security: 
  debconf.set: 
  - name: unattended-upgrades 
  - data: 
        'unattended-upgrades/enable_auto_updates': {'type': ' boolean', 'value':  True} 
  cmd.run: 
  - name: dpkg-reconfigure -fnoninteractive unattended-upgrades 
  - watch: 
    - debconf: unattended-upgrades 
  pkg.installed: 
  - name: unattended-upgrades 
```

When I run salt the state is applied correctly:

```
    State: - debconf
    Name:      unattended-upgrades
    Function:  set
        Result:    True
        Comment:   
        Changes:   unattended-upgrades/enable_auto_updates: True
```

However when I run highstate a second (or third, fourth, etc.) time it keeps changing the state every time. Checking the current setting manually shows it being set correctly:

```
root@services:~# debconf-get-selections | grep unattended-upgrades
unattended-upgrades unattended-upgrades/enable_auto_updates boolean True
```

Not having looked at the source I can think of two possible problems:
- the spelling of the boolean value is incorrect: debconf uses the lowercase `true` and `false` instead of `True` and `False`. Perhaps that is causing confusion.
- the state does not correctly test the current setting.
