i'm using the file backup feature and just noticed, that files copied there lose their permission.
while this may be problematic it also creates an information leak of possibly security sensitive configuration information, as the backup files are created world-readable and the file_backup-base-directory is also world-readable.

i understand that this feature is disabled by default, but this directory is created by salt (or packaging) itself, so it should use sane permissive defaults for the base-dir, or respect original file permissions at least.
