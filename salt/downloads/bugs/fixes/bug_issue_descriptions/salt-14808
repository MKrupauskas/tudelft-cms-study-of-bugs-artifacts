I recently fixed an issue related to the rackspace.py provider in #14748 

I'd like to apply the same fix to the openstack.py provider as well, but I can't find the `win_installer` check in the develop branch.

Here's the version report from my installed version where I've applied this patch manually.

```
           Salt: 2014.1.7
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.3.0
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 14.0.1
            ZMQ: 4.0.4
```

Here's my working diff:

```
722c722
<                 'win_password', vm_, __opts__, default=''

---
>                 'win_password', vm_, __opts__, default=data.extra['password']
```

I just don't have anywhere to put this patch on the current develop branch. Looking for some guidance here.
