**Description**
My pillar will become unavailable sometimes.
It happens randomly.
`salt-call pillar.get mypillar` will return empty, then after a few seconds, it returns my data.

I used the following script to catch the time when pillar is not available
```
for i in {1..10000}; do 
TIMESTAMP=`date`
 salt-call pillar.get mypillar 2>/dev/null  |grep myvalue >/dev/null|| echo "getting empty pillar at ${TIMESTAMP}"
sleep 1;
done
```

After running for a few hours, the script returned
```
