Let's take an example

test-group:
  group.present:
    - name: test
    - gid: 10000

test-user:
  user.present:
    - name: test
    - uid: 10000
    - gid: 10000
    - home: /foo/bar
    - shell: /bin/sh

it will create a user which home is /foo/test. This doesn't work as documented and the thing is in fact broken, because the next salt run will fix the user's passwd entry so that home=/foo/bar.

I will create a pull request to fix this.
