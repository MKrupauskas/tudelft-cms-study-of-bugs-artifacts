With the latest salt from develop branch I get the following error when running a highstate or pillar.item

```
salt 'salt.example.lan' state.highstate
salt.example.lan:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering Primary Top file failed, render error:
'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'
```

Tested it against the 2014.7 no warnings.

Yesterday the salt development branch worked, something in the last 24 hours has produced this bug.
