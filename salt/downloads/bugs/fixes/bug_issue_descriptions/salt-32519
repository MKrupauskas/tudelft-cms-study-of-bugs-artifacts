### Description of Issue/Question

Similar to #32517 but in this instance it is only pointing to one master and its a different error. At the head of 2015.8 When a minion cannot reach a master that is down there is an error in the logs and the minions shows that it is restarting.
### Setup

/etc/salt/minion:

master: ipaddress
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Make sure the minion has been accepted on the master and you can communicate
2. Stop Both the Master and Minion
3. Start minion and watch it attempt to authenticate against the master. When it cannot authenticate with the masters it then restarts the salt-minion and I get an error:

```

The minion does restart and when the master comes back online the minion is able to connect to the master just fine, the issue is the error and the minion restarting.

Also to note I did edit scripts.py to have exc_info=True instead of false so I could get the stack trace error:

log.error('Minion failed to start: {0}'.format(exc.message), exc_info=True)
