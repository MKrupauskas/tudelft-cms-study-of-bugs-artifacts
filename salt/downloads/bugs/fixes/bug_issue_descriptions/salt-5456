I added to one of my template a context variable called `state`.

```
/tmp/output:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://not_important
    - template: jinja
    - context:
      state: whatever
```

result:

```
whatever_|-/tmp/output_|-/tmp/output_|-managed:
    ----------
    __run_num__:
        0
    changes:
        ----------
    comment:
        Specified state whatever.managed is unavailable.

    name:
        /tmp/output
    result:
        False
```

so... look like state is a reserved keyword, or at least undocumented in http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.managed

if context contains variables used internally by salt, should they be a little hidden to end user to avoid collision? such as `__state` instead of `state`?
