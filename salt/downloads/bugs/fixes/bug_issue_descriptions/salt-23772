Happy to be proven wrong here, but from my best understanding, calls to lxc.init will always fail as long as it attempts to remove the seed marker prior to starting the container.

`remove_seed_marker` is set to `True` at:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/lxc.py#L1197

The bit that looks like it could use some reordering is:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/lxc.py#L1230-L1259

Steps to reproduce:

```
$ salt-call lxc.init testbuntu template=ubuntu options="{'release':'trusty', 'arch': 'amd64'}"
```

First failure is in `attachable()`

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'lxc-attach --clear-env -n testbuntu -- /usr/bin/env' failed with return code: 1
```
