Using the latest develop on Archlinux:

```

```

When executing `salt-ssh -E 'foo|bar' -r 'echo test'`

The following error occurs:

```
[ERROR   ] Failed matching available minions with pcre pattern: pat|wal
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/minions.py", line 517, in check_minions
    minions = check_func(expr, greedy)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/minions.py", line 152, in _check_pcre_minions
    os.chdir(os.path.join(self.opts['pki_dir'], self.acc))
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/salt/pki/master/minions'
```

But after the error, the command is still executed on each client, and the result is returned. Seems it's doing something extra along what it normally does.
