In my state I'd like to download a file (tgz). There are - at least - 3 ways of doing that: `file.managed` with an http source, a `cmd.run` with `curl` or `wget` or `archive.extacted`.

Since the first option doesn't extract and the third option feels more practical than the second option I chose the third one.

In my state file:

```
install_server:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /tmp/server
    - source: {{ server_download_url }}
    - source_hash: md5={{ server_md5 }}
    - tar_options: XF
    - archive_format: tar
    - if_missing: /tmp/server/{{server_revision}}/
    - keep: True
```

(parameters have been set above and are irrelevant to this example)

Running this in a state results in getting an SaltException about keys not being in the state return:

```
