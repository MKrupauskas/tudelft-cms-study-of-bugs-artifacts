In the latest debian and ubuntu

`service networking restart` is deprecated 

The `debian_ip` module uses `service networking restart`

Suggested method for restarting networking is now:

```
su -
nohup sh -c "ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0"
```

or

```
su -
nohup sh -c "invoke-rc.d networking stop; sleep 2; invoke-rc.d networking start"
```

The module should be changed so the network is restarted.
