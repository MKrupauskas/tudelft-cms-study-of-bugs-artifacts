- Using `augeas.change` without supplying the `context` as in the following example will generate an exception:

```
redis-conf:
  augeas.change:
    - changes:
      - set /files/etc/redis/redis.conf/bind 0.0.0.0
```

- If a context is set and user still uses the full path, context is appended to the change duplicating
  the path.

`set: {'path': "/files/etc/redis/redis.conf/files/etc/redis/redis.conf/bind'", 'value': '0.0.0.0'}`

Of course when that is sent to the underlying liberary it will generate an error as the path will not be found.
- When invalid change options are set, it will raise an exception instead of handling that and returning an error message.

- Tests require improvement as the above could not be picked up with the current single test.
