### Description of Issue/Question
`acme.cert` [enforces that the private key file is mode `0600`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2018.3.2/salt/modules/acme.py#L183), so setting the group ownership using the `group` option does not actually result in another group being able to read the private key.

Please change the permission to `0640`, which is the only sensible default, given that there is a `group` parameter which defaults to `root`.  Perhaps consider making it configurable.

### Setup
```yaml
somegroup:
  group.present

some.example.com:
  acme.cert:
    - email: webmaster@example.com
    - group: somegroup
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Apply that state to a minion.
2. After a successful highstate, confirm that group `somegroup` cannot read the private key file.

### Versions Report
2018.3.2, but looking at the code suggests that it's still present in develop.
