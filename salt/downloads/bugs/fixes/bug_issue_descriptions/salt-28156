The following top file used to work on all salt versions 2015.8.0 and earlier, but has broken with 2015.8.1.

The pillar "environment" is defined via an external pillar (pepa).

``` salt
base:
  'I@environment:test':
    - match: compound
    - motd
dev:
  'I@environment:dev':
    - match: compound
    - motd
qa:
  'I@environment:qa':
    - match: compound
    - motd
pilot:
  'I@environment:pilot':
    - match: compound
    - motd
prod:
  'I@environment:prod':
    - match: compound
    - motd
```

2015.8.0 yields a working highstate, whereas 2015.8.1 returns No States
