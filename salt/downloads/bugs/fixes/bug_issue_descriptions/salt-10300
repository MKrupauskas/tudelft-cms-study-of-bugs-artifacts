I can't apply the feature described in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/defaults.py#L51 :

error: https://np.adm.sx/view/4c3fe02c 
srccode: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/defaults.py

I'm using the example from the doc in the source code. I added a line after line 120 in my local source code (which shouldn't matter).

Using defaults.get works on the CLI but doesn't in a SLS file.

```
$ salt host defaults.get mykey
```
