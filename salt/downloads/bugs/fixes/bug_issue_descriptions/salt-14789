I was using the following Salt snippet on CentOS 6.5

```
minimaldesktop:
  module.run:
    - name: pkg.group_install
    - m_name: [ 
        'Desktop',
        'Desktop Platform',
        'X Window System',
        'Fonts'
      ]
```

And received a "No groups available in any repository" error.  I Googled around and traced the failure to yumpkg.py and added the --plugins option to lines 1346 and 1370, did a saltutil.sync_modules and now it functions correctly (for me).  

I noticed that elsewhere in this file the --plugins option is included, but not in the group_info() function.  Should it be, or is my case an outlier?
