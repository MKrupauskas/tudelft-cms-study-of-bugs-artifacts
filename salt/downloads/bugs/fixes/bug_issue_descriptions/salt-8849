I've been following the documentation @ http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/event/index.html

So, I have the event listener code running on the master side, and it's happily returning events as I got them via `iter_events(full=True)` call.

Now to fire events from any minions!

``` bash
salt-call event.fire_master 'message for the master' 'tag'
```

Yup, that works.

``` python
import salt.utils.event
sock_dir = '/var/run/salt/minion'
payload = {'sample-msg': 'this is a test'}
event = salt.utils.event.SaltEvent('master', sock_dir)
event.fire_event(payload, 'tag')
```

This however, does not work, nothing seems to happen. I tried changing `'master'` to the actual master id, or event the minion id, but still, I see nothing coming through the event bus. I'm running the code on other minions as well as minion that is running on the master server. Anything else I might forget?
