Whenever an error occurs within the `rabbitmq_plugin` state it returns a dictionary into the Comment field instead of a sensible error. 

An example of what it would put into this field:

```
{"pid": 8105, "retcode": 1, "stderr": "erlexec: HOME must be set", "stdout": ""}
```

Perhaps it should only put the `stderr` (and maybe also `stdout`) content into the Comment field as a string rather than a dictionary.
