I am using the following state to mount NFS shares and switch from a backup (static2):

```
include:
  - lighttpd
  - foo.nfs

static1-lighttpd-stop:
  service:
    - dead
    - name: lighttpd
    - prereq:
      - mount: nfs-var-www-static1

nfs-var-www-static1:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: /var/www/static
    - device: 10.10.23.74://static.foo.com
    - fstype: nfs4
    - opts:
      - proto=tcp
      - port=2049
    - require:
      - file: nfs-idmapd
      - file: /var/www/static
      - pkg: nfs-common-package
      - service: nfs-common-service
    - require_in:
      - service: lighttpd

nfs-fstab-no-static2:
  file:
    - replace
    - name: /etc/fstab
    - pattern: '^10.10.23.94://static.foo.com.*\n'
    - repl: ''

nfs-fstab-no-old-static1:
  file:
    - replace
    - name: /etc/fstab
    - pattern: '^10.10.42.68://static.foo.com.*\n'
    - repl: ''
```

This state is the current one that causes the problem and differs from the one before in that it changed the device in nfs-var-www-static1 and introduced the static1-lighttpd-stop and nfs-fstab-no-old-static1 state. device in mount.mounted was using the IP from nfs-fstab-no-old-static1.

As always I performed a test=True highstate run before actually performing this change and was rather unpleasantly surprised to find that the NFS share wasn't mounted anymore. Further investigation revealed the following:

```

```

Which clearly shows that the nfs-fstab-no-old-static1 file.replace state actually performed changes despite the fact that the highstate run was executed with `test=True`.

I consider this to be quite suboptimal behaviour and would strongly prefer if highstate runs with `test=True` wouldn't actually change anything.

This is on a 2014.1.3 master and 2014.1.1 minion.
