The following state configuration:

```
packagename:
  pkg.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: someotherpackage
```

Will cause the package to be installed with the command:

```
pkg install  -yR packagename
```

Which does not actually install the package.

This appears to be due to the require option in salt.modules.pkgng.install "When used with force, reinstalls any packages that require the given package.". I suspect this option needs to be renamed from "require" to avoid conflicting with require from the state.
