Consider the following master config:

```
fileserver_backend:
  - git

gitfs_provider: gitpython
gitfs_base: dl
gitfs_root: salt

gitfs_remotes:
    - ssh://git@source.gitlab.com/devops/ops.git

ext_pillar:
    - git:
      - dl ssh://git@source.gitlab.com/devops/ops.git:
        - root: salt/pillar
```

From that I would assume that the branch that would be referenced would be the 'dl' branch yes?

In my cache dir I see the following here: /var/cache/salt/master/gitfs/5eac921619e32e399818342f847b05a9/.git/HEAD

```
ref: refs/heads/master
```

I would expect it refer to ref: refs/heads/dl 

git status in my gitfs cache repo shows

```
On branch master

Initial commit
```

Which is incorrect even for the master.. seeing as there are a lot more commits than just the initial one. :)

It seems my ext_pillar is correct. My git_pillar git status shows:

```
HEAD detached at origin/dl
```

It would seem as though the gitfs is not honoring the aforementioned gitfs_base property.
