Basically the problem is that one of the repos in my gitfs_remotes has some files with utf8 characters in the filename. The files aren't used in any state, or opened, or examined in anyway, except by gitfs; which then fails to load ALL git remote roots because of this:

```
$ sudo salt-run fileserver.dir_list
    [ … snip … ]
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/gitfs.py", line 71, in _utf8_path_join
      return os.path.join(a,*b)
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 71, in join
      path +=  b
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe3 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
```

My workaround is this evil patch, which I did not submit as a pull request because it's probably the wrong thing to do:
jettero@8331d95bb07b82e32e8b7cb450a8eed1b54ad01f
