We have 400+ minions and they were all talking to the master fine and, it appears, that suddenly they are all having issues authenticating with the master.  I verified that the minion can resolve the master hostname

From the minion:

```
root@chronos:~# salt-call state.highstate
[WARNING ] SaltReqTimeoutError: Waited 60 seconds
Minion failed to authenticate with the master, has the minion key been accepted?
```

from the master:

```
root@overseer:~# salt chronos state.highstate
[ERROR   ] Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased.
Failed to authenticate, is this user permitted to execute commands?
```

The minion's key is accepted on the master. Additionally the master is configured with `auto_accept: True` and `open_mode: True`. Still, I verified that the minion keys are the same on master and the minion.

Minion key on the minion

```
root@chronos:~# md5sum /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pub
f5865d0e910941a0afdebc6dbac02567  /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pub
```

Minion key on the master

```
root@overseer:~# md5sum /etc/salt/pki/master/minions/chronos
f5865d0e910941a0afdebc6dbac02567  /etc/salt/pki/master/minions/chronos
```

Verify that the minion pub key is in fact from the given private key

```
root@chronos:~# openssl rsa -in /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem  -pubout | md5sum
writing RSA key
f5865d0e910941a0afdebc6dbac02567  -
```

I also looked at the master's key, and verified that it is the same on the minion (it hasn't been changed since September 2013). 

Master key on the minion

```
root@chronos:~# md5sum /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub
95cfefcf878dd680e0386fe95ed94fea  /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub
```

Master key on the master

```
root@overseer:~# md5sum /etc/salt/pki/master/master.pub
95cfefcf878dd680e0386fe95ed94fea  /etc/salt/pki/master/master.pub
```

Verify that the master pub key is in fact from the given private key

```
root@overseer:~# openssl rsa -in /etc/salt/pki/master/master.pem -pubout | md5sum
writing RSA key
95cfefcf878dd680e0386fe95ed94fea  -
```

I also tried running the master and minion in debug mode, and I did not see anything that stands out. It also shows minion being authenticated

```
[INFO    ] Authentication request from chronos
[INFO    ] Authentication accepted from chronos
```

And as I said, this is happening on ALL of the minions. I don't know what else to check.
