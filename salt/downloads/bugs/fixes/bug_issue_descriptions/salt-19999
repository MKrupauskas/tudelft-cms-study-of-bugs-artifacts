Hi,

Since i upgraded my salt-master server (Linux Centos 6.5) from salt 2014.1.13 to 2014.7.0, my minions (Linux, 2014.1.13 and 2014.7.0) are eating memory randomly (10 servers in a few days on up to 200 minions). Windows minions aren't affected.

A few days ago, i downgraded salt-master from 2014.7.0 to 2014.1.13 and the problem disappeared. I didn't see useful information in logs. What kind of information could be useful for you to help debugging ?

regards
Pierre
