Hi,
I have an issue on openSUSE releases 11.x, it seem's they where not able to use the service module,.
Service on openSUSE 11 are not using the systems as on 12.x but more the redhat services (/etc/init.d/, chkconfig, ..)

I have made some changes in the rh_service.py module but it seem's Im' not a great python dev.
If you can correct this it will save my life :)

if you need more infos . let me know
Regards
Claude
