On line 214 of https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/user.py#L214 it's stated that the following items need to be specified as a string to ensure values are loaded properly, however the fullname variable isn't forced to be a string like the others are on line [230](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/user.py#L230). This can create an edge case that generates errors where a user inputs an actual name the first time, but then changes that name to a integer on subsequent runs. Is there any reason that the fullname variable isn't also turned into a string? If not, I'll fix this later.
