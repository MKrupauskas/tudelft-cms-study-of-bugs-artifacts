**Description**
state.show_state_usage fails when server has the enterprise plugin enabled, seems to be related to the sse environments, maybe missing a top.sls files for highstate.

**Setup**
In a server with raas.conf disable raas.conf and define highstate top under /srv/salt/top.sls, something simple will work like all minions running a test state.
Execute the highstate to make sure everything works ok
then run state.show_state_usage 

Once confirmed it works ok, stop salt-master, re enable raas.conf and re-start salt-master
Try state.show_state_usage again and it would fail.


Please be as specific as possible and give set-up details.

- [ ] VM (Virtualbox, KVM, etc. please specify)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD
