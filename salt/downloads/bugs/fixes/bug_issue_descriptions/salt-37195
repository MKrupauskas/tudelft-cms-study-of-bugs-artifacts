### Description of Issue/Question

According to the documentation at this URL:
  https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/cli/salt-api.html
the salt-api service should send salt-api log output to:
  /var/log/salt/api

However, this does not appear to be the case.  Log data may instead be seen in syslog output or by running the salt-api process in the foreground.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Configure and start Salt API
2. Make RESTful calls.
3. Look for log output at /var/log/salt/api (file not present)
### Versions Report

This was observed on 2016.11.0rc1, 2016.3.2, and 2015.8.3.
