### Description of Issue/Question
The functionality of apt-transport-https has been moved into the main apt package lately and apt-transport-https became a "transitional dummy package". But any attempt to purge the package always results in a failure on both Ubuntu bionic and Debian buster.

First run, while package is still installed:
```
myminion:
----------
          ID: apt-transport-https
    Function: pkg.purged
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to purge: apt-transport-https.

              ----------
              installed:
                  ----------
                  apt-transport-https:
                      ----------
                      new:
                          1
                      old:
                          1.6.2
              removed:
                  ----------

Failed:    1
------------
Total states run:     1

```
However, although the package has been purged by this run, all subsequent runs also fail:
```
myminion:
----------
          ID: apt-transport-https
    Function: pkg.purged
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to purge: apt-transport-https.

              removed:
