I already have salt cloud configured with digitalocean and can successfully create and destroy CentOS and ubuntu images.  Trying to create a FreeBSD image results in an error.

Also, why is `10.2` unique enough to specify `FreeBSD 10.2`?  That seems like a poor design to me, but I don't know if this is coming from digitalocean or the digitalocean salt-cloud driver.  If all contemporary OS versions are unique, that is lucky at best, and also frustratingly ambiguous.
