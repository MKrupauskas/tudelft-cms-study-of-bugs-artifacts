salt-call grains.items is returning no GPUs on a system with a Radeon HD 3450 installed. I am currently on salt 0.16.3 running SL 6.4 x86_64.

```
# lspci -vmm
Slot:   01:00.0
Class:  VGA compatible controller
Vendor: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI
Device: RV620 LE [Radeon HD 3450]
SVendor:        Dell
SDevice:        OptiPlex 980
```

```
# salt-call grains.items
...
gpus:                               <-- I get an empty list.
...
num_gpus:
    0
```

Expected output should be:

```
gpus:
    ----------
    - model:
        RV620 LE [Radeon HD 3450]
    - vendor:
        ati
...
num_gpus:
    1
```

I took a quick glance at the code, but didn't see anything obvious that was preventing it from parsing it properly...
