### Description of Issue/Question

It looks like some changes in #45781 or #46542 broke the `salt.pillar.gpg` https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/pillar/all/salt.pillar.gpg.html:

```
% tail -2 etc/salt/minion
ext_pillar:
  - gpg: {}

% cat pillar/test.sls
key: value

% LANG=C salt-call --local pillar.items
[WARNING ] Could not decrypt cipher value, received: b'gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.\n[GNUPG:] NODATA 1\n[GNUPG:] NODATA 2\ngpg: decrypt_message failed: eof\n'
[WARNING ] Could not decrypt cipher value, received: b'gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.\n[GNUPG:] NODATA 1\n[GNUPG:] NODATA 2\ngpg: decrypt_message failed: eof\n'
local:
    ----------
    key:
        value
```

If I restore the `salt/renderers/gpg.py` back to the `2013.3.3` state, everything works as expected.
