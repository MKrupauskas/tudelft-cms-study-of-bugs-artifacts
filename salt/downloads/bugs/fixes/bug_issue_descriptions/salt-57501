**Description**
A lot of my minions are logging the message

```
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/utils/msgpack.py:128: DeprecationWarning: encoding is deprecated, Use raw=False instead.
```

This issue looks related to Issue #51398, but is surfacing at another location

**Setup**
N/A

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Control reaches https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/serializers/msgpack.py#L49 with salt.utils.msgpack.version >= (0.5.2)

In this case, options.setdefault() will set encoding='utf-8', but encoding is deprecated asmsgpack version 0.5.2. The options.setdefault() call should be setting raw=False in this case.

**Expected behavior**
salt/serializers/msg.py.py doesn't log DeprecationWarnings

**Screenshots**
