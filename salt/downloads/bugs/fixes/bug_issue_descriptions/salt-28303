When using the configuration with "server/public_key/secret_key" etc. the logger fails to work. 

I thought it was #26274 but dug deeper and ended up trying out the simpler configuration with the "dsn" attribute. This ended up working. 

The functionality should be the same when using the two ways of configuring it (or remove one of them).
