I'm installing the ownCloud Ubuntu / Debian packages via Salt. Since ownCloud 8, there is a more modular setup and the package owncloud is now split into 3 different packages.
The owncloud package is just a virtual package, directing to these three.

So when installing the virtual package `owncloud` all thee of these packages get installed, which is what I want. But Salt lists the installation as false:

```
----------
          ID: owncloud_packages
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: owncloud 3 targeted packages were installed/updated.

              â€¦
----------
```

After another run, it correctly shows the already installed packages.

```
----------
          ID: owncloud_packages
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True

                  new:
                      1
                  old:
              owncloud-pgsql:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      1
                  old:
              owncloud-sqlite:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      1
                  old:
```

So the fix should probably list  "x targeted packages were installed/updated." as successful.
