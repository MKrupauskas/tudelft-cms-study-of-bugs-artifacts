Hi,

New to saltstack, I noticed on windows minions, that the c:\salt directory is accessible (write/read) to standard users.
It's an issue, I think, since the users can read cache files, that can contain clear passwords, for example, and even change minion configuration, and eventually (not tested this) use salt-call commands to setup softwares...
I just wrote an powershell script that fixes this, removing permissions for standard users (BUILTIN\Users and NT AUTHORITY\authenticated Users)
I join it here... If it can help...
