I can reproduce this on my environment consistently.

I'd like to debug this and just need some advice on where best to get information.

If I run `salt 'machine name' state.highstate` I nearly always get no output - it runs but returns after about 30 seconds. Checking the server, the high state is still running. All calls to `salt 'machine name' X.X` will then return immediately with no output until several minutes have passed.

If this has been raised already, please point me to the topic. If not, shout over the best logs to get and I'll put them up for you.

Both server and client are from EPEL and running on RHEL 6.5
Minion: salt-minion-2014.1.5-1.el6.noarch
Master: salt-master-2014.1.5-1.el6.noarch

This was happening on 2014.1.4 too IIRC, and also sporadically on previous versions.
