After upgrading to 2015.8.8.2 from 2015.8.7 I'm having the following error:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command ['git', 'ls-remote', 'git@my_project:my_project/configs.git'] as user 'root' in directory '/root'

Running the same command in shell works fine:

```
# git ls-remote git@my_project:my_project/configs.git

Reverting back to 2015.8.7 fixes the issue.
