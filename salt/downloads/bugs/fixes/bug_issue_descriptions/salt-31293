We have a salt master configured with several git pillar repos.  About once a day we start getting these errors:

```
Error occured fetching git_pillar remote 'staging git@github.com:myorg/saltstack-pillars.git': Reference 'HEAD' not found 
Exception caught while initializing git_pillar remote 'staging git@github.com:myorg/saltstack-pillars.git': tuple index out of range 
```

We resolve the issue each day by deleting /var/cache/salt/master/git_pillar

Looking into /var/cache/salt/master/git_pillar/c245a5b583965a1bc938b8104013601c/.git/  I see that HEAD is actually missing.  What would cause HEAD to be deleted randomly?

master config: (all other gitpillar settings are default)

```
ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - staging git@github.com:myorg/saltstack-pillars.git:
      - privkey: /root/.ssh/id_rsa2
      - pubkey: /root/.ssh/id_rsa2.pub
      - env: base
  - git:

The same error appears in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/28298 which should be resolved in 2015.8.5, so I don't think they are the same issue.
