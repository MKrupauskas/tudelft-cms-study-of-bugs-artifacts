After updating to 2015.2.0rc1 I see strange error messages in the log:

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'modinfo zfs' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: ERROR: modinfo: could not find module zfs
[ERROR   ] Command 'modinfo zfs' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: ERROR: modinfo: could not find module zfs
```

We are not using zfs anywhere so I'm not sure why this gets reported by saltstack.
