I was occupied with a strange error when designing our salt files recently.

That's the output:

```
          ID: checkout_release
    Function: cmd.run
        Name: git checkout release
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/tmp/.root_dcdf8c_salt/salt/state.py", line 1591, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/tmp/.root_dcdf8c_salt/salt/states/cmd.py", line 784, in run
                  if cwd and not os.path.isdir(cwd):
                File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/genericpath.py", line 41, in isdir
                  st = os.stat(s)
              TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, dict found
     Started: 10:34:34.794163
    Duration: 1.875 ms
```

Re-executing the corresponding sls file, yields success.

This was reproducible, so I decided start with a clean minion and see what show_sls gave me:

```
    checkout_release:
        ----------
        __env__:
            release
        __sls__:
            home
        cmd:
            |_
              ----------
              name:
                  git checkout release
            |_
              ----------
              user:
                  my_user
            |_
              ----------
              group:
                  my_group
            |_
              ----------
              cwd:
                  ----------
                  _error:
                      Failed to return clean data
                  retcode:
                      1
                  stderr:
                      [CRITICAL] Unable to import msgpack or msgpack_pure python modules
                      Error running 'virtualenv.get_distribution_path': Path does not appear to be a virtualenv: '/home/my_user/bin/python'
                  stdout:
            |_
              ----------
              require:
                  |_
                    ----------
                    pip:
                        create_virtualenv
            - run
            |_
              ----------
              order:
                  10005
```

That helps to understand why `os.stat(s)` receives a dict and not a string. Could we do thing here to make bug-hunting easier?

The original issue results because the Jinja rendering process takes place before the state execution. Unfortunately, the rendering of the state, which looks like this:

```
checkout_release:
  cmd.run:
    - name: git checkout release
    - user: my_user
    - group: my_group
    - cwd: {{ salt['virtualenv.get_distribution_path'](system_home, project_name) }}
    - require:
      - virtualenv: create_virtualenv
```

is dependent on the successful execution of some states prior to `checkout_release` (namely 'create_virtualenv'). What can we do about this?
