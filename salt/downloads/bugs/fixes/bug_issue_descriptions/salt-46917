### Description of Issue/Question
The Debian repositories were updated to 2018.3.0 and our MySQL grants were no longer applied correctly.

On a 2017.7.4 host:
```[DEBUG   ] Grant Query generated: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mycompany`.* TO %(user)s@%(host)s args {'host': 'localhost', 'user': 'mycompany'}```

On a 2018.3.0 host:
```[DEBUG   ] Grant Query generated: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `mycompany`.`*` TO %(user)s@%(host)s args {u'host': u'localhost', u'user': u'mycompany'}```

We have no table named `*`. It is supposed to be treated as a glob.

The mysql execution module is at fault. This is why:
```
$ grep "is not '" mysql.py
        if dbc is not '*':
        if table is not '*':
    if dbc is not '*':
    if table is not '*':
```
It looks like the introduction of unicode_literals in commit 2e8b86a944c02285a7145a017e86d6573290c02c cause the above comparisons to always fail since they now compare a str type to a unicode type. I assume these should be using `!=` instead? I'll put together a PR shortly.

### Setup
```
Grant all privileges on mycompany.* for mycompany:
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: all privileges
    - database: mycompany.*
    - user: mycompany
    - host: localhost
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
The key is adding a grant for a user to all tables associated with a database using `<database>.*` syntax.
