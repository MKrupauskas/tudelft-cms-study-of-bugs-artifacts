A couple of months ago (coupled with the Gentoo Portage rework), layman started having a division between official and unofficial overlays.

When an overlay is unofficial, the user is prompted about this and asked to either accept adding it or deny it.

It seems this has broken Salt's layman module with regards to adding an overlay. I tried it and got no output (no error or anything) on the master, and when I went to look at the minion's log, I saw:

```
2015-08-02 00:28:10,513 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ][6219] Command 'layman --quietness=0 --add bitcoin' failed with return code: 1
2015-08-02 00:28:10,513 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ][6219] output: 
 * Adding overlay...
 * Overlay "bitcoin" is not an official. Continue install? [y/n]: 
 * CLI: Errors occurred processing action add
 * Exception caught installing repository 'bitcoin' : EOF when reading a line
```
