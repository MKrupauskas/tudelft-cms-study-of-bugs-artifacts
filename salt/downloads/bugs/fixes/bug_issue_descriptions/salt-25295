Hello,

Running 2015.5.2 on service and minions.

Tried to upgrade a number of minions today and only got as far as them downloading the installer files from the server. When I kill the NSSM service and run salt in debug from command line, then the packages are installed successfully. When I go back to NSSM/LocalService it is unable to install packages again.

The media players automatically log into windows without a password, so I'm unable to start the service with the Administrator account.

Any idea what might be going wrong?
