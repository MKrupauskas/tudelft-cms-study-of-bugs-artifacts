**Description**
Salt reactor does not support all-digital minion_id.

**Setup**
salt-master 3001

/etc/salt/master.d/reactor.conf
```
`reactor:
    - 'salt/minion/*/start':
      - /srv/reactor/sync.sls`
```

/srv/reactor/sync.sls
```
sync_everything:
  local.saltutil.sync_all:
    - tgt: {{ data['id'] }}
    - kwarg:
        refresh: True
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Execute in minion systemctl restart salt-minion
Get Error in salt master log:
`2020-08-05 14:13:49,022 [salt.utils.minions:749 ][ERROR   ][17576] Failed matching available minions with glob pattern: 2001
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/minions.py", line 737, in check_minions
    _res = check_func(expr, greedy)  # pylint: disable=not-callable
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/minions.py", line 240, in _check_glob_minions
    return {"minions": fnmatch.filter(self._pki_minions(), expr), "missing": []}
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/fnmatch.py", line 51, in filter
    pat = os.path.normcase(pat)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/posixpath.py", line 54, in normcase
    s = os.fspath(s)
TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not int`

Then
I try to modify the source code
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/minions.py
line 240  old
return {"minions": fnmatch.filter(self._pki_minions(), expr), "missing": []}
line 240  change
return {"minions": fnmatch.filter(self._pki_minions(), str(expr)), "missing": []}

Final
I can get the event trigger from the event log, but there is no return, and the minion did not execute successfully.
