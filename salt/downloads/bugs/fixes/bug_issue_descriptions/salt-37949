### Description of Issue/Question

Some servers of mine have link-local IPv6 addresses in `resolv.conf`, i.e. lines like `nameserver fe80::1234:5678:9abc:def0%eth0`. As of 2016.11.0 both master and minion log complaints like the following:

```
[ERROR   ] /etc/resolv.conf: 'fe80::21b:21ff:fe34:d66a%bond0' does not appear to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address
```

It doesn't seem to be breaking anything so far, though â€” just spamming logs. (Perhaps such nameserver addresses were never supported, but now it's more visible?)
