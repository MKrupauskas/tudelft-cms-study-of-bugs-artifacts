I have a master per environment in my setup. We have an orchestrate job that handles our backups. In our dev environment, it works fine. When I moved it to our QA/Prod environments, it wouldn't work. I tracked it down to an error saying the SLS was not available. Then two days later I finally tracked down a workaround.

In dev, all our files are sitting in /srv/{salt,pillars,etc}. In QA/Prod they are all gitfs backends (for states and pillars). When I throw that single orchestrate file in /srv/salt on QA/Prod manually, they start working.

Let me know if you need any other information. And no, I can't try 2014.7 to see if it's fixed already.
