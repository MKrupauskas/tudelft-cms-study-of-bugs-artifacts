file.copy now will ensure ownership of files when using file.copy and there's no way to disable this. If preserve is True. I don't understand why salt needs to ensure the ownership at all? Just run cp...

Handling files this way causes serious issues with squashes. I'd bet all of the file modules are probably broken on squashed filesystems.
