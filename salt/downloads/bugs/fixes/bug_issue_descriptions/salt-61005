**Description**
Whenever I try to use `salt-cloud` 3004RC1 I'm getting:
```
[WARNING ] Config option 'bootstrap_delay' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a int is required for this option
```
This wasn't happening with the previous releases.

**Setup**
I'm using VmWare provider, but I suspect this would be happening with most others.
My config files for `salt-cloud` don't have `bootstrap_delay` specified anywhere. As far as I can see, it's also not specified in the default configuration which comes from RPM packages.

  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Any usage of `salt-cloud`.

**Expected behavior**
That warning should not be printed.

**Additional context**
I think the problem is in `config/__init__.py`. It has:
```
"bootstrap_delay": int,
```
which (I think) specifies the type for the option. But then, in `DEFAULT_CLOUD_OPTS` there is:
```
"bootstrap_delay": None,
```
which is why we're getting the warning from some code unrelated to `salt-cloud`, most likely.
I suppose `None` should be changed to zero and all would be well.
