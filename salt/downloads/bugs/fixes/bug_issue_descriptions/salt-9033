I have a pillar SLS which, among other things, defines the following:

```
roles:
  - build-server
  - salt-master
```

Another SLS then includes the former under a key named `host1`. Pillar `top.sls` applies the former SLS to the minion with id `host1.org`, and the second SLS to all minions. When I run `salt host1.org pillar.data`, I see that `roles` has both list items (as expected), but `host1.roles` only has a single item (`build-server`). This causes my state logic to fail on `highstate`.

Salt 0.17.2.2, Ubuntu 13.x
