When previously building network interfaces with saltstack 2014.7.5

``` yaml
eth1:
 network.managed:
  - enabled: True
  - type: slave
  - mtu: 9000
  - master: bond0 
```

The following would create in the /etc/network/interfaces file

```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet manual
mtu 9000
bond_master bond0
```

After upgrading to 2015.5.0 it will build the interfaces file as such

```
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet manual
mtu 9000
bond-master bond0
```

The dash in bond-master then breaks interface parsing

``` console
# salt-call ip.get_interface eth1
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

Correcting the dash back to an underscore restores proper functionality, but states using bond attempt to get re-applied with a dash instead of an underscore

``` console
# salt-call ip.get_interface eth1
local:
    - auto eth1
    - iface eth1 inet manual
    -     mtu 9000
    -     bond-master bond0
    -
```
