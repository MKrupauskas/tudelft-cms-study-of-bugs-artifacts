``` yaml
/home/appname/capture:
  mount.unmounted:
    - persist: true
```

With this state, on the first run, the mount is unmounted and removed from the fstab. On the second run, it gets:

``` bash
          ID: /home/appname/capture
    Function: mount.unmounted
      Result: False
     Comment: Target was already unmounted. Unfortunately the mount could not be purged
     Changes:   
```

I believe the logic here is bad. If it doesn't unmount the mount (since it was already unmounted), it should still try to remove it from /etc/fstab if `persist=True` as someone could have manually unmounted it in the interim, or salt could have. Perhaps the logic where it says:

```
        if out == 'bad mount':
```

Could simply be changed to `else`?

This is on RHEL7 64 bit:
