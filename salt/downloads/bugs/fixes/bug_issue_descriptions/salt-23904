#21894 introduced the usage of dashes for attribute names in the network bonding section (like `bond-master` etc.). This seems to break the parsing of the generated files, which still splits the string on underscores and leads to an error in [salt/modules/debian_ip.py#L599](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/7d8038f13439375724f9417e51441441764d15bb/salt/modules/debian_ip.py#L599).
