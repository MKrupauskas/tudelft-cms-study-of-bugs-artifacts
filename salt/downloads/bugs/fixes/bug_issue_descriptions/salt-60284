**Description**
A `cmd.run` during `test=true` that "would have been executed" does not have any changes, obviously becuase the cmd hasn't run yet.

Because `cmd.run` has no changes, `service.running` that has a watch on that `cmd.run` during `test=true` does not mention "Service is set to be restarted".

There is logic already present for `cmd.run`, e.g. unless/onlyif, which helps to determine if `cmd.run` is going to _something_.

**Setup**
foo.sls (simplified example)
```yaml
cmd_test:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo test > /test
    - unless: grep test /test

service_test:
  service.running:
    - name: postfix
    - watch:
        - cmd: cmd_test
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
- `echo something > /test`
- `salt-call state.apply foo test=true`  service_test not mentioning going to restart
- `salt-call state.apply foo`  service_test restarted

**Expected behavior**
service_test should mention: "Service is set to be restarted" during `test=true`
