I noticed that if you `sudo apt-get -y install salt-master=2015.8.3+ds-1` or install using 

```
curl -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com -o install_salt.sh
sudo sh install_salt.sh -M stable 2015.8 
```

on Ubuntu 14.04, that there is a `master.d` directory located in `/etc/salt/master.d` on the `salt-master`. However, if you install using 

```
curl -o install_salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sudo sh install_salt.sh -M -N -P -S git v2015.8.3
```

there is no `/etc/salt/master.d` directory on the `salt-master`. I'm using this directory to add configs and had to manually add them to the `salt-master` since I want to bootstrap using `git v2015.8.3`.
