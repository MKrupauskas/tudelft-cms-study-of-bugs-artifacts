### Description of Issue

I'm mounting a Windows fileshare with the mount.mounted state and every time the state runs it forces a remount with the message `Forced remount because options (credentails=/root/.win-share) changed`.
This seems to be because credentails= doesn't appear in /proc/self/mountinfo but is instead replaced with the username found in the credentails file. I.e., it will apear as `username=foo`. Appears very similar to #45136.

### Setup
```
my-fileshare:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: /mnt/windows
    - device: //windows-server/path
    - fstype: cifs
    - opts: credentials=/root/.win-share,rw
    - mkmnt: True
    - persist: True
```

The file /root/.win-share takes the form:

```
username=foo
password=bar
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Every time the state is run it will force remount the share.
