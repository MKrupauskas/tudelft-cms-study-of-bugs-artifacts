Can't install on either of the two distributions using the epel repository. I get the exact error as posted in the bug report. I can verify this happens on both Redhat 5.11 and CentOS 5. 

This also negates the installation documentation for the the above stated versions of Redhat and CentOS found here: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/rhel.html
