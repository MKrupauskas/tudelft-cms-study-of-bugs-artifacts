I recently updated SaltStack and Salt-SSH on an Oracle Linux server (with the yum install commands for both).  Now salt-ssh commands are mostly broken.  When I run this:
salt-ssh '*' test.ping
I get "retcode: 1" and this is the most recent part of the traceback:

```
File "/tmp/.root_778742__salt/urllib3/connectionpool.py", line 63, in <module> from     
.packages.ssl_match_hostname import match_hostname, CertificateError
ImportError: No module named packages.ssl_match_hostname stdout:
```

I therefore did this:
    pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname

But that requirement was already satisfied.  I'm using Python 2.6.6.

Why won't the salt-ssh commands work now?  A test.ping is very simple.  The salt-ssh -r (raw shell commands) still work.  It all broke after I updated the Salt Master and salt-ssh.
