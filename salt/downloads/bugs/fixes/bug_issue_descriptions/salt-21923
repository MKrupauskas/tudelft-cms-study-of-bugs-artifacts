Hi Guys: I've pasted my issue to this pastebin: http://pastebin.com/JJkweVmN

Essentially, after the minion is cloned salt cloud copies the required files and scripts across to the minion and SSHs in to run the scripts. This fails with this error: ERROR: Salt requires root privileges to install. Please re-run this script as root.

However, I've configured the option (as you'll see in the pastebin) sudo_password: mypassword, however it still dose not seem to work. It seems like it's a bug and simply not running sudo before the whoami. 

My workaround on Ubuntu was to enable the root user and tell salt to use that so when it runs it's whoami it returns root and the provisioning script can continue. 

In case the pastebin dies:

Configuration:
However, this is my configuration:

```
#Provider:
my-vsphere-config:
    provider: vsphere
    user: me
    password: my_password
    url: 'https://my_vsphere_url/sdk'

#PROFILE
my-ubuntu-14-04:
     provider: my-vsphere-config
     image: SALT-TRUSTY
     folder: sandy
     resourcepool: resgroup-8
     template_user: my_user
     template_password: my_password
     sudo_password: my_password
     deploy: True
     minion:
        master: my.masters.ip

#Orchestrate:
