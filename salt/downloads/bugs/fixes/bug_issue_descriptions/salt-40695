### Description of Issue/Question

I have a working salt/salt-cloud setup. Adding `sync_after_install: grains` to my /etc/salt/cloud file causes 100% of my salt-cloud runs to exit with failure.  The minion is configured properly (keys in place, bus up and functioning, etc) but salt-cloud just quits like a jerk face with:

````
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
````

This may be a duplicate of #34124 where users reported similar failures with 2016.3.0 (Arch) and 2016.3.4 (Xenial).

### Setup

Running salt-cloud on a master to spin new AWS minions. No notable master/cloud/minion config settings deviating from defaults.

/etc/salt/cloud
````
sync_after_install: grains
script: /etc/salt/cloud.deploy.d/bootstrap-salt.sh
script_args: stable 2016.11.3
````

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Add `sync_after_install: grains`  to your cloud config.
2. Spin an instance: `salt-cloud -l debug -p myprofile myhost.domain.tld
3. Wait till this shows up:

````

    return self._check_pub_data(pub_data)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 256, in _check_pub_data
    'Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this '
EauthAuthenticationError: Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
````

Everything works great when sync_after_install is commented out.
