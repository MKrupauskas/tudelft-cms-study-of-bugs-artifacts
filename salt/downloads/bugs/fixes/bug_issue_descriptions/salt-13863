I've been having random issues when deploying with salt-cloud using multiple configurations. Minion just dies after deployment.

provider.conf

```
do:
  provider: digital_ocean
  client_key: KEY
  api_key: KEY
  ssh_key_name: Salt Deploy
  ssh_key_file: /etc/salt/cloud.key/fsn_deploy
  minion:
    master: 10.128.144.172
    startup_states: highstate
    mine_functions:
      network.interfaces: []
      network.ip_addrs:
        - eth1
    mine_interval: 2
    log_level_logfile: debug
    log_level: debug
```

Notes: I've tried removing mine information (debug is something new I'm trying to see if I can catch the issue)

```
ubuntu_512MB_ny2:
  provider: do
  image: Ubuntu 14.04 x64
  size: 512MB
  location: New York 2
  private_networking: True
  script_args: '-- git develop'
```

Note: I did try with -D but no useful data was outputted

/var/log/salt/minion

```

```

Note: This happened after a minute, sometimes it was "Setting up..." "Failed sign in" (in the same second). Others was first 2 lines then failed (same second). As I said, pretty random.
If I get any new data I'll post it
