### Description of Issue
So Salt has this logic for batch execution: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/cli/batch.py#L246-L259

I have an orchestration, with batch and `failhard` set to `True` and sometimes get this exception:
```
2020-02-28 14:59:44,383 [salt.state] [ERROR]  An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1933, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1951, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/states/saltmod.py", line 331, in state
    cmd_ret = __salt__['saltutil.cmd'](tgt, fun, **cmd_kw)
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 1503, in cmd
    client, tgt, fun, arg, timeout, tgt_type, ret, kwarg, **kwargs)
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 1467, in _exec
    for ret_comp in _cmd(**cmd_kwargs):
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 574, in cmd_batch
    for ret in batch.run():
  File "/opt/behavox/salt/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/batch.py", line 258, in run
    if self.opts.get('failhard') and data['retcode'] > 0:
KeyError: 'retcode'
```

So I dig in and printed the `minion` and `data` variables from this logic during error and the problem was that for one minion data is `{'ret': {}}`.

I checked this minions logs and see that it has finished its logic correctly and sent the results back to master:
``` 
2020-02-28 14:56:08,445 [salt.minion] [INFO] [JID: 20200228145436184480] Returning information for job: 20200228145436184480
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
It's flapping and looks like only happening during the load.

### Versions Report
Same for master and minion.
