On a masterless windows minion, with file_client set to local and the git repo lines from the unix master added to bottom of windows minion conf file I get:

```
KeyError: 'git.latest'
    Line 1956:   File "salt/modules/win_repo.py", line 114, in update_git_repos
```

Here is the 'debug' output:

```

Is that not supposed to work? 

Note: I do have a working install of git in the path of that machine.

Here is the nearly 2000 lines of further debugging output in a gist https://gist.github.com/TheBigBear/3fa65236939b68dc7285
