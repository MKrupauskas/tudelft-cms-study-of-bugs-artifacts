### Description of Issue/Question
The development builds of the Atomic Linux family does not seem to be correctly identified as a systemd distro.

### Setup
```shell
# salt-ssh -i atomic-dev grains.item os kernel os_family
atomic-dev:
    ----------
    kernel:
        Linux
    os:
        CentOSDev Atomic Host
    os_family:
        CentOSDev Atomic Host
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Boot a Centos Atomic Linux host, run these commands to get a development build
```shell
ostree remote add --set=gpg-verify=false centos-atomic-continuous https://ci.centos.org/artifacts/sig-atomic/rdgo/centos-continuous/ostree/repo/
rpm-ostree rebase -r centos-atomic-continuous:centos-atomic-host/7/x86_64/devel/smoketested
```

Probably different prefixes will be reported on RHEL/Fedora builds of Atomic.
