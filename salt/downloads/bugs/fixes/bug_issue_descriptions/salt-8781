I setup this state in Saltstack 1.16.3 /srv/salt/pypy/init.sls:

```
/opt/pypy:
  file.recurse:
    - source: salt://pypy/pypy-2.2-linux64/
    - include_empty: true
/opt/pypy-virtualenv:
  virtualenv.managed:
    - path: /opt/pypy-virtualenv
    - python: /opt/pypy/bin/pypy
    - pip: True
```

When running salt '*' state.sls pypy, the following error occurs on the minion:

```
/bin/sh: 1: /opt/pypy-virtualenv/bin/python: not found
```

I think this is misleading -- the minion log shows:

```
2013-11-24 01:02:27,373 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ] Command 'virtualenv --python=/opt/pypy/bin/pypy /opt/pypy-virtualenv' failed with return code: 3
2013-11-24 01:02:27,374 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ] stdout: The executable /opt/pypy/bin/pypy (from --python=/opt/pypy/bin/pypy) is not executable
2013-11-24 01:02:27,378 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ] {'new': '/bin/sh: 1: /opt/pypy-virtualenv/bin/python: not found'}
```

I think it would be better to use

```
The executable /opt/pypy/bin/pypy (from --python=/opt/pypy/bin/pypy) is not executable
```

as an error message, or to check argument validity in _virtualenv_mod.py_ line 165.

Note that this issue report is not about the actual problem (I just forgot to set the correct file mode) but the misleading error message.

Please feel free to share your comments!

Thanks in advance for your support and for this awesome tool!
