### Description of Issue/Question
The pdbedit module is broken again after upgrading to Samba 4.9.2

Both pdbedit.list in verbose and non-verbose mode.

```
[atlas :: sjorge][~]
[.]$ salt-call pdbedit.list verbose=False
local:
    - Registered MSG_REQ_POOL_USAGE
    - Registered MSG_REQ_DMALLOC_MARK and LOG_CHANGED
    - lp_load_ex
    - Initialising global parameters
    - Processing section "[global]"
    - tmartine
    - sjorge
```

For non-verbose we should filter out all lines that do not follow the 'login:uid:full name' format,

```
[atlas :: sjorge][~]
[.]$ salt-call pdbedit.list
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: u'unix username'

```

### Setup
N/a

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run develop of salt against a pdbedit from samba 4.9.x

I will look into this when I have some a bit of time.
