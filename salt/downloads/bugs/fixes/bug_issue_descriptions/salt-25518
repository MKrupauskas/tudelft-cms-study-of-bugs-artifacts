When performing a compound search for two pillars, we often (not all of the time, sometimes this works as intended) result with 0 minions found/targeted.  This should not be the case because at least one minion should respond with the query.

``` python
 salt -C "I@components:pingfederate and I@environment:build08" test.ping --summary
Summary

 of Minions Targeted: 0
 of Minions Returned: 0
 of Minions Did Not Return: 0
```

And I've confirmed that both pillars exist with 'salt "minion_name" pillar.items'

We've increased the timeout to 5 minutes and the minion still did not respond.  We watched the minion log file /var/log/salt/minion and did not see any new logs when performing the query and running test.ping.

Need to find out why pillar component searches fail sometimes.
