I'm trying to set up my pillar to use both pillar_roots and git_pillar. I want to have two environments on the filesystem, and a third directly from git. For some strange reason the git_pillar is loaded, but it's not associated with an environment based on its branch name.

Relevant portion of the master config:

```
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /var/local/salt/pillar/base
  prod:
    - /var/local/salt/pillar/prod
  dev:
    - /does/not/exist

ext_pillar:
  - git: dev git+ssh://git@git.example.com/salt-pillar.git
```

N.B.: The pillar_roots entry for dev is to workaround a KeyError (which I should probably also open an issue for) that gets raised in git_pillar.py.

When running state.highstate, I get the following error:

```
pypi2:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Specified SLS 'datadog' in environment 'dev' is not available on the salt master
```

Relevant information from /var/log/salt/master

```

2013-08-27 00:33:18,531 [salt.pillar      ][CRITICAL] Pillar render error: Specified SLS 'datadog' in environment 'dev' is not available on the salt master
```

And running `pillar.get datadog` shows that it is populated:

```
pypi2:
    ----------
    api_key:
        aoeu
```

So, it looks like the pillar data is pulled from git, but not in the correct environment.
