I'm trying to create Windows EC2 instances with salt-cloud using the **ec2** driver. I want to handle bootstrapping of the box myself, so I added:

```
deploy: False
script: None
```

to my profiles. However, after creating the device salt-cloud still attempts to SSH into the box and takes a very long time to time out.

Looking at the code briefly, it looks to me like the **aws** driver had the "deploy: False" option but it's not in the **ec2** driver, which I think is a bug.
