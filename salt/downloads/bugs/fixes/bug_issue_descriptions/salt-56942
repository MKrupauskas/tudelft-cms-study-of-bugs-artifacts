Error on Python 3 (with older psutil):

```
# python3 /usr/bin/salt-call --local ps.top

Passed invalid arguments: '<' not supported between instances of 'Process' and 'Process'.

Usage:

    Return a list of top CPU consuming processes during the interval.
    num_processes = return the top N CPU consuming processes
    interval = the number of seconds to sample CPU usage over

    CLI Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' ps.top

        salt '*' ps.top 5 10
```
