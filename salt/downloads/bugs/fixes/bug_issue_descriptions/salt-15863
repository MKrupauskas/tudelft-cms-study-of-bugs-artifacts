probably because templates get parsed on the minion, when using the jinja `{% include "file.inc" %}`
i get an template error, because the include is not found.

as a workaround you need to deploy that file.inc as a requirement.

i'm not sure if this is expected behaviour, or an issue. but currently i'm tending to treat it as a bug, since it completely fails when using `test=True`.
