I have ubuntu 20.04 running on my machine and basically I just wanted to raise my hand and said I'd be willing to beta test salt on this. I would like to upgrade my servers rather sooner than later due to the built-in python3.8 which is gonna be just awesome for my company so I'm also eager to get salt up and running.

 I tried the `bionic` repo from https://repo.saltstack.com/#ubuntu and straight of, many or most of the `grains.items` were missing.
Either way - I would like to offer my testing capabilities but wasn't sure where to go with this other than write a ticket. Hope this is an okay place

Cheers
