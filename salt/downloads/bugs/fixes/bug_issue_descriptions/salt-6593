I have two keys that appear in both Accepted and Unaccepted.

The way I got into this situation was by forgetting to add a pattern to the autosign.conf and thus accumulating a few keys in unaccepted. Then adding this pattern to to autosign.conf. Next these keys were accepted but still listed under Unaccepted.

I restarted salt-master with no effect.

Not a big issue, I can deal with it myself but thought I'd report it case this is just the tip of the iceberg of a bigger problem.

Thanks.
