### Description of Issue/Question

The influxdb_user state can create two types of users, namely normal ones and cluster admins. The decision to create one or the other is based on the value of the "database" argument in that a cluster admin is created if no database is specified.

Unfortunately changes introduced in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/31787 which allowed this state to be used in influxdb 0.9 and later versions, only allow for the creation of "normal users" and not cluster admins.

It would be relatively straightforward to fix this and I simply wanted to ask before providing a PR if we want to provide support for InfluxDB 0.8 or if support for that could be dropped.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try to create a cluster admin user using `influxdb_user.present` by not setting the `database` argument.
