Certain state failures do not set `retcode` properly.  Consequently the master does not enumerate the minions as failed and summary information is incorrect.  This appears to be related to states that cause additional salt calls that instantiate new `__context__`.  The roll-up of child `__context__` to the parent `__context__` fails and then `__context__['retcode']` is incorrect.

It is notable that when the master _parses_ the return information for colorization that the failed states are correctly colorized due to state return structures correctly indicate the failure.  Unfortunately the overall success/failure is determined by reading `retcode` which is incorrect.  Consequently summary information provided by `-v --summary` is incorrect.  This can go unnoticed when visually scanning the output from a few minions, but when there are thousands of minions the summary information must be reliable.

Put the following contents in `junk/foo.sls`:

``` sls
#!jinja|yaml

foo:
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'true'
    - check_cmd:
      - 'false'
```

The following is expected output:

``` yaml
[root@orc1.ut1 ~]# salt -v --summary minion-a state.apply junk.foo

While `minion-a` shows a `Failed: 1` it does not show as a minion with errors.
