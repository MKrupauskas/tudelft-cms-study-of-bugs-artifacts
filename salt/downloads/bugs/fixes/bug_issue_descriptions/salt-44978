### Description of Issue/Question
No duration key is added to the return dictionary in some situations resulting in output like:

```
ID: sysctl-reload-cmd 
Function: cmd.run 
Name: /sbin/sysctl -p 
Result: True 
Comment: State was not run because none of the onchanges reqs changed 
Changes:
```

This causes inconsistent output. It appears that the `Duration` key is only added in the `call` method, so any state that does not result in an execution of this method will not have this key added. This appears to be specific to states, not the corresponding modules. 

### Setup
Install the salt-minion to ensure this state doesn't do anything, or execute this twice.

```
install_salt_again:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: salt-minion
  
restart_salt_minion:
  cmd.run:
    - name: service salt-minion restart
    - onchanges:
      - pkg: install_salt_again
```
