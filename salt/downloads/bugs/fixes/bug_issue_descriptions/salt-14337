Some recent changes (f1a8a538fca44365362e0d51c0ab37da425a0d2e) have made the "systemd" python module a requirement of salt. If it is not installed, it leads to the salt-master being terminated after a timeout.

Since  f1a8a538fca44365362e0d51c0ab37da425a0d2e , pkg/salt-master.service has the type "notify". This means that systemd waits for a notify signal that the service has been started. Unfortunately, this only works when the "systemd" python bindings are installed. If not, the salt-master will not notify systemd, which will cause a timeout and the termination of the salt-master.

The trouble is, that so far, the python systemd bindings are not available as a package for some distros (e.g. openSUSE).

I would suggest either to revert the service type to "simple", to add "python-systemd" to the requirements of the different packages (thus encouraging the packagers to also package python-systemd), or to include python-systemd into the salt code.
