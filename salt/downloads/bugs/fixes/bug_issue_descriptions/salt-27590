The carbon event returner doesn't seem to send any data back. 

A quick look at the code and logs shows that it doesn't find any metrics to send in the `_walk` function. 

I think the bug is https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners/carbon_return.py#L269 where we should replace `event['data'].get('data')` by `event['data']`
