I have a .json file with the following recurring content:

```
    "host_name": {
        "grains": {
            "fqdn_ip4": [
                "ip_address"
            ],
            "kernel": "kernel_name"
        },
        "pillars": {
            "key1": "",
            "key2": {
                "key3": "value3",
                "key4": {
                    "key5": {
                        "key6": "value5"
                    },
                    "key7": {
                        "key6": "value7"
                    },
                    "key8": {
                        "key6": "value8"
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The state file beginns with the following

```
{% import_json "formula_name/file_name.json" as pillar_ %}

{% for hostname in pillar_.iteritems() -%}
config_{{ hostname }}:
  file.managed:
    - name: 'path_name{{ hostname }}.conf'
    - user: root
.
.
.
```

When I call the state file I get this as output

```
  file.managed:
    - name: 'path_name(u'host_name', {u'pillars': {u'key1': u'', u'key2': {u'key3': u'value3', u'key4': {u'key5': {u'key6': u'value5'}, u'key7': {u'key6': u'value7'}, u'key8': {u'key6': u'value8'}, u'grains': {u'fqdn_ip4': [u'ip_addrress'], u'kernel': u'kernel_name'}}).conf'
    - user: root
```

and of course these errors:

```
expected <block end>, but found ','
```

If I am not mistaken I somehow import the python regular exprssion for unicode character classes? Is this a bug or do I have to change something?
