### Description of Issue/Question

Salt versions 2016.3.1 and earlier had Ubuntu 14.04 systems report "Ubuntu-14.04" in the osfinger grain. Salt-minion 2016.3.2 on a similar system will have just "Ubuntu-14" in the same grain.

A system administrator may quite often write jinja templates that check for an exact string in that grain. The change in the grain will require a large number of adjustments in the Jinja templates.
### Setup

No special setup needed. Just some Ubuntu 14.04 minions and a master to control them. My testing was done with the minion and master being the same system.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Install salt-minion 2016.3.2 on a system running Ubuntu 14.04.
- Run `salt -G osfinger:Ubuntu-14 grains.item saltversion`
