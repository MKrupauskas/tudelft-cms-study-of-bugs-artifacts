### Description of Issue/Question
Additional fixes for the NSIS installer to address situations where salt is run in a cmd window instead of as a service. If the user tries to update salt via `pkg.install salt-minion` the python processes are not killed and there are locked files. This keeps salt from updating needed files and leaves the installation in an unknown state.

This is what the installer needs to do:
- Check for running python processes (specifically `c:\salt\bin\python.exe`) and close those
- This check would need to account for salt being installed in alternate locations in the future, so maybe pull a registry entry to get the location of the salt python binary

This is a continuation of #40947
