### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup

Using module.run s3.put to place HTML files in an S3 bucket.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try using s3.put to place an object into an S3 bucket.
As s3.put has no header argument available the correct Content-Type will not be set, e.g. text/html
The default is binary/octet-stream and this is what is currently set for any objects created using s3.put
