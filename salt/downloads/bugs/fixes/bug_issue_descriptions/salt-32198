Since updating to 2015.8.8 I am unable to process pkg.installed states.
### Setup

``` sls
top.sls
base:
  '*':
    - test

test.sls
htop:
  pkg:
    - installed
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

highstate on above two sls files

``` yaml
OUTPUT:
    ID: htop
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
    Comment: State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'test'
              Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False
```
