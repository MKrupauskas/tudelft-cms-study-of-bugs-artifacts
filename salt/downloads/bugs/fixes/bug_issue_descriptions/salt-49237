### Description of Issue/Question
On most platforms, the `service.status` module returns either `True` or `False` depending on the status of a given service. But on MacOS, it returns `False` if the service isn't running, or a list of process IDs if the service is running. This makes it difficult to make platform-agnostic tools on top of Salt, since special consideration has to be made for Mac OS.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run `salt MACOS-MINION service.status servicename` against a running service
