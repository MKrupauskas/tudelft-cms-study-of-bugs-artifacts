### Description of Issue/Question

Ticket #23501 is not correctly fixed and should be reopened.
I filed a new ticket as I could not reopen that ticket. 

I think the merged fix from  9d0bb55a135a52d900f25ec  is not correct.

If  `force_conf_new: True` is given,  salt adds _both_ options: 
 `'-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confnew', '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef'`

As net effect apt-get will then _not_ use force-confnew, but force-confdef.

The following patch fixed the problem for me
```diff
diff --git a/salt/modules/aptpkg.py b/salt/modules/aptpkg.py
index 3a96d63..87ca989 100644

-        cmd_prefix += ['-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef']
+            cmd_prefix += ['-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef']
         if 'install_recommends' in kwargs:
             if not kwargs['install_recommends']:
                 cmd_prefix.append('--no-install-recommends')
```
That patch is not complete though..
The following code is wrong too  salt/modules/aptpkg.py
```python
 cmd.extend(['apt-get', '-q', '-y',
                '-o', 'DPkg::Options::={0}'.format(force_conf),
                '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef'])
```


The patch above is just to demonstrate the problem, a better fix is probably needed.
