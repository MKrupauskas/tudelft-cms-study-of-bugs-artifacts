system_site_packages is only taken into account when creating the virtualenv.

Subsequent runs of virtualenv.managed should inspect the virtualenv to see if system_site_packages matches the state of the virtualenv. If they do not match, it should either manually create/delete the site-packages symlink or destroy the virtualenv and recreate it with the appropriate flags.
