I attempted to use salt-cp in a code push script, invoked as follows:

salt-cp 'base-app*' /srv/salt/prod/PLATFORM.war /root/PLATFORM.war

This worked -- the first time.

Upon further observation, I discovered that it did not overwrite; nor was there an option to overwrite.

At that point, I did an "mv /root/PLATFORM.war /root/PLATFORM.war.previous' in my code push script, prior to the salt-cp.

The salt-cp did not copy the file over after that, even though there was no PLATFORM.war. 

In short: salt-cp appears to copy a file to a given minion once, and once only.
