On both 2014.7.0rc2 and the latest develop the I get the following error:

```

```

Here's my salt-cloud version:

```
root@boucha:~/salt# salt-cloud --version
salt-cloud 2014.7.0rc2 (Helium)
```

Some debugging shows that the return from ec2 is a dictionary whose main key is the minion name. I have a fix and a PR coming soon.

@techhat could you verify this is the correct fix?

Thanks!
