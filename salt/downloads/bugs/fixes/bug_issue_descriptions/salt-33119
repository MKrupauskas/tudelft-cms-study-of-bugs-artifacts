Because cache_dir isn't used for package removal, an uninstaller that needs a config file must rely on the install process having cached it, and the cache remaining intact. 

As an example for installing and uninstalling Microsoft Office:

> installer: 'salt://win/repo-ng/microsoft_office_professional_plus_2013/setup.exe'
> install_flags: '/adminfile full.msp'
> uninstaller: 'salt://win/repo-ng/microsoft_office_professional_plus_2013/setup.exe'
> uninstall_flags: '/uninstall ProPlus /config SilentUninstall.xml'
> cache_dir: True

Uninstallation will fail if 'SilentUninstall.xml' is not present. Since the directory is not cached again, this file may or may not exist when the uninstall process is run.

Tested on 2015.8.8-2.
