Given,

<pre>
# salt-ssh --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.7.0
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1

   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
        libnacl: Not Installed
         PyYAML: 3.10
          ioflo: Not Installed
          PyZMQ: 14.0.1
           RAET: Not Installed
            ZMQ: 4.0.4
           Mako: 0.9.1
</pre>


When I run state.sls

<pre>
# salt-ssh 'foo' state.sls avahi -lerror
Exception AttributeError: "'Terminal' object has no attribute 'pid'" in <bound method Terminal.__del__ of <salt.utils.vt.Terminal object at 0x7f0815eae510>> ignored
foo:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.sls: I/O operation on closed file
</pre>


running regular modules seems to work fine.

The avahi state that i have just installs a few packages and enables the services.

update: state.highstate also produces the same error for me. It looks like this is a regression and it may relate to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/19202
