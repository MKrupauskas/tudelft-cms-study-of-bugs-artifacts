Perhaps I'm missing somthing crit of why `pillar_opts` defaults to true,
I understand changing it might break some salt installes.. but please dont let that hold you back from progress.

From my pov:

the master exposes to much information to the minions like

```
        external_auth:
            pam:
                oat:
                      oat*:
                          - .*
                    - @runner
                s8weber:
                    - .*
                    - @wheel
                    - @runner
```

this might lead to possible attacks and wasted network traffic and cpu cycles.
it also looks messy when running pillar.items

Perhaps its helpfull in multi master setups?  but this is far from what most users will be using salt for.

Minions should not be using master config data, rather this should be set from pillars.
