**Description**
Looking at the docs, salt.states.user.present() appears to have dropped the gid_from_name parameter? My .sls file still included it and it took ages to figure out that that was causing a rendering failure

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Have a state with
```
user.present:
  - gid_from_name: True
```

**Expected behavior**
Error: "gid_from_name is not a valid parameter for user.present()"

**Screenshots**
```
[ERROR   ] JSON Render failed for: Execute a packaged state run, the packaged state run will exist in a
    tarball available locally. This packaged state
    can be generated using salt-ssh.
