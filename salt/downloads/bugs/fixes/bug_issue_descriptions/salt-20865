Or i could be wrong, but this is current issue i am having. 

This is the current directory structure we are using:

```
/srv/salt
  /state 
    top.sls
    states for roles of servers 
  /example-states
  /ext_module/
     /_modules
      /_states
      /_renderers
      /pillar
        *py
  /pillar/
```

in /etc/salt/master i have setup extension_modules as follows:

```
extension_modules: srv/salt/ext_module/
```

On the minion I have to setup the extension_modules as follows, which is different from how I understand from the documentation in the sall minion config page. 

```
extension_modules: ../ext_module/
```
