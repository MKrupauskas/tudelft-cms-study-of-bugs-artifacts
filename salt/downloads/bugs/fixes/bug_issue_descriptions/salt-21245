So I'm trying to debug why i can't bootsrap salt from a cloud deploy.  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/dff484cdfe2088fc33cd6a15b9b9ec5fdafb60d7/salt/utils/cloud.py#L700 seems to be where I'm stuck

I tried, from a command line, running
`winexe -U myadmin%MYPASSWORD //MY_IP "sc query winexesvc"` and get
`ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`
against a fresh windows 2012 R2 server.

Now when comparing a success windows event log to a successful RDP, the only difference I can see are these different NTLM options

example successful call from RDP:
`Detailed Authentication Information:
    Logon Process:      NtLmSsp 
    Authentication Package: NTLM
    Transited Services: -
    Package Name (NTLM only):   NTLM V2
    Key Length:     128`

The unsuccessful command 
`Detailed Authentication Information:
    Logon Process:      NtLmSsp 
    Authentication Package: NTLM
    Transited Services: -
    Package Name (NTLM only):   -
    Key Length:     0`

So I guess my larger question is, has anyone ever bootstrapped a salt-cloud deployed Windows 2012R2?
