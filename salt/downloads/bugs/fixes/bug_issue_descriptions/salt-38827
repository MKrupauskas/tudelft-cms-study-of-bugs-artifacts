### Syndic broken between 2016.3.3 and 2016.11.1
We recently tried to update our salt-master-of-masters to 2016.11.1. We have multiple syndic-masters running 2016.3.3 connected to it. After the update, the syndic functionality was broken. This was done during a scheduled maintenance, so I had to roll back the package and syndic functionality started working as expected. We have however been able to update syndic-masters to 2016.11.1 and they are able to function as expected when talking to the 2016.3.3 master of masters.

### Setup
Our master of masters was running salt-2016.11.1 with multiple 2016.3.3 syndic-masters connected to it.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run a salt master of masters with 2016.11.1 and have a syndic-master running 2016.3.3. The master of masters is unable to receive any return data from the syndic-master.

### Versions Report
Current state of master of masters:
