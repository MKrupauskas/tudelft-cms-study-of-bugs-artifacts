### Description of Issue/Question

When I apply a netconfig.managed state to a device with the commit=False parameter, the state will always report "Configuration changed" even though there are no changes, and the diff is empty. This appears to be caused by the code in salt.modules.napalm_network._config_logic() not handling the case where commit_config=False. 

### Setup
```
junos_common:
    netconfig.managed:
        - template_name: salt://junos/templates/junos.j2
        - debug: True
        - commit: False
        - watch_in:
            - module: junos_commit

junos_commit:
    module.wait:
        - name: net.commit
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply the state above that causes a change and see the commit execute. Then re-run the state, the commit should not execute, but it does because the netconfig.managed reports that things have changed. 

```

     Comment: Configuration changed!

              diff:
              loaded_config:
                  system { ...
```

I can work around this by inserting this check into the bottom of salt.modules.napalm_network._config_logic() to handle the missing case. 

```
    if not commit_config:
        if not len(loaded_result.get('diff', '')) > 0:
            loaded_result['already_configured'] = True
            loaded_result['comment'] = 'Already configured.'
```
