salt 2014.1.3

I am setting up client acls as documented here:

http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clientacl.html

By default, file permissions for /etc/salt/master are 640.

When i set up acls for a non-root user and then execute the salt command, I get this:

salt: error: Failed to load configuration: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/salt/master'

If I change permissions  /etc/salt/master to 644, then the non-root user can exec the command successfully.

UtahDave does not believe this should be required and asked me to open up this issue as a result.
