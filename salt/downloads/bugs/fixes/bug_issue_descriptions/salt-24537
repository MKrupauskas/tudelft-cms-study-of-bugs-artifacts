Given this alias definition in /etc/aliases:

```
root: user1
```

The following salt state doesn't work properly:

``` yaml
root: { alias.present: [ target: user ] }
```

It leaves the alias definition unchanged instead of updating it to `root: user`

Looking at the code, the last line of the has_target() function in modules/aliases.py seems to be the source of the problem:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/aliases.py#L152

It checks for `target in aliases[alias]` which will return true if target is 'user' and aliases[alias] is 'user1'.
