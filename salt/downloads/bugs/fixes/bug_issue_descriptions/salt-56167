### Description of Issue

Due to a bug [on this line](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/55540/files#diff-51f5a9819bcf2919b421cb7fccd2c42bR490), introduced by #55540 if you use `reload: whatever, True or False` on `service.running` states, you get a stacktrace and state fails.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Disable a service (say cron.service for example)
`systemctl disable cron.service`
2. Stop service
`systemctl stop cron.service`
3. Apply following state:
```
cron:
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - reload: False
```

**Expected behaviour (like salt 2019.2)**
```
       ----------
                 ID: cron
           Function: service.running
             Result: True
            Comment: Service cron has been enabled, and is running
            Started: 16:10:32.264708
           Duration: 749.571 ms
            Changes:   
              ----------
              cron:
                  True
```
On the minion:
```
* cron.service - Regular background program processing daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cron.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-02-14 16:10:32 UTC; 15min ago
```
Service is running and enabled.

**Observed behaviour:**
```
       [ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
         File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1981, in call

       TypeError: status() got an unexpected keyword argument 'reload'
       ----------
                 ID: bender
           Function: service.running
             Result: True
            Comment: Service bender has been enabled, and is running
            Started: 16:10:32.264708
           Duration: 749.571 ms
            Changes:   
              ----------
              bender:
                  True
```
On the minion:
```
* cron.service - Regular background program processing daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cron.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-02-14 16:10:32 UTC; 15min ago
```
Service is running, but not enabled despite summary say it has been enabled

## How tests can be improved to avoid future regression

Add a `service.running` test with `enable: True` and `reload: True`
