I've tested on the 2014.7, 2015.2, and develop branches.

The current behavior of `cp.push` and `cp.push_dir` is to skip an empty file and not upload it to the master's file cache without any indication that the file was skipped.

It seems to me that `cp.push` and `cp.push_dir` should upload all files correctly, including empty ones, so as to faithfully recreate the file or directory on the minion.

Was this just an oversight or is there a reason skipping empty files that I'm not seeing?
