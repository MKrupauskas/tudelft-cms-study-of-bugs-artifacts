I just installed salt cloud on a AWS node and I have it deploying other ec2 instances, unfortunately 
python-jinja and possible other rpms are not installing. Even though the package comes from salt the keys that sign the package do not match the published key.
Versions of salt cloud, salt cloud errors, yum errors in the gists below:
