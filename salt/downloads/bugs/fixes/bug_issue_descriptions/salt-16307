When running salt-call on the Helium rc2 system, it hangs after printing:

Run installing manually, I noticed that this is a package that has some debconf configuration. I would be willing to bet that this issue is caused by improper handling of debconf somewhere.

Also, I noticed this problem becuase one of my states didn't work after upgrading. Hopefully this should be easy to reproduce since it is stripped down to the minimum needed to cause the error. Also, both systems where launched specifically for testing this, and were otherwise clean.
