When a repo is configured with a mountpoint with a trailing slash, we fail to match any file paths in that repo. For example:

```
gitfs_remotes:
  - http://foo.com/bar.git:
    - mountpoint: salt://foobar/
```

Removing the trailing slash makes it work. Based off of what I remember about how I implemented this feature (without having gone and looked at the source to confirm), I think this is being caused by the fact that this is how we resolve mountpoints:
1. File `salt://foobar/baz.txt` is requested (as simply `foobar/baz.txt`, from the perspective of the fileserver backend... we normalize the mountpoint by stripping a leading `salt://` from it because the fileserver backends never see the `salt://` in the requested file paths).
2. The requested path begins with the mountpoint, so we know this repo is a potential candidate to match this file.
3. To check for a match in the repo, we strip the mountpoint, _plus one more character_ to represent the path separator.
4. Since the mountpoint, as stored in the GitProvider subclass instance, is `foobar/`, we strip `foobar/` plus the next character from the requested path, leaving `az.txt`.
5. This doesn't match, so Salt says it can't find the file.

I'll need to do more testing once I'm done with what I'm working on now to confirm, but I'm fairly certain of the cause and this should be a trivial fix.
