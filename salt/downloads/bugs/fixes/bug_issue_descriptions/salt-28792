I am using 2015.8.1 on openSUSE leap 42.1 from the packages provided in the default openSUSE 42.1 repo. It seems that pkg.installed is getting an error:

```
Nov 11 21:15:16 salt salt-minion[13037]: [ERROR   ] State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'common'
Nov 11 21:15:16 salt salt-minion[13037]: Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False
```

Here's the full minion log:
