I am receiving the following in my master log file whenever I attempt to highstate a host (which fails).

```
2014-03-05 09:57:11,089 [salt.master                                 ][ERROR   ] Error in function _serve_file:

```

Running salt-run fileserver.update does nor error, and salt-call cp.list_states correctly lists all states (all my states are in gitfs). Running salt-call state.show_top however will cause the issue to occur which fails with:

```
# salt-call state.show_top
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
Passed invalid arguments: string indices must be integers, not str
```

Which is the same error as highstate and show_highstate.
