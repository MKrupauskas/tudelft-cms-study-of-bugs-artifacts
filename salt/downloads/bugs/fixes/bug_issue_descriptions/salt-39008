### Description of Issue/Question
using import_yaml in pillars is broken on the develop branch
git bisect shows https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/bd12f7
works fine on 2016.11.1
problem is the same on both python2 and python3

a workaround is to remove "if rend is None" at pillar/__init__.py and replace it with "if True"...

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
```
