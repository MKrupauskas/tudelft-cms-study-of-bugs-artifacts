### Description of Issue/Question
Passing a `password` and `empty_password=True` to `states.user.present` causes a `KeyError` due to a lookup for `user.chpasswd` module func which doesn't exist.

### Setup
Even though it was a mistake on my part a simple state file which pushes a single user like so,
```yaml
saltvirt:                    
  user.present:              
    - fullname: saltvirt user
    - shell: /bin/bash       
    - home: /home/saltvirt   
    - empty_password: True   
    - password: virty        
    - groups:                
      - wheel                
```
causes a `KeyError`:

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```bash
salt-call --local state.sls salt_virt/users -l debug
local:
----------
          ID: saltvirt
    Function: user.present
      Result: False

I'm running off the `develop` branch : `Salt: 2016.11.0-890-g98b648d`
I have a simple fix I'll put up a PR shortly.
