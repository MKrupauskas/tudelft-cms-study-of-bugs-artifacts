### Description of Issue/Question

Running a new minion that gets rejected because of an existing key doesn't fail the `salt-call state.highstate` command

### Setup

- Create a minion
- Create another minion with the same `/etc/salt/minion_id`
- Run `salt-call state.highstate --retcode-passthrough` on the latter

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
ubuntu@ip-10-0-2-101:~$ salt-call --version

ubuntu@ip-10-0-2-101:~$ sudo salt-call --force-color state.highstate -l debug --retcode-passthrough

[CRITICAL] The Salt Master has rejected this minion's public key!
To repair this issue, delete the public key for this minion on the Salt Master and restart this minion.
Or restart the Salt Master in open mode to clean out the keys. The Salt Minion will now exit.
