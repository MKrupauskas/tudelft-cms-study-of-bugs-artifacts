The problem occurs when trying to add a registry key to a Windows 64bit machine. 
Example from SLS file:

This key would be added in the "WOW6432Node" path instead of the one specified in the SLS file. There doesn't seem to be a way to force it to the 32bit path, which Windows actually uses for the auto-login. 

There should be a method of forcing the path to be registry key so that it doesn't get added to the WOW6432Node instead. 

Tagging @UtahDave , as per recommendation from IRC forum. 

Thanks
