### Description of Issue/Question
Not sure if this is intentional, but values passed as environment variables to cmd.run or cmd.script fail if they are not strings.

```
TypeError: execve() arg 3 contains a non-string value
```
In my specific case, I'm using variables from pillar, some which are numbers, and passing them as environment variables to scripts. Since I can set numbers as environment variables in a linux shell, I figured I would be able to do the same with salt.

Obviously this can be worked around by quoting values, but I'm reporting this as I thought it was misleading.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

pillar/config.sls:
```
test-value: 5000
```

salt/test.sls
```
test-state:
  cmd.run:
    - name: |
        echo "Hi: ${BLAH}"
    - env:
      - BLAH: {{pillar['test-value']}}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Using the example pillar and state files above:
```
salt-call --local state.apply test
```
