The behavior I'm looking for is that no action is taken if the parent directory doesn't exist.  No matter what approach I seem to take, file.managed will create the directories and file despite what I read in documentation: "If the file is located in a path without a parent directory, then the state will fail. If makedirs is set to True, then the parent directories will be created to facilitate the creation of the named file."

Here is my sls:

```
include:
  - 7zip

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\mozilla.cfg:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://STIG/mozilla.cfg
    - makedirs: False

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref\local-settings.js:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://STIG/mozilla-local-settings.js
    - makedirs: False

dod-unzip-extension:
  cmd.run:
    - name: '"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z" x -o"C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox
\distribution\bundles\dod" D:\srv\salt\file_roots\STIG\dod_configuration-1.3.6.xpi -y > NUL'
    - quiet:
    - unless: 'dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\bundles\dod"'
    - onlyif: 'dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox"'
    - require:
      - pkg: 7zip
```

cmd.run will not run unless parent exists and is working as expected.
