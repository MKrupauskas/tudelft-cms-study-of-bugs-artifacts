This is a really weird problem and something I've usually only seen with cronjobs when an interactive shell is required but unavailable due to the nature of cron.

I have the following call that I execute as a part of a script that sits in a cronjob run by root:

```
/usr/bin/salt-call network.interfaces --output json --log-level=quiet --local
```

This call produces valid output when called interactively in a normal shell as root but produces nothing when the same call is made from within a cronjob.

```
non-interactive cronjob output:

*/6 * * * * /usr/bin/salt-call network.interfaces --output json --log-level=quiet --local > /tmp/salty.log


# cat /tmp/salty.log 
{
    "local": {}
}

interactive shell output:
# /usr/bin/salt-call network.interfaces --output json --log-level=quiet --local
{
    "local": {
        "lo": {
            "hwaddr": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
            "up": true,
            "inet": [
                {  
                    "broadcast": null,
                    "netmask": "255.0.0.0",
                    "label": "lo",
                    "address": "127.0.0.1"
                }  
            ],     
            "inet6": [
                {  
                    "prefixlen": "128",
                    "address": "::1"
                }  
            ]      
        },         
        "em2": {   
            "hwaddr": "78:2b:cb:50:b3:3b",
            "up": false
        },         
        "em4": {   
            "hwaddr": "78:2b:cb:50:b3:3f",
            "up": false
        },         
        "em1": {   
            "hwaddr": "78:2b:cb:50:b3:39",
            "up": false
        },         
        "em3": {   
            "hwaddr": "78:2b:cb:50:b3:3d",
            "up": false
        },         
<snip> ips / bonds removed </snip>
    }              
}

```

I haven't made any substantive changes to this shell script or call but this script broke upon upgrading to v.17. Is this a bug? Or is there some other way I can poll and pull networking information out? I need mac-addresses, interface names (virtual and physical) and IPs.

Thanks.
