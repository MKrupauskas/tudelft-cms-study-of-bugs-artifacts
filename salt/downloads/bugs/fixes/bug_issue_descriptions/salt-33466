### Description of Issue/Question

Minions that have been stopped and are reported as offline are still being reported as being present by the presence event system.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Accept a minion and turn on presence events by setting `presence_events: True` in the master config. Wait for minion to be reported as being present in the `salt/presence/present`. Once the minion has been listed as being present it is stopped and `salt-run manage.down` is being executed.

The expectation would have been that the minion is no longer included in the list of present minions, but reported as `lost` in the `salt/presence/change` event. We do, however, see the following events:

```
salt/presence/present   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:17.751376", 
    "present": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ]
}
salt/run/20160524111929009590/new   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:29.232977", 
    "fun": "runner.manage.down", 
    "jid": "20160524111929009590", 
    "user": "sudo_vagrant"
}
20160524111929250961    {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:29.251123", 
    "minions": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ]
}
salt/job/20160524111929250961/new   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:29.251205", 
    "arg": [], 
    "fun": "test.ping", 
    "jid": "20160524111929250961", 
    "minions": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ], 
    "tgt": "*", 
    "tgt_type": "glob", 
    "user": "sudo_vagrant"
}
20160524111934259366    {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:34.259689", 
    "minions": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ]
}
salt/job/20160524111934259366/new   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:34.260658", 
    "arg": [
        "20160524111929250961"
    ], 
    "fun": "saltutil.find_job", 
    "jid": "20160524111934259366", 
    "minions": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ], 
    "tgt": "*", 
    "tgt_type": "glob", 
    "user": "sudo_vagrant"
}
salt/run/20160524111929009590/ret   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:19:44.326068", 
    "fun": "runner.manage.down", 
    "jid": "20160524111929009590", 
    "return": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ], 
    "success": true, 
    "user": "sudo_vagrant"
}
salt/presence/present   {
    "_stamp": "2016-05-24T09:20:18.015483", 
    "present": [
        "salttest-debian-jessie.test"
    ]
}
```

where the minion is obviously being reported as being down, but still included in the `present` list of the `salt/presence/present` event. Conversely no `salt/presence/change` event has been fired.
