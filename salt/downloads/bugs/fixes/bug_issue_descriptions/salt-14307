Hello,

I decided to file a bug now so that there is a single place for me and people from 
# salt to gather their information regarding this issue.

This morning one of my colleagues installed a new minion somewhere which got him .7 even though our master was running .5. I thought that the issue would have been fixed easily by upgrading the master to .7 and we also decided to give the master more cores (1 core upgraded to 12) and RAM (1G to 4G). This necessitated a reboot of the master and I can't get the minions to talk to the master ever since.

Here is what I have tried:

```
