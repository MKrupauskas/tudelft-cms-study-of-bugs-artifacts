After specifying ipv6: True on both, master and minion, and setting the master to listen on "::" connections are present and I am able to accept keys from IPv6 (and IPv4) hosts.
But as soon as I am running a salt command to be executed on a IPv4 or IPv6 host, the following error is thrown:

``` pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):

Exception AttributeError: "'SREQ' object has no attribute 'poller'" in <bound method SREQ.__del__ of <salt.payload.SREQ object at 0x1908a90>> ignored
```

I suspect ip_bracket() is not called on the IP at some point, but I actually do not know for sure.
I am using 0.15.3 on all hosts.
