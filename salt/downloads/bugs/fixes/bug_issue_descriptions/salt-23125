Hi all,
Since the local job cache is just too slow(even for only 50 Minions) I wanted to use Elasticsearch as master_job_cache. But I can't get the thing working. Configuration and error message when running a `salt\* test.ping` can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/bemeyert/ab3d0567d953d154a9d4). Salt version is 2014.7.5, OS is CentOS 6, Elasticsearch-py has version 1.4.
This might be a duplicate of #20826

Cheers
