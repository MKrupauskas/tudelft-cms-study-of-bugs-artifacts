### Description of Issue/Question
Upgrading salt-minion from 2016.11.2 to 2018.3.2 have always been failing a bit randomly (~50%), with high probability the minion entering a running but non-responding state, logging

```
Simply restarting the minion resolves the problem (and magically making yaml_jinja present again). (But the restart takes a visibly longer time, like 30 seconds.) I have tried to install python3 jinja and yaml before upgrading minion (it's just hand-waving since the package does that anyway) but didn't help.

(Tried to search issues, found nothing relevant.)

### Setup
Debian jessie and stretch mixed; master is either 2016.11 or 2018.3, both fails the same. (2018 is from the official salt repo, 2016 is from Debian repo.)

Multimaster, but I don't think it's relevant.
(As a sidenote upgrade "always" fail when ipv6:True and the masters only have ipv4 addresses. It's been working before but I'm not sure whether it's a bug or a feature.)

Minion config:
```
/etc/salt/minion.d/proxy.conf:proxy_host: proxy.x.y
/etc/salt/minion.d/proxy.conf:proxy_port: 3128
/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf:schedule:
/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf:  __mine_interval: {enabled: true, function: mine.update, jid_include: true, maxrunning: 2,
/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf:    minutes: 60, return_job: false}
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:master: 
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:  - salt2.x.y
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:  - salt1.x.y
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:master_tries: -1
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:#damnyou# ipv6:true 
/etc/salt/minion.d/l.conf:grains:

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```yaml
{% if pillar['salt-official-latest'] is defined %}
update-salt-official-latest:
  pkg.latest:
    - pkgs:
      - salt-minion
      - salt-common
    - cache_valid_time: 600
    - install_recommends: True
    - only_upgrade: True
    - require:
      - pkg: salt-required-other-pkgs

restart-when-updated-official:
  service.running:
    - name: salt-minion
    - watch: 
      - pkg: update-salt-official-latest
{% endif %}   

# salt require these
salt-required-other-pkgs:
  pkg.latest:
    - pkgs:
{% if pillar['salt-official-latest'] is defined %}
      - python3-jinja2
      - python3-yaml
      - python3-apt
{% else %}
      - python-apt
{% endif %}      
```
