### Description of Issue/Question

In order to build servers using different profiles, CloudClient needs to get called repeatedly.  I would think that CloudClient should only need to get called once.

### Setup
I have a salt-master setup with a Rackspace Cloud account.  I am able to build servers with the cli tools without any issues.  

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
>>> import salt.cloud                                                              
>>> import salt.client                                                             
>>> import salt.config                                                             
>>> import salt.wheel    
>>> client = salt.cloud.CloudClient(path='/etc/salt/cloud')

>>> client.profile('c6-gp1', names=['ben.test.6-1',])
---output of a successful build---

>>> client.profile('c6-gp1', names=['ben.test.6-2',])                                                                  
---output of a successful build---

>>> client.profile('c7-gp1', names=['ben.test.7-1',])                                                                  
{'Error': 'Profile c7-gp1 is not defined'}

>>> client.profile('c6-gp1', names=['ben.test.6-3',])                                                                  
{'Error': 'Profile c6-gp1 is not defined'}

>>> client = salt.cloud.CloudClient(path='/etc/salt/cloud')
                                                            
>>> client.profile('c7-gp1', names=['ben.test.7-1',])                                                                  
---output of a successful build---

>>> client.profile('c6-gp1', names=['ben.test.6-3',])                                                                  
{'Error': 'Profile c6-gp1 is not defined'}
>>> client.profile('c7-gp1', names=['ben.test.7-2',])
{'Error': 'Profile c7-gp1 is not defined'}
```
Output trimmed and some spacing added for readability.
