It looks like it will install the package, but when salt goes back and makes sure that the latest version is installed, it does not take into account that a version may have an epoch that is not displayed by yum for some reason.

The quickest example is for libguestfs-tools, which has an epoch of 1.

```

    Function: pkg.latest
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to update: libguestfs-tools The following packages were already up-to-date: openstack-nova-compute, sysfsutils

              libguestfs-tools:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      1.28.1-1.55.el7.centos
                  old:
```

[root@novacompute01 ~]# yum list installed | grep libguestfs-tools
libguestfs-tools.noarch              1:1.28.1-1.55.el7.centos @base
libguestfs-tools-c.x86_64            1:1.28.1-1.55.el7.centos @base

So the versions do not match, because the version displayed when installing is without the epoch.
