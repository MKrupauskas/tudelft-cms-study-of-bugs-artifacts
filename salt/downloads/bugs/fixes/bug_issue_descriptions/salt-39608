### Description of Issue/Question
The x509.certificate_managed state doesn't work when it's configured to handle it's own private key as [explained in the docs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.x509.html#salt.states.x509.certificate_managed) or [shown in the example](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.x509.html#module-salt.states.x509) and it's not existing yet


### Setup

```SLS
# self signed cert
/etc/nginx/certs/localhost.cert.pem:
  x509.certificate_managed:
    - signing_private_key: /etc/nginx/private/localhost.key.pem
    - CN: localhost
    - days_valid: 365
    - days_remaining: 90
    - managed_private_key:
       name: /etc/nginx/private/localhost.key.pem
       bits: 2048
    - require:
       - pkg: python-m2crypto
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. configure state as shown above
2. make sure key file doesn't exist, but path is writable
3. and apply state.

```
         ID: /etc/nginx/certs/localhost.cert.pem
    Function: x509.certificate_managed
      Result: False
