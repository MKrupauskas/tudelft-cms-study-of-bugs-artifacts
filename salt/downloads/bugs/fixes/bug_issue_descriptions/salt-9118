Salt 0.17.2 & Salt-Cloud 0.8.11

because the windows installer overrides the file `C:\salt\conf\minion` (see #9117)
when salt-cloud creates a new windows instance it first copy the minion config file and then installs the minion service which is causing the loss of the minion config salt-cloud put there in the first place

for example:

```
windows:
  provider: someprovider
  image: ami-XXXXXX
  size: m1.xlarge
  securitygroup: somegroup
  minion:
    master: MASTERIP
    win_repo_cachefile: 'salt://win-pkgs/winrepo.p'
    grains:
      roles:
        - webserver
  win_installer: /srv/salt/Salt-Minion-0.17.2-AMD64-Setup.exe
  win_username: Administrator
  win_password: 'somepass'
```

the `win_repo_cachefile` won't appear in `C:\salt\conf\minion` 

I've opened an issue (#9117) about the windows installer issue, but this could be handled already from salt-cloud. this is my [suggestion](https://github.com/ranl/salt/commit/fc71dc5bb29e41ad1f5ee9bad7af162d9c2c82f4)
should I open a PR regarding this commit ?

in any case even when I've applied the commit above in my installation I've noticed that all the default configuration for windows doesn't come by-default from salt-cloud

for example (there might be more that I'm missing):

```
ipc_mode: tcp
root_dir: 'c:\salt'
pki_dir: /conf/pki/minion
multiprocessing: False
```

which causing the windows minion to not operate at all ...
