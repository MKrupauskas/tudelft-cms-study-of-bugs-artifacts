I'm chasing using Orchestrate-over-SSH, and it looks like `salt/states/saltmod.py` is using the incorrect return dict structure:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/states/saltmod.py#L249

In the above error, changing L249 (and all `'ret:'` entries in saltmod) allows an orchestration-over-ssh to complete normally.
