It's not possible to use a key file to deploy Salt on a minion. Only SSH password access is enabled, and the creation of an instance fails if ssh_password is not present. It'd be good to have an ssh_keyfile like for other cloud providers.

Also, ssh_username, ssh_password and media_link need to be in the profile, and can't be taken from the provider configuration. Is this a design decision? I'd like to have the same credentials for all instances and declare it in the provider configuration, in the same way it's done for EC2.

Many thanks.
