### Description of Issue/Question
When retrieving values from the SNMP configuration `win_snmp` always retrieves values from the registry which is not correct. Windows allows configuring the daemon through the service agent and through group policy, in my case local group policy. 

The problem comes when you configure the agent as above and then query the settings with `salt '<target minion>' win_snmp.get_community_names`. Even though the agent settings have been overwritten by the group policy Salt still returns the original configured community name pulling it directly from a registry setting. 

### Setup

1. Enable the SNMP service in Windows Server manager [Instructions here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/324263/how-to-configure-the-simple-network-management-protocol-snmp-service-i)
2. Follow above instructions to configure a community string
3. Configure a new community string through group policy 
4. Check the agent settings through the windows service manager
  * These should now read the new community string set through group policy
  * May require a `gpupdate /force` from powershell to update immediately
5. Query the community name with the command provided above
  * This will return the originally configured community string set manually through the agent configuration
