### Description of Issue/Question
The schedule only runs the jobs on the startup of the salt master.  I have a suspicions that this also happens on the minion, but haven't checked.  It runs once when the schedule gets started, and doesn't run after that.  For some runners, it doesn't run at all.

Reverting #39527 remedies the problem

### Setup
```
schedule:
  job1:
    function: test.stdout_print
    minutes: 1
```

Start the master and look for lines like this 

```
2017-03-14 19:37:18,895 [salt.utils.schedule                      ][INFO    ][4985] Running scheduled job: job1
2017-03-14 19:37:18,895 [salt.utils.schedule                      ][DEBUG   ][4985] schedule: This job was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)
