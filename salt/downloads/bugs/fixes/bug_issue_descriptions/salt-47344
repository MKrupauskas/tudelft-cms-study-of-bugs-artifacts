I'm running off a git checkout of the 2018.3 branch.

I have this state:

```
/etc/motd:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ pillar.get('motd', '') | json }}
```

```
          ID: /etc/motd
    Function: file.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/var/tmp/.salt_08831c_salt/py3/salt/state.py", line 1905, in call

Looking briefly at the code in question, it looks like the `ret` variable is only set inside of an if statement which might not always be true, but I wasn't able to figure out what the purpose of it was, so I couldn't submit a PR.
