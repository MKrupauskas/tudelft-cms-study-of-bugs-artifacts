In the Windows file system, the security descriptor information is irrespective of an optional discretionary access control list (DACL).  To change the owner or group, one must change the information in the security descriptor, outside of the DACL.

See here for details:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379561%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

 I am working on fixing this, and will submit a pull request when finished with it.
