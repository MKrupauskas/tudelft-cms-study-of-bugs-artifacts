### Description of Issue/Question

Configuring the network on CentOS 7.2 via `network.manage` causes minion to stop responding. It won't respond to e.g. `salt 'minion' test.ping` or anything. The `salt-minion` service requires a manual restart.

The minion does receive its new network settings and these settings are activated just fine. I can see how the minion is available on a new IP address and I can SSH into the minion to verify that all the settings has been applied properly.

However, the minion doesn't re-establish contact with the salt-master.

~~I assume there's no way to use `network.managed` and not have the configuration applied, and instead require e.g. a reboot to make them go into effect?~~Â In the development branch, the [network.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/network.py) offers the `- noifupdown: True` option, which helps me workaround this issue, as I can then decide myself when to e.g. reboot and make the changes go into effect.
### Setup

``` yaml
# /etc/salt/master

worker_threads: 80
```

``` yaml
# /srv/salt/centos/network/init.sls

{{ interface }}:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: eth
    - proto: none
    - ipaddr: {{ ip_addr }}
    - netmask: {{ netmask }}
    - gateway: 192.168.0.1
    - dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 8.8.4.4
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt 'minion' state.apply centos.network -t 120
```

or 

```
salt 'minion' state.highstate -t 120
```

both results in:

```
Minion did not return. [No response]
```
