### Description of Issue/Question

In a state file with _user.present_ and _empty_password: True_ the password is always set when running salt, even if it is already present and salt reports that it did nothing. You can see it on the server in the log line:

`passwd[11111]: password for 'casselt' changed by 'root'`

The worst thing about this is that it also removes the password if run with _test=True_, so I removed the passwords of all users on one server by accident. Just glad that I did not run _salt '*'â€¦_

### Setup

```
 casselt:
     user.present:
         - uid: 1111
         - gid: 100
         - shell: /bin/bash
         - empty_password: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Create state file with content above
2. Run `salt 'testserver*' state.sls teststate test=False` to create the user
3. Run `salt 'testserver*' state.sls teststate test=True` and look into `journalctl -r` to see the log lines mentioned above
4. Run `salt 'testserver*' state.sls teststate test=False` and look into `journalctl -r` to see the log lines mentioned above

Output of the second and third salt run should be:
```
----------
          ID: casselt
    Function: user.present
      Result: True
     Comment: User casselt is present and up to date
     Started: 08:00:28.640981
    Duration: 13.352 ms
     Changes:
----------
```

### Workaround ###

Workaround is to just use _password: ""_ instead of _empty_password: True_.
