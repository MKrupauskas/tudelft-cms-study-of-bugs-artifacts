### publish.full_data

We've just upgraded from Salt 0.14 to Salt 0.15.3 on Ubuntu; it says in the [release notes](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/releases/0.15.0.html#peer-system-updates) that the peer system has been improved.

Peer Publish Config:

```
peer:
  .*:
    - test.ping
  stage:
    - state.highstate
    - state.sls
```

It worked previously; now we are getting timeouts:

```
root@stage:~# salt-call publish.full_data --out json 'app-*' state.sls vhosts.some_vhost
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Publishing 'state.sls' to tcp://192.168.142.76:4506
{
    "local": "'state.sls' publish timed out"
}
```

`app-*` should match two nodes. `test.ping` works, but it sometimes only returns the result from a single node, instead of both:

```
root@stage:~# sudo salt-call publish.full_data --out json 'app-*' test.ping
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Publishing 'test.ping' to tcp://192.168.142.76:4506
{
    "app-01": {
        "jid": "20130625144941122345",
        "retcode": 0,
        "success": true,
        "cmd": "_return",
        "ret": true,
        "fun": "test.ping",
        "id": "app-01"
    },
    "__jid__": "20130625144941122345"
}
```
### side-effects on master

After a timed-out peer run, if I try to run the command directly from master, I get a cryptic error:

```
root@core:~# salt 'app-*' state.sls vhosts.appthemes_com
app-01:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.sls" is running as PID 26303 and was started at 2013, Jun 25 13:37:54.498798 with jid 20130625133754498798
```
