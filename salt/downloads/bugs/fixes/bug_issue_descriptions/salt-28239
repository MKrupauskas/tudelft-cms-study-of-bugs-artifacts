I installed the `python-pip` package before trying to use any pip states. However, when trying to run any pip.installed states I get the error:

> "An importable pip module is required but could not be found on your system. This usually means that the systems pip package is not installed properly"

I can login to the minion, fire up python, and do `import pip` and `import pip.req` without any issue. Doing `pip install -U pip` fixes the issue.

This issue didn't come up on 2015.5 and it didn't occur on any servers I updated from 2015.5 to 2015.8.
