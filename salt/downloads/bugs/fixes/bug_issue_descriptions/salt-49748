### Description of Issue/Question

Use-case:
1. Move a pre-packaged configuration of software package-x to package-x.conf.example
2. Place my own package-x.conf there instead

Works correct for the first run, when package-x.conf.example doesn't exist yet.
Fails on consecutive runs, because package-x.conf.example already exists.

Using 'force=True' is not an option, because after the second state.apply, the packaged version would be lost.

Shouldn't the file.rename report a "success, renamed file already in correct state" instead of a failure when force is not used?

Misunderstanding?  Or am I doing something non-idiomatic here and there's a better way?

### Setup
```
# Backup distro provided config as example
/etc/package-x/package-x.conf.example:
    file.rename:
        - source: /etc/package-x/package-x.conf

# Push our own config up there
/etc/package-x/package-x.conf:
    file.managed:
        - source: salt://roles/package-x/package-x.conf
        - user: root
        - group: root
        - mode: 644
```
