### Description of Issue/Question

I want to use the `pillar_raise_on_missing` option with salt-ssh, but it gets ignored.

Due to #40534 all configs with `pillar` in the name are ignored when the opts are passed to the ssh minion. Therefore I tried to use this option in the master config, but I think `salt-ssh` never passes the master config opts to `salt-call` (I looked in the `/var/tmp/....._salt` directory but could find only the minion config, but no master config). The docs state that this option should be available in the master and minion config.

### Setup
excerpt of `master` file passed to `salt-ssh`:
```
ssh_minion_opts:
  mysql.host: ...
  mysql.pass: ...
  pillar_raise_on_missing: True
pillar_raise_on_missing: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use `salt-ssh` with the config file as above and include a `{{ salt['pillar.get']('does_not_exist') }}` in a state file. An exception should be raised.
