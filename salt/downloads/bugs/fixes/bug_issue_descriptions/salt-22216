```
git+https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider.git#1.6.5:
  npm.installed:
    - user: me
    - dir: /home/me/node_modules
```

Fails to see when /home/me/node_modules already contains strider, or lacks a means of comparing what's installed to what's about to be cloned.  The result is that git-sourced packages always reinstall.
