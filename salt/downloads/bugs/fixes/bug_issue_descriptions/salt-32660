### Description of Issue/Question

bootstrap-salt.sh fails due to expired epel link: "http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/${EPEL_ARCH}/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm"

New version is epel-release-7-6.noarch.rpm; thus, the link should be updated to:
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/${EPEL_ARCH}/e/epel-release-7-6.noarch.rpm
