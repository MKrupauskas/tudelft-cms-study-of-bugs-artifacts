Since the regkey bug was fixed I can now get it to create me a local user on my Windows server.
 Although, I have noticed that it will not maintain/enforce the password after that.

 snippet:
 pault:
   user.present:
     - createhome: true
     - fullname:  "pault Account"
     - password: 'Password2Q!'
     - home: 'c:\Users\pault'
     - groups:
       - Users
       - Remote Desktop Users

 I've tried changing the password to various strings and it doesn't make any difference on the server when I RDP in it's still using the original password I set.
 I've tried it with and without the ' but nothing seems to make a difference.
