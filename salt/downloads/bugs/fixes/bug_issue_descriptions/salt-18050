I noticed a weird behavior of the command 
salt -v '*' test.ping 

ran from Salt master where it is accepted approximately 300 of minions. The Salt master has set worker threads to 100.
Salt masters versions report:

```
salt --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.1.7
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Sep  4 2013, 07:46:00)

Output of the command:

This block of responses  is still repeating and the command does never return. 
When I try to run test.ping directly against any of those minions (from the block above) it returns successfully:

```
salt CAD-xxxxxBxxx01-xxxxxxxx-and-golden-01-XXXXf7d5 test.ping
CAD-xxxxxBxxx01-xxxxxxxx-and-golden-01-XXXXf7d5:
   True
```

The minions are running on version <= 2014.1.7. They are a mixture of Windows and Linux minions. I can't estimate how many minions are not running at the moment of the test but this IMHO shouldn't affect test.ping function behavior. 

I performed one more test.ping test where I loop through all the accepted minions, one by one. It finally ends successfully on all minions (either pingable or 'did not return' but not infinite loop):

```
for id in $(salt-key -l acc | cut -d' ' -f6 ); do salt -v $id test.ping; done

Can anybody try to explain me what may going on under the hood?
