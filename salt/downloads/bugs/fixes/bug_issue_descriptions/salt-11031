First off, I have a really hard time reproducing this problem, but I'll try and describe it as detailed as possible.

First of, as long as the minions aren't doing anything, they are running ( and waiting for jobs ) just fine. They don't loose connectivity or die/shutdown out of nowhere. But some times ( not every time ), apparently after a job execution, they will die/close/shutdown. But not on all jobs and it seems a bit randomly on which they are doing it. This is, for now, a rather simple setup. One master, 15-20 minions and just 3 states at the moment ( all 3 states is using file.recurse to keep 3 dir's sync'ed ). Typically the procedure is invoked with first a: state.highstate ( keep dir's synced ) and then 2-3 cmd.run afterwards ( running a couple of scripts ). And that's it. It seems that the minion dies after the state.highstate, but not 100% sure ( more info below ) - and not every time.

I have enabled `log_level_logfile: debug` on the minion, and the last line in the log when the minion dies is every single time:

```
[salt.minion][INFO] Returning information for job: 20140306081...
```

( I have removed a bit of white spaces from the log line )

And the lines before that, is INFO with all three `Executing state file.recurse...` - so it seems like it's after a `state.highstate` that the minion is dying. But file.recurse is running just fine it seems.

On the master, the debug is a bit trickier but I have tried running the salt command with: `--log-level=debug --timeout=60` and log the output. And it seems like it works fine, reporting the 3 directories is up to date and at the bottom of the output:

```
Summary
------------
Succeeded: 3
Failed:    0
------------
Total:     3
```

I'm at the moment at a complete loss. I can't find any evidence that something fails somewhere ( other than the minion disappearing ) and I am not really sure where to go from here :/ I am more than happy to provide more info, tests etc. - but some pointers in where to go from here would be highly appreciated :)

From the master:

```
# salt --versions-report
Salt: 0.17.5
Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar  6 2014, 09:56:11)
Jinja2: 2.7.1

msgpack-pure: Not Installed
pycrypto: 2.6.1
PyYAML: 3.10
PyZMQ: 14.0.1
ZMQ: 4.0.3
```

From one of the minions ( some of them is running 0.17.4, some 0.17.5, not sure if it's an issue on 0.17.4 - but definitely on 0.17.5 minions ):

```
