This line can cause an UnboundLocalError if a line is returned without a colon, ie:

```
Sent message type=method_call sender=n/a destination=org.freedesktop.DBus object=/org/freedesktop/DBus interface=org.freedesktop.DBus member=Hello cookie=1 reply_cookie=0 error=n/a
```

This line will split into only one list entry leaving the len of that entry to = 1 leaving cur_param unset.
