### Description of Issue/Question

When running `state.high` over salt-ssh I receive the following error: `An Exception occurred while executing state.high: 'function' object has no attribute 'iteritems'`
### Setup
1. (1) salt-ssh master (1) host without salt setup in roster
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. run state.high command which was copied directly from the docs:

```
root@ubuntu:~# salt-ssh '*' state.high '{"vim": {"pkg": ["installed"]}}'
ch3ll-ssh-test:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.high: 'function' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
ch3ll-ssh-test2:
    An Exception occurred while executing state.high: 'function' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

This command works when not run over salt-ssh:

```
root@ubuntu:~# salt '*' state.high '{"vim": {"pkg": ["installed"]}}'
