### Description of Issue/Question

As has been dealt with in a few different issues, EPEL recently changed from Python 3.4 to Python 3.6. Salt packages have been updated, and new installs of Salt using PY3 instructions [here](https://repo.saltstack.com/#rhel) work.

However, pygit2 is not provided by EPEL or salt-py3-repo for Python 3.6. Additionally, the Python 3.6 version of Salt installed by salt-py3-repo on CentOS 7 specifies an interpreter of `#!/usr/bin/python3.6 -s`. The `-s` argument avoids loading the user's site directory to syspath and as such, using pip to install pygit2 for Python 3.6 will not work.

It seems that salt-py3-repo should provide a python36-pygit2 package as it does some other python36-* packages, or the `-s` argument should be removed so that users can install required packages not provided by the repositories.

### Setup
- Bring up a clean install of CentOS 7
- Install EPEL following the instructions [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)
- Install the latest salt-master release (2019.2.0 as of this report) using the instructions for "Redhat / CentOS 7 PY3" [here](https://repo.saltstack.com/#rhel) 
- Install pip for Python 3.6 (`yum install python36-pip`)
- Install pygit2 via pip for Python 3.6 (`pip3.6 install pygit2`)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Run `salt-master -V` and observe that pygit2 is unavailable
- Observe that python36-pygit2 is not available from EPEL or salt-py3-repo
- `head -1 "$(which salt-master)"` shows the restrictive interpreter that does not allow the version of pygit2 installed by pip to function for this particular version of Salt
