    /tmp/test.txt:
        Passed invalid arguments to cp.recv: recv() takes exactly 2 arguments (5 given)
        
            Used with salt-cp, pass the files dict, and the destination.
        
            This function receives small fast copy files from the master via salt-cp.
            It does not work via the CLI.
