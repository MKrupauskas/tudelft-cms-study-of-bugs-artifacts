The problem is the number of elements returned in comps (line 79 in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/parted.py). For some reason, perhaps on another platform, this check is looking for 8 elements before doing anything else. Without knowing the original author's intention I couldn't say why however there doesn't appear to be disk_flags coming from parted on Ubuntu Precise so there are only 7 elements and you get no info or partition information back.
