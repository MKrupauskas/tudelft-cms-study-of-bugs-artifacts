**Description**
Salt slack engine stopped working today February 24th 2021. Based on my research I think is due to this:  https://api.slack.com/changelog/2020-01-deprecating-antecedents-to-the-conversations-api 

"The final date for existing apps and custom integrations is now February 24th, 2021."

**Setup**

Slack engine that worked perfectly fine till today, no config changes. Debug log starting today. I've added a Diagnostic line in slack.py to check the data returned from slack api see lines between ========== lines in the debug output

```

```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Try to use the slack engine, I used to have forced slack client=1.0.0 due to other issues but no slack client version is working now.

**Expected behavior**
Slack engine should work.

**Additional context**
I guess the only fix would be to migrate to slack SDK:  https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/v3-migration/ . Am I missing any workaround? 
Looks like Slack published these deprecations more than one year ago, curious if there is a process to stay ahead of these moving forward.
