### Description of Issue
In a virtual environment, the virtual grain is attempted to be resolved to some value. Then in Windows it gets hardcoded to `physical` before attempting to resolve it again.

This is causing VMs to have their virtual grain set to `physical` if it doesn't match one of the options in this function.

### Setup
Run a Windows 2016 VM in any virtualization other than one listed in the function.

This happens in 2019.2.2.
