I'm getting this error when running a particular state:

```
    State: - pkgrepo
    Name:      epel
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   Failed to configure repo 'epel': dictionary changed size during iteration
        Changes:
```

The SLS is:

```
epel-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 6
    - name: epel
    - mirrorlist:
    - baseurl: 'http://mirrors.example.com/epel/6/$basearch'
    - gpgcheck: 1
    - gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6
    - enabled: 1
    - order: 1
    - require:
      - file: /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6
```

If I remove 'mirrorlist: ""' the error goes away, but then the rule doesn't update/remove the mirror list... (Well, it doesn't now either because of the error, but I believe this did work on 0.16.4, the error is on 0.17.2). I tried making the mirorlist value be "", it makes no difference.

Once upon a time there was a ticket #1876 that was maybe related, though not in a way that's obvious to me.
