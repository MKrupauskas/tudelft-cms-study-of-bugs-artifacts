### Description of Issue/Question

When running highstate on a minion using the tcp transport I see the following error a few times in my log:
`2016-05-04 18:22:53,955 [tornado.application][ERROR   ][11620] Future exception was never retrieved: StreamClosedError: Stream is closed`

Here is more context of that error:

```
[INFO    ] Got list of available master addresses: ['localhost']
[ERROR   ] Future exception was never retrieved: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/gen.py", line 230, in wrapper
    yielded = next(result)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 476, in eval_master
    pub_channel = salt.transport.client.AsyncPubChannel.factory(opts, **factory_kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/transport/client.py", line 163, in factory
    return salt.transport.tcp.AsyncTCPPubChannel(opts, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/transport/tcp.py", line 201, in __init__
    self.io_loop = kwargs['io_loop'] or tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
KeyError: 'io_loop'
Exception AttributeError: "'AsyncTCPPubChannel' object has no attribute '_closing'" in <bound method AsyncTCPPubChannel.__del__ of <salt.transport.tcp.AsyncTCPPubChannel object at 0x7fe0d9f4f850>> ignored
[INFO    ] Determining pillar cache
[ERROR   ] Future exception was never retrieved: StreamClosedError
[INFO    ] Determining pillar cache
[ERROR   ] Future exception was never retrieved: StreamClosedError
```

Everything seems to run ok but I"m not sure if this will cause issues down the road.
### Setup

Fresh install from repo.saltstack.com running on ubuntu 14.04.

Master config:

```
hash_type: sha256
keep_jobs: 1
open_mode: True
timeout: 30
transport: tcp

file_roots:
  base:
    - /etc/salt/git/salt
    - /etc/salt/git/salt/states

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /etc/salt/git/salt/pillar
```

Minion config:

```
hash_type: sha256
random_reauth_delay: 10
master:
  - smaster1-dusc.xxxxx.com
  - smaster2-dusc.xxxxx.com
master_type: failover
master_shuffle: True
master_alive_interval: 60
auth_timeout: 10
auth_tries: 0
retry_dns: 0
transport: tcp
startup_states: highstate
grains:
  ulsite: downlynk
  ulprovider: aws
  ultype: smaster
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Configure the master and minion to both use the tcp transport and run a highstate from the minion.
