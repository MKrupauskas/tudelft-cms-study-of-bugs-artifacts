Normal behaviour on an ldap-less master:
1. Define a user in the client_acl section.
2. (Re)Start master service
3. Master creates a user key for the user in /var/cache/salt/master/.username_key

However, when the system is configured to use LDAP for OS level users, step 3 fails, which means the user can not execute to configured module/commands.

Note: calling os.getlogin() in a python interpreter shell  does return the username of the user, so it isn't a matter of Python not being able to determine this information, also getent passwd USER and id USER from the CLI also work. This is on a fresh install of 0.16.0 on a fresh install of Debian/Wheezy

I am aware of the auth via ldap route, but I'd like to keep it simple and re-use the existing system level user setup (that being one big reason to use system level usernames).. 

I've not yet tracked down where in the code this is not working, but I am looking.
