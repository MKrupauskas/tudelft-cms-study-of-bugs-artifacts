I have a Windows 2008 R2 machine and keep getting this error:
admatriusy02c:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'c:\users\exh345\appdata\local\temp\2\tmp3kxie9'

So I assume some of the permissions have changed, since previously on client version 0.17.2, this error wasn't present.

These people seem to have the same issue:
