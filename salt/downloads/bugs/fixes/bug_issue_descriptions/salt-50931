### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
My machine is a Virtual Machine with 16GB of memory, before calling jobs.list_jobs I have 15GB free.
I have 42 nodes connected on the Salt master.
I also use the returner pgjsonb (event_return and master_job_cache)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I query jobs list from yesterday and only one node match
```
salt-run jobs.list_jobs start_time='2018-12-20' search_target='tlsslt-p01-mst*'
```

It seems like all the data are get and python is filtering.
