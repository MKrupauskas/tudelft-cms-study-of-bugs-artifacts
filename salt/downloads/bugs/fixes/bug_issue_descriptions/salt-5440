When using git as a backend and the environment is not explicitly specified, salt may select an environment/branch other than the base/master. I've specifically seen this with state.show_top and state.highstate.

Here's the (truncated) top file for the main branch:

```
root@SALT:/srv/salt# cat top.sls 
base:
  '*':
    - salt
    - users
    - log
    - ssh
    - snmp
```

One of the servers (it's affecting all servers)

```
root@SERVER1:~# salt-call state.show_top
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file 'salt://top.sls'

base:
    ----------
    *:
        - salt
        - users
        - log

```

It's missing the last two states, ssh and snmp. It seems to be picking up the top.sls file from an env/branch other than the base/master. It matched two branches, so I removed both of them from git and tested it again. It picked a different branch this time, still not the master. It's not picking the newest branch or the earliest in the alphabet, I'm unsure how it decides what to use.

Here are select parts of the salt master conf file:

```
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt
fileserver_backend:
  #- roots
  - git
gitfs_remotes:
  - git://[servername]/salt
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/pillar
```

Running state.sls with env=branchname works just fine and uses the environment specified.

I'm using Salt 0.15.1, but I'm reasonably sure I've seen similar behavior in earlier versions. The master is on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with git 1.7.9.5 and python-git 0.1.6.
