### Description of Issue/Question

When trying to create new medium or large server with salt-cloud into Scaleway. Server creation fails because medium and large instances require additional volumes.  
### Setup

Contents of /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/vc1m-ubuntu-1604.conf:

```
vc1m-ubuntu-1604:
  provider: scaleway
  image: 047f1372-3923-471f-82ca-5ff69dbaf0f7
  commercial_type: VC1M
  script_args: -l
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Command:

```
salt-cloud -p vc1m-ubuntu-1604 newserver
```

Output:

```
[ERROR   ] Error creating newserver on Scaleway

The following exception was thrown when trying to run the initial deployment: An error occurred while querying Scaleway. HTTP Code: 400  Error: '{"message": "The sum of volumes sizes of VC1M instances must be between 51GB and 100GB", "type": "invalid_request_error"}'
Error: There was a profile error: Failed to deploy VM
```

So appropriate fix would be an option to add additional volumes on profile config.
