### Description of Issue/Question
Given a dynamic state `file.line` does not insert a new line as expected. Given the state provided in the setup section it is expected to get behavior that continually inserts a new line above the line `AAAAAAA`. Instead, the first attempt adds a new line, however subsequent executions of the state do not modify the file at all.

I tried using the `ensure` mode to see if that would be a valid workaround for this issue. This worked, but replaced the line with the new content instead of inserting the new line as expected.

Further testing revealed that if the beginning of the string changes, then the line gets inserted. But changing on the end of the line will not update the line. 

### Setup
Setup a 2018.3.2 master and minion.

Create a file called `/var/log/salt/test.log` with write permissions for the root user:

```
AAAAAAA
```

Add this state:

```
{% set curtime = None | strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') %} 
update_missing_list: 
  file.line: 
    - name: /var/log/salt/test.log 
    - mode: insert
    - content: {{ curtime }}
    - before: AAAAAAA
```
