### Description of Issue/Question

Every few days (4 or 5 days) salt-master stops responding and we need to restart salt-master.
### Setup

We have a number of salt-syndics that connect to this salt-master. Syndics are very old version (2014.7.5). We get a fair number of "Salt minion claiming to be <redacted> has attempted tocommunicate with the master and could not be verified" messages in the logs but functionally everything works until salt-master crashes.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

StreamClosedError
```

and the StreamClosedError exception keeps repeating about 15 times (within 2 or 3 seconds) and then the log stops completely.
