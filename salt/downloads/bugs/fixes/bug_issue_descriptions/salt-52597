For this test, we are using an external pillar to hold our server roles and a (release) phase 

```yaml
# from /etc/salt/master.d/base.conf
# ext_pillar_first is required so that we can read our role and phase values
# from our csv file and then later read that in /srv/pillar/top
ext_pillar_first: true
ext_pillar:
  - csv: /srv/salt/defaults/alpha.csv
  - csv: /srv/salt/defaults/beta.csv
  - csv: /srv/salt/defaults/release.csv
```

An example of one of our pillars shows the list of salt IDs with a phase and a role

```csv
id,phase,role
example1,alpha,database
example2,alpha,web
example3,alpha,other
```

In our regular pillar top, we have some default, global pillars (mostly our scheduled jobs) and then a pillar for each phase we want to support (to hold database settings and passwords different across different (release) phases

```yaml
# /srv/pillar/top.sls
# This requires ext_pillar_first: true so that our environment pillars are
# read in first. Without that, we cannot match these pillars on our
# environment pillars. Please see /etc/salt/master.d/base.conf
base:
  '*':
    - defaults
  'phase:alpha':
    - match: pillar
    - phase.alpha
  'phase:beta':
    - match: pillar
    - phase.beta
  'phase:release':
    - match: pillar
    - phase.release
```

Under 2018.x this worked fine, but noticing issues like #52567 and #51360 it seems like this broke somewhere in between there.

Looking through our stacktrace, we see that when we call compile_pillar, we load our `ext_pillar` and it works fine up until this point

```python
if self.opts.get('ext_pillar_first', False):
   self.opts['pillar'], errors = self.ext_pillar(self.pillar_override)
```

we would get something similar to `{"id": "example1", "phase": "alpha", "role": "database"}`

we then go into our `top_matches` which pulls up `salt/matchers/confirm_top.py` which seeing our `- match: pillar` in our `/srv/pillar/top.sls` also calls `salt/matchers/pillar_match.py` which throws an exception trying to read our pillars from `__opts__['pillar']`
Though we successfully loaded our ext_pillar `self.opts['pillar'], errors = self.ext_pillar(self.pillar_override)` this value never makes it to `confirm_top` or `pillar.match` because our ext_pillar is never loaded into the `__opts__` dunder dictionary

Our external pillar is never loaded into ` __opts__['pillar']` so we crash here

```python
    return salt.utils.data.subdict_match(
        __opts__['pillar'], tgt, delimiter=delimiter
    )
```

I'm still trying to figure out the exact commits that have affected this change, but hopefully this is enough to help someone else to also confirm
