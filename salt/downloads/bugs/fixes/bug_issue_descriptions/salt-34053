### Description of Issue/Question

Targeting pre defined grains, such as os and os_family results in:

```
vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G 'os:Ubuntu' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.

ERROR: No return received
```
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Using vagrant 1.8.1 and Virtualbox 5.0.20 r106931
Vagrant boxes used: ubuntu/trusty64 and centos/7 (same behavior here, as with the ubuntu box)
Vagrantfile: https://github.com/Modulus/SaltJenkinsNginx/blob/master/Vagrantfile
Master/Minion config and certs: https://github.com/Modulus/SaltJenkinsNginx/tree/master/etc
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

These calls results in errors:

```
vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G "os:Ubuntu" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received

vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G "os_family:Debian" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received

vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G "os:CentOS" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```

These calls work fine:

```
vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt "*" grains.item os
minion1:
    ----------
    os:
        Ubuntu
minion2:
    ----------
    os:
        CentOS

vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt "*" grains.item os_family
minion2:
    ----------
    os_family:
        RedHat
minion1:
    ----------
    os_family:
        Debian

vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G "roles:build" test.ping
minion1:
    True

vagrant@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt -G "roles:repository" test.ping
minion2:
    True
```
