range (-R) option doesn't throw an error if python seco.range library is missing. 

Could you please make sure a some meaningful error is thrown if the lib is missing?

The only error found in the server.log was

2013-12-11_01:40:00.26333 [ERROR   ] Failed matching available minions with range pattern: %range-foo-bar
