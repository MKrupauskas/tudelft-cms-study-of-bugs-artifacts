We have test scenario under 0.17.4 comprising a top-level master "arrowtooth"(which is a minion to itself so we can update it's packages), two syndic masters "ling" and "arden" (which are minions to themselves as recommended in issue #6207) and two true minions "cobia" and "dern", one connected to each syndic.

If you do "salt '_' test.ping" from the top-level master all five hosts respond but if you try and call one of the true minions using a glob like 'c_' which should match they do not respond. If you do the second test from the minion's syndic master, it responds as expected.

For example, when run on the top-level master (arrowtooth) you get all five hosts responding:
[arrowtooth ~] $ salt '*' test.ping
arrowtooth:
    True
ling:
    True
cobia:
    True
dern:
    True
arden:
    True

And if you target hosts that are top-level or a syndic they respond too:
[arrowtooth ~] $ salt 'a*' test.ping
arrowtooth:
    True
arden:
    True

But a true minion "cobia" under a syndic "ling" does not:
[arrowtooth ~] $ salt 'c*' test.ping
[arrowtooth ~] $

However running that command on the minion's syndic master gets a response:
[ling ~]$ salt 'c*' test.ping
cobia:
    True
[ling] $ 

In addition, we have assigned a "role" grain to all the minions in /etc/salt/grains. A true minion will always respond to a grain matched command run on it's own syndic master but will only sometimes, or may never respond, to the same command run from the top-level master.

For example, the roles assigned are:
[arrowtooth ~]$ salt '*' grains.item role
arrowtooth:
  role:
      Editor
ling:
    ----------
    role:
        - Editor
        - Scooper
cobia:
    ----------
    role:
        - Editor
        - Scooper
        - WebServer
dern:
    ----------
    role:
        - Editor
        - WebServer
arden:
    ----------
    role:
        - Editor

For some reason all hosts will respond if looking for the Editor role:
[arrowtooth ~]$ salt -G 'role:Editor' test.ping
arrowtooth:
    True
ling:
    True
cobia:
    True
dern:
    True
arden:
    True

But none respond for WebServer:
[arrowtooth ~]$ salt -G 'role:WebServer' test.ping
[arrowtooth ~]$

Again though, the true minions will respond is called from their syndic master:
[ling ~]$ salt -G 'role:WebServer' test.ping
cobia:
    True

[arden ~]$ salt -G 'role:WebServer' test.ping
dern:
    True

I am happy to accept this might be a config issue but I can't see anything obviously wrong.
