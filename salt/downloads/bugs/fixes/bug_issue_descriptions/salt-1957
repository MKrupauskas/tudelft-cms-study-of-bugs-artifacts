On my debian wheezy system, init scripts migth fail like this:

``` sh
root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master restart
Stopping salt-master daemon: OK
Starting salt-master daemon: already started, lock file found
```

but the service is down now. you can check it by:

``` sh
root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master stop
Stopping salt-master daemon: Daemon is not started
```

trying once more:

``` sh
root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master start
Starting salt-master daemon: OK

root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master restart
Stopping salt-master daemon: OK
Starting salt-master daemon: already started, lock file found

root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master start
Starting salt-master daemon: OK

root@vps-server:/srv/salt# /etc/init.d/salt-master restart
Stopping salt-master daemon: OK
Starting salt-master daemon: already started, lock file found
```

Stil fails.
This looks like `/etc/init.d/salt-master stop`  should check if the process is really down,  instead of only sending the kill signal.
