I've built upon the work of Tor Hveem and Dan Garthwaite, and constructed a check_mk integration for Icinga / Salt.

I'm seeing constant timeouts on publish.publish on 0.15.3 and am unsure how to troubleshoot them further. I'm prepared to devote significant time to resolving this, but need a pointer in the right direction, please.
