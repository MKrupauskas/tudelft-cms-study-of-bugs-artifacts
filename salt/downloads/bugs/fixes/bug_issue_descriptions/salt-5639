I had previously submitted PR https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/4533 to make the HOSTS file entries one per line, but it looks like maybe it broke some tests and got purged? Not sure. The current setup has a couple problems with us:

1) It isn't readable or easy to work with when you have lots of host entries for the same host (I have 50 hosts going to 127.0.0.1 in dev vm environments)

2) We've seen bugs in some systems, specifically OS X, where too many entries for a line can lead to weird networking issues.

Is there any reason not to do one entry per line?
