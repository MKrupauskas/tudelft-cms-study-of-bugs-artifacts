When a new nodegroup is added, the documentation states the salt master must be restarted before it's usable.

This however is not true from the commandline, as running "salt -N foo ..." properly accesses the new nodegroup definition without a master restart.

This has lead to difficult-to-debug problems where testing directly in the CLI works, but referencing the nodegroup in a topfile doesn't.
