Issue:-

I am trying to develop to a solution to my deployment problem using Salt-client python API. When ever I make call to highstate without Timeout, it just return back with no response immediately. It is happening in CLI too.

I tried to resolve this issue through googlegroup

but according to Ollie

It's likely that the jobs ran correctly but the windows minions can only run one job at a time (issue #5395). The salt client runs a second job after the timeout to check that the original job is still running. If this doesn't return the client assumes the minions are dead and returns.

Running with a very high timeout (longer the highstate would take to run) should workaround the issue for now.

So I gave timeout with higher value, but it is not a solution to my problem, I have to wait for no means as I do not know how much time states would take.

I am using Salt_master on Cent-OS 6.4 and Minions are installed on Windows 7 Enterprise edition.

Salt version used on both the system : 0.16.3

States:

```
top.sls
-------------------------------------------------------
{% set minion = pillar.get('minion','pranagga') %}
{% if minion != None %}
base:
  '{{ minion }}':
    - TestM

    - TestM.copyConf
    - TestM.copyLibs
    - TestM.synctestsuite
    - TestM.webtests
    - TestM.tomcatStart
    - TestM.tdmWarDeploy
{% endif %}
```

```
TestM.copyConf.sls
-------------------------------------------------------
sync-conf:
  file:
    - name: {{ pillar['tdmhome'] }}
    - recurse
    - source:  salt://{{  pillar['distroot'] }}conf
    - makedirs: True
    - exclude_pat: TdmConfig.groovy
```

```
TestM.tdmWarDeploy.sls
-------------------------------------------------------------
tdm-war:
 tomcat.war_deployed:
  - name: /tdm
#  - war: {{ pillar['badahome'] }}tdm.war
  - war: salt://{{ pillar['distroot'] }}tdm.war
  - require:
    - file: set-config
    - service: tomcat-start
    - file: sync-conf
    - cmd: app-db
```

etc.

In calsls.py

```
ret = client.cmd('*','state.highstate',[pillars],timeout=6000)
```

if I do not give timeout it return back with no response.
