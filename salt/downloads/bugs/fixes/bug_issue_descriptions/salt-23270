Hi! Thank you for the great work on this cloud provider.

I am running esxi5.5 standard, but I am getting an issue after creating my VM, both with static, or a dhcp IP:

template: basic ubuntu 14.04 LTS install converted into template
vmtools: tried with vmware-tools as well as the recommended open-vm-tools
- the VM is created and I can add or modify the template's existing NICs (tried with template with one nic or none).
- when the vm is cloned, looking in settings I see that 'connected' and 'connect at poweron' are not checked. 
- salt-cloud gets stuck on 'Waiting to get IP information , which it never gets unless I manually connect the NIC in the vsphere client and do an ifup on the command line from the console, but this still doesn't help with the /etc/network/interfaces configuration , which never makes it into the template.
- I have to ctrl+c out of it in the end.

I noticed that:

```
               connectable = (vim.vm.device.VirtualDevice.ConnectInfo) {
                  dynamicType = <unset>,
                  dynamicProperty = (vmodl.DynamicProperty) [],
                  startConnected = true,
                  allowGuestControl = true,
                  connected = false,
                  status = <unset>
```

has _connected = false_ , this I could change in the vmware.py file but even setting it to true and having the output show it did not actually check the connected box on the VM cloned from the template.

My cloud.profiles config:

```
vmware-ubuntu-14.04-public:
  provider: my-vsphere
  clonefrom: ubuntu2

  cluster: cluster1.

  datastore: Datastore1

  datacenter: Home

  power_on: True

  devices:
    network:
      Network adapter 1:

        subnet_mask: 255.255.255.240
        domain: cloud.com
        type: vmxnet3

  dns_servers:

    - 8.8.4.4
  domain: cloud.com

  deploy: True
  ssh_username: ubuntu

```

Please let me know what else you'd need to troubleshoot this. Thanks!
