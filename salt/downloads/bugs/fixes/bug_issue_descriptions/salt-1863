I believe I have identified a memory leak in salt-master. It appears that when a minion tries to check in but their key has not been accepted that the salt-master process leaks memory. We pushed out salt to a bunch of CentOS 6 clients via cfengine and had not accepted the keys yet. The salt-master processes grew to be huge. Running an strace showed the clients being rejected from connecting.

I restarted salt-master yesterday and the processes today showed: 5 of the master processes around 14mb each (near where it was after startup), 3 are around 200mb each, and 2 are at 211mb each. They memory usage grew each time a non-accepted client checked in. As soon as I accepted the keys, salt-master stopped growing in size.

Thanks,
Scooby
