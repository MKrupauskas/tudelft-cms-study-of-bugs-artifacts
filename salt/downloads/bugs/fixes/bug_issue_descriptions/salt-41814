### Description of Issue

Engines running in the minion context (setup in the minion config) cannot execute `__salt__` commands which require communication with the Salt Master.

The issue is when modules attempt to use certain keys in `__opts__`, such as `master_uri`. These keys are populated by the `eval_master` method in `minion.py`, but `eval_master` is only called *after* the engines have already been started, thus engines see an incomplete `__opts__` dictionary.

I would make a PR to fix it, but I'm not familiar enough with the minion startup to be confident that I won't break it all .

### Setup
Only need one master and one minion to reproduce the issue

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Simple engine:

```python
# _engines/fail_example.py
def start():
    __salt__['cp.get_file_str']('salt://foo.txt')
```

An engines config:
```yaml
# minion.d/failing-engine.conf
engines:
    - fail_example: {}
```

Upon startup, the engine will fail when the `crypt.py` module attempts to access `__opts__['master_uri']` during `cp.get_file_str`.
