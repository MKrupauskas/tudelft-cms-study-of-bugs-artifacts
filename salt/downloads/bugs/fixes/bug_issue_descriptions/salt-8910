Reading http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/file_server/dynamic-modules.html, I get the impression that I should be able to make a new execution module (that is to be called from Jinja templates in my states) available simply by checking it in to `_modules/` under my gitfs root. However, the module isn't found until I do an explicit `sudo salt '*' saltutil.sync_modules`. I haven't touched any configuration settings for autoload, and according to docs it should be on by default. I also tried restarting the minion services (although I'd rather not have to), but it didn't help. Salt 0.17.2-2.
