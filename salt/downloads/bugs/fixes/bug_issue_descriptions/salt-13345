I have the following block in one of my .sls files:

```
docker-bridge:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: bridge
    - ipaddr: 172.18.42.1
    - netmask: 255.255.255.0
    - onboot: yes
    - proto: none
    - delay: 0
```

However, running that state file with state.sls results in no change reported, like so:

```
...
local:
----------
          ID: docker-bridge
    Function: network.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: Interface docker-bridge is up to date.
     Changes:   

Summary

```

And no bridge is actually setup.

However, if I have the following:

```
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-docker-bridge:
  file.managed:
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 0644
    - contents: |

        IPADDR=172.18.42.1
        NETMASK=255.255.255.0
        ONBOOT=yes
        BOOTPROTO=none
        DELAY=0

ifdown docker-bridge && ifup docker-bridge:
  cmd.wait:
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-docker-bridge

# The following doesn't seem to work with Amazon Linux.
docker-bridge:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: bridge
    - ipaddr: 172.18.42.1
    - netmask: 255.255.255.0
    - onboot: yes
    - proto: none
    - delay: 0
    - watch:
      - file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-docker-bridge
```

I will see the following if I run the state:

```

And the diff about removing lines from the config file will happen every single time I run the state file. It's like the there's no template for the network interface config file. I thought that perhaps that was because the salt/templates/rh_ip/rh6_eth.jinja template was not being applied on Amazon Linux. However, I could not figure out how the code ever decides to use that template. If anyone has any insight, that'd be super helpful.

FWIW, I am using the latest EPEL6 package, which is version 2014.1.4.
