Salt's locale state will started everytime, if choosen locale has not been generated via `locale-gen` before

This happens on a ubuntu version, which has been installed via xen debootstrap.
I've tried to set de_DE.UTF-8 as default locale.

This fails, because `locale -a` won't list the locale by default
It has to be set via `locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8`. 

Without this step, salt state locale.present will be fired up every time, but without an error message

```
          ID: de_locale
    Function: locale.present
        Name: de_DE.UTF-8
      Result: True
     Comment: Generated locale de_DE.UTF-8

              locale:

```

a manual `update-locales` without `locale-gen de_DE.UTF-8` produced this error message, which won't be catched by the salt state

```

It seems, that the fix for #23767 (my other locale based issue) won't fix this too.
