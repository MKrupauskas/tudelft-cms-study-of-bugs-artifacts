Running latest 2016.3.1 on master and minion, Ubuntu 14.04.

```
test:
  ssh_auth.present:
    - user: test
    - source: s3://bucket/folder/key.pub
```

This fails with an error about being unable to get the file from s3. `s3.key` and `s3.keyid` are set, and other states are able to fetch files from the same bucket and folder. As a sanity check, I swapped this for:

```
/home/test/.ssh/authorized_keys:
  file.managed:
    - source: s3://bucket/folder/key.pub
    - source_hash: sha256=thehash
    - user: test
    - group: test
```

This worked. So, the issue is in ssh_auth's interaction with s3 sources.
