Given the roster file `/etc/default/roster` using two containers:

```
first:
  host: 170ae876cb86

second:
  host: 6e821c5c755d
```

If roster_defaults is not set, the output is as expected:

```
# salt-ssh '*' cmd.run hostname
first:
    170ae876cb86
second:
    6e821c5c755d
```

But when set:

```
# cat /etc/salt/master| grep roster_defaults
roster_defaults: {}
```

The command is always executed on the same server:

```
# salt-ssh '*' cmd.run hostname
first:
    170ae876cb86
second:
    170ae876cb86
```

Quick&Ugly fix: in [salt/roster/flat.py:RosterMatcher.ret_glob_minions](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/roster/flat.py#L81), replace `minions[minion] = data` with `minions[minion] = dict(data.items())` to work on a copy of `data`.

Various notes:

- from the source code, I think the problem also occurs with other matchers (`ret_pcre_minions()`, `ret_list_minions()`, `ret_nodegroup_minions`, ...).
- I reproduce the problem with salt-ssh 2017.7.2 (Nitrogen) (the version shipped by salt repository), but not with salt-ssh 2015.8.8 (Beryllium) (verison shipped with Ubuntu/xenial).
