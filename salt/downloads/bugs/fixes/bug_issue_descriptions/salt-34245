### Description of Issue/Question

ini.options_present reports `Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)` on every highstate, even if file really didn't change. It does add whitespace at the beginning of file on first run though, but it shows that last ini key has changed.
### Setup

Let's say there is already file `/etc/myapp.ini` with contents:

```
[general]
```

state declaration:

```
ini:
  ini.options_present:
    - name: /etc/myapp.ini
    - sections:
        general:
          server_hostname: my.company.com
          server_port: 12345
```

Now if highstate is run, it does add these state-declared ini keys successfully:

```
root@vdebian2:/# cat /etc/myapp.ini 
[general]
```

```
root@vdebian2:/# salt minion state.highstate
minion:
----------
          ID: ini
    Function: ini.options_present
        Name: /etc/myapp.ini
      Result: True

                      after:
                          my.company.com
                      before:
                          None
                  server_port:
                      ----------
                      after:
                          12345
                      before:
                          None

```

```
root@vdebian2:/# cat /etc/myapp.ini 

[general]
server_hostname = my.company.com
server_port = 12345
```

Though there is some extra whitespace at the beginning of file.

highstate again:

```
root@vdebian2:/# salt minion state.highstate
minion:
----------
          ID: ini
    Function: ini.options_present
        Name: /etc/myapp.ini
      Result: True

              general:
                  ----------
                  server_port:
                      ----------
                      after:
                          12345
                      before:
                          12345

Summary for minion
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
```

It thinks that last key `server_port` changed, though it was and is the same.
Contents again (the same):

```
root@vdebian2:/# cat /etc/myapp.ini 

[general]
server_hostname = my.company.com
server_port = 12345
```

Every highstate results in that `Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)`, though nothing actually changes.
