### Description of Issue/Question

`network.default_route` throws IndexError Exception when netstat binary is not installed

`salt-run network.default_route` results in an `IndexError` Exception when running on a system that doesn't have the `netstat` binary installed by default (e.g CentOS 7.x).  Some distributions are now deprecating `netstat` for other tools such as `ss`. 

It may make sense to use something more portable such as `/proc/net/route` or intelligently determine available CLI's to shell out to in  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/network.py#L343.


### Setup

1. Install latest CentOS 7.X
2. Install latest Salt


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```bash
[root@salt-minion-v7 vagrant]# salt-call network.default_route
