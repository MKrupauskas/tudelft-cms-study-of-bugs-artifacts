I have the following external authentication system config in the master:

```
external_auth:
  pam:
    saltusers%:
      - '*'
        - 'test.*'
        - 'grains.get'
        - 'grains.items'
        - 'grains.item'
        - 'grains.has_value'
        - 'grains.ls'
```

According to the example at - http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/eauth/index.html - this is valid.

However, on restarting the master, there are errors:

```
# /etc/init.d/salt-master restart
[....] Restarting salt master control daemon: salt-master[ERROR   ] Error parsing configuration file: /etc/salt/master - while parsing a block collection

  in "<string>", line 189, column 9:
            - 'test.*'
            ^
. ok 

```
