If an EC2 instance named foobar was terminated, in some cases it is possible to use salt-cloud to re-create an instance named foobar many times.

Where it checks for a machine already existing, it appears to me that the code expects machine names to be unique, so it only checks the one instance it hits first to see if it is terminated.

If that first one it finds is terminated, it allows creating the instance, over and over and over.

This issue oddly seemed more reproducible when making the salt-cloud call using subprocess within a python shell rather than a bash shell.
