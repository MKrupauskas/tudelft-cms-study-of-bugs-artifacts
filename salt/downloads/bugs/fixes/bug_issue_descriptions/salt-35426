### Description of Issue/Question

We have a pretty complicated series of includes to implement a set of inter-related formulae. All but one of these includes specifies aggregate: False in the pkg.installed states. The one which includes an aggregate: True causes all the other aggregate: False entries to be ignored.

I think this is the wrong order of operations. An explicit aggregate: False should _always_ be respected.
