I'd like to have a `cmd.wait` state `watch` a `cmd.run` state.  For example:

```
do_foo:
  cmd.run:
    - unless: test "0" == "0"

post_foo:
  cmd.wait:
    - watch:
      - cmd: do_foo
```

It appears that `cmd.run` states always return as if they execute despite `onlyif` / `unless` clauses preventing them from doing so.  In the example above, `post_foo` always executes.

Is the above misconfigured and is there a way to achieve what I'm trying to do?

Thanks!
