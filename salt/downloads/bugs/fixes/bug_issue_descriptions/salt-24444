When trying to apply the following state:

``` yaml
/dead_symlink:
  file.managed:
    - follow_symlinks: false
    - source: /some_file
```

where `/dead_symlink` is a symbolic link, pointing to a non-existing target, the state fails with the following error:

```
Unable to manage file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''/dead_symlink''
```

Looks like `follow_symlinks: false` does not handle dead symlinks correctly.
When the target file exists, everything works as expected.
