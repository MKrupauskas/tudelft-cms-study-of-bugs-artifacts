With the gitfs rewrite for 2015.8.0, I added a check to ensure the target env is in the list of environments. This had the unfortunate side effect of denying the ability to request a commit SHA as the fileserver environment.

Examples:
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5cbaaed/salt/utils/gitfs.py#L2540
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5cbaaed/salt/utils/gitfs.py#L2720
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/5cbaaed/salt/utils/gitfs.py#L2766
