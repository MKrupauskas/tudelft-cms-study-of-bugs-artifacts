As I mentioned in this mailing list post, ["Typo in top.sls causes blank output for minion with no indication as to what the error is"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/1XPnYNHDA14), 

Given a top.sls file containing "blah:\n", the salt command reports:

```
$ salt '*' states.highstate
<minion id>:

$
```

In other words, the output is blank. The exit state of salt is 0, indicating success (bug #7876).

There is no obvious cue as to where the problem is, or that there was a problem. (As a new user to salt, I might be wondering "Is it normal for the minon output to be blank"?). Instead salt should at least report that there was a problem with the yaml file, if not telling the user exactly what it is.
