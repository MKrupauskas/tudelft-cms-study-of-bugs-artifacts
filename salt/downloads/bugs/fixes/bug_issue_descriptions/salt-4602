Strange issue I noticed with runner functions call via salt-run(on master)  vs salt-call publish.runner(via minion). publish.runner seems to stop working  if runner function prints more than 1024 chars to stdout.
## myrunner.py

```
def printstr(num=10):
    ''' Print number of characters to stdout  and also return dict '''
    str='A'*int(num)
    ret_dict={}
    ret_dict['str']=str

    print str
    return ret_dict
```

On master. Only displays content printed by print statement and works well

```
 salt-run  myrunner.printstr 1024       ==> works (for num <=1024)
 salt-run myrunner-printstr 1025       ==> works (for  num>1024 as well)
```

On minion: Only prints a dictionary returned by the runner function and breaks as below

```
salt-call publish.runner  myrunner.printstr  1024   ==> works (for num <=1024)

salt-call publish.runner  myrunner.printstr  1025   ==> doesn't works (for num >1024)
```

This is a strange issue as the same call may or may not work via publish.runner. Even if it doesn't print out stdout, but somehow it cares about more than 1024 chars and returns nothing.
