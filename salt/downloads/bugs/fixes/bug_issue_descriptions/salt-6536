Hi,

Overtime (few minutes/couple of hours) minion status becomes down when you execute salt-run manage.status from master. However, only servers running CentOS 6.3 are affected.

We are running a mix of CentOS 6.3 and RHEL 6.4 and the minions running RHEL 6.4 have no such issue encountered.

salt-master is running on a CentOS 6.3.
Salt version is 0.16.0 (same issue is encountered using 0.14.1 and even on 0.10.3)

*I also have a set of servers, all running RHEL 6.4 and salt 0.14.1, and I do not encounter this issue (only happens on mix of CentOS and RHEL).
