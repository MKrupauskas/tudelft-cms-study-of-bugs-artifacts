Example:

grant_example:
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: SELECT, ALTER, LOCK TABLES
    - database: example_db.*
    - user: example_user
    - host: localhost  

The above works because SELECT, ALTER, LOCK TABLES are in the same order as SHOW GRANTS FOR USER 'example_user'@'localhost';  would return

grant_example:
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: ALTER, LOCK TABLES, SELECT
    - database: example_db.*
    - user: example_user
    - host: localhost  

The above will cause the fallowing query to be executed 

GRANT ALTER, LOCK TABLES, SELECT to 'example_user'@'localhost'; 

However when the code checks the the return of the SHOW GRANTS FOR 'example_user'@'localhost' against the string passed to 'grant' in mysql_grants.present it reports a failure even though the correct permissions are in mysql.
