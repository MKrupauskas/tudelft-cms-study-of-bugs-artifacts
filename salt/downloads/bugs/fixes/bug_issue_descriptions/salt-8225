Looks like salt-ssh is ignoring 'cachedir' and 'file_roots' settings in the master config and uses default values when executing salt.sls or salt.highstate. It tries to create salt_state.tgz in /var/cache on local host and also looks for the state files in /srv/salt instead of specified base in file_roots
