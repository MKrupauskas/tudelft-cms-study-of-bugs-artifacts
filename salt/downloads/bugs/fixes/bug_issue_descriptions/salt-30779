H,

This is a general proxy minion question:

How do I access data cached in the connection module from the grains module?

In the proxy minion rest example I saw that the grains cache and the grains retrieval method are implemented in the proxy's connection module, which makes sense because one would need a connection to retrieve the grains from the third party in the first place. As far as I understand, the grain data is needed in a different module in the grains package to make the grains feature work. 

Because the modules are loaded dynamically, under a different namespace,  I can't access the cached data in the connection module directly. Furthermore, I am not able to access the pillar data either (**pillar** is blank). How do I retrieve the proxy module? What am I missing?

Thanks
Alex
