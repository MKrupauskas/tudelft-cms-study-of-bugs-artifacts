salt 2014.1.3

I believe this is similar to issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/1268. This might be a duplicate but i don't see anything that actually matches this behavior. So I am writing this bug just in case.

I have an overstate file like so:

```
all:
  match: '*'
  sls:
    - gen_server

node2:
  match: 'server2*'
  sls:
    - cluster
  require:
    - all

node3:
  match: 'server3*'
  sls:
    - cluster
  require:
    - node3
```

Please notice in the last component how the require declaration refers to itself.  This then led to the following traceback.

```
