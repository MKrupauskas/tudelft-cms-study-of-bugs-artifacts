**Description**
When adding a container using the `salt.states.lxd_container.present` state, if more than one device is passed, it sometimes
fails to create all of them and only some or the last in the list is created.
 
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Create a *new* container with `salt.states.lxd_container.present` and pass more than one device
2. Once done, examine the list of devices for that container (e.g. `lxc config device show <container name>`)

(I've tested it inside a (slow) vm, so you might need some retries on a fast machine)

Example:
```
mkdir /tmp/test-disk0; mkdir /tmp/test-disk1
salt-call lxd.container_create name=test source=bionic/amd64 devices='{test-disk0: {device_type: disk, source: /tmp/test-disk0, path: storage }, test-disk1: {device_type: disk, source: /tmp/test-disk1, path: storage1}}'
lxc config device show test
```
Result:
```
lxc config device show test
test-disk1:
  path: storage1
  source: /tmp/test-disk1
  type: disk
```

=> only the second device was added

**Expected behavior**
All devices should be added to the container.

**Additional context**
Afaics, the bug happens because we don't wait for the device changes to be saved and therefore a device may be lost
when the next one is added. This bug can be fixed by applying the following patch:
```

  type: disk
test-disk1:
  path: storage1
  source: /tmp/test-disk1
  type: disk
```
