The following errors occur on a minion after completing a job in Salt RAET

socket.error = [Errno 2] No such file or directory: sending from /var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard0.uxd to /var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard4fd4c41200f57cb785.uxd
Error sending to '/var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard4fd4c41200f57cb785.uxd' from '/var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard0.uxd: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
Reaped yard yard4fd4c41200f57cb785
 Manage alpha.

socket.error = [Errno 61] Connection refused:
sending from /var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard0.uxd to /var/run/salt/minion/alpha.yard20140603131001408091.uxd
socket.error = [Errno 61] Connection refused

This is a result of the Master sending a reply to the completion of the minion targeted
task but the associate yard on the minion that ran the task no longer exists. So the minion raises an error when the minion router tries to forward the message to the yard.

Solution 1: Reap the yard when the job is done so the minion router will be able to filter because the remote yard is no longer in .remotes

Solution2: In raet the master should not sent back an ack. This was only required by
ZeroMQ. So need to change master when using raet to not send ack after ret from job is received

Should implement both Solution 1 and Solution 2
