When I execute a command from the salt master to the salt minions I often encounter problems with minions timing out. Following text is an excerpt from my bash. I have modified the minion names for security reasons. Everything is executed in a sequential order.

This is the first execution I do after all the minions were upgraded to verify that they have the correct version.

``` bash
mekstrem ~# salt -v 'minion*' test.version

minion5:

salt.exceptions.SaltReqTimeoutError: Waited 60 seconds
```

Here I try to do a test.version again about 15-20 seconds after the timeout and it seems like the communication to all minions are gone.

``` bash
mekstrem ~# salt -v 'minion*' test.version
Executing job with jid 20131106090738963305
-------------------------------------------
minion4:
    Minion did not return
minion2:
    Minion did not return
minion1:
    Minion did not return
minion3:
    Minion did not return
minion5:
    Minion did not return
```

Yet again I wait some time and execute the same command and it finally works like it should.

``` bash
mekstrem ~# salt -v 'minion*' test.version
Executing job with jid 20131106090752034671

minion5:

```
