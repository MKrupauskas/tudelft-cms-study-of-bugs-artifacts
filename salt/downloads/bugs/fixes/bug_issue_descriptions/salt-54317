### Description of Issue

Running `salt-run thin.generate overwrite=1` on openSUSE e.g. in `/root` directory fails with `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/root'`.

In `thin.py` is a `os.chdir(start_dir)`, where `start_dir` is the the current directory. This is not possible for the user `salt` and that's why the error is happening.

### Setup

You can easily reproduce this with a Salt that is not running as root. Switching to a directory where the user salt is configured to use has no permissions should also work. Now run the command.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Set the user salt is using to `salt` for example.
2. `cd /root`
3. `salt-run thin.generate overwrite=1`
4. Command fails with PermissionError.
