After the upgrade from 0.16.latest to 0.17.5 it happens sometimes that the same state reports in the same run that a salt://-sourced file can not be found:

---

```
State: - file
Name:      /var/drbd/www/html/stats/.htaccess
Function:  managed
    Result:    False
    Comment:   Source file salt://afaqurk/htaccess not found
    Changes:   
```

In the same run, salt states for another Minion the following:

---

```
State: - file
Name:      /var/drbd/www/html/ilias4/stats/.htaccess
Function:  managed
    Result:    True
    Comment:   The file /var/drbd/www/html/ilias4/stats/.htaccess is in the correct state
    Changes:   
```

So the file does exists.

This does not happen in batch runs.
