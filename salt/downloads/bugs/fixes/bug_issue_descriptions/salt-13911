When trying to do state.highstate or state.sls, I am seeing the
following error littered throughout the -l debug output of salt-call

```
socket.error = [Errno 111] Connection refused: sending from /var/run/salt/minion/two.gluster.gtmanfred.com.yard20140702021754784589.uxd to /var/run/salt/minion/two.gluster.gtmanfred.com.yard0.uxd
Error sending to '/var/run/salt/minion/two.gluster.gtmanfred.com.yard0.uxd' from '/var/run/salt/minion/two.gluster.gtmanfred.com.yard20140702021754784589.uxd: [Errno 111] Connection refused
Reaped yard yard0
```

Everything seems to run correctly. But the error is not ideal.

Thanks
Daniel
