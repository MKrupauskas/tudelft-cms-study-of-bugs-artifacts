### Description of Issue/Question
When using docker_image.present to pull images from a private registry, if the image version is not available on the registry the state will return a success while logging an error in the comments : 
```          ID: docker-failed-pull
    Function: docker_image.present
      Result: True
     Comment: Image 'image_name:bad_version' was pulled

              ----------
              Errors:
                  - Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on local_dns_server: server misbehaving
              Time_Elapsed:
                  0.021245956420898438
              retcode:
                  1
```
(Note : the error about dns lookup is because this docker host is isolated and can only pull from our private registry)
