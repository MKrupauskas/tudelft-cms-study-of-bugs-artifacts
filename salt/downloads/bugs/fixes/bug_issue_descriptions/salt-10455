When a watched file is changed, service.running successfully detects that and stops the service, however, it has never successfully restarted the service. I've tried both "reload: True" and "fully_restart: True".  But, no matter what service I've tried this on, it's never worked - salt-call seems to hang.  I've waited many, many minutes after service is down and must finally use ctrl-c to stop salt-call process.  Here is one of my state files:

```
sshGroup:
  group:
   - present

ssh-pkg-install:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - names:
      - sshClient
      - sshClientPatch
      - sshServer
