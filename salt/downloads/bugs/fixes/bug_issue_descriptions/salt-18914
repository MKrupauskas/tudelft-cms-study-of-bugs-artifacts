Hi, I have a problem.

My Salt manages LDAP on minions, it installs tools like nscd, nslcd, configs like pam_ldap.conf, /etc/openldap/ldap.conf etc. for binding user database to remote LDAP server.

Salt puts all this configs and daemons during highstate and it works fine. But later, when Salt tries to create file owned by LDAP user, it fails until next run. The problem is located in file.user_to_uid and file.user_to_uid and file.group_to_gid functions. File module imports pwd module and I think pwd module loads users storages (like /etc/passwd) on init. At that moment there are no LDAP settings on minion. Later LDAP settings installs (for example, command 'id user' starts to resolve uids), but pwd module is not reloaded and it doesn't know any about LDAP. So in later states salt-minion cannot check presence of the user, because pwd module contains out-of-sync info. On next salt run pwd module can resolve LDAP user and the problem disappears.

I have some ideas how to fix this issue. For example, salt can call id util instad of using pwd module here. But I am not sure it is a good choice.
