After upgrading from 2014.1.1 to 2014.7.0, `salt -l debug test-host test.ping` resulted in

```

Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

I downgraded to 2014.1.1 again.
