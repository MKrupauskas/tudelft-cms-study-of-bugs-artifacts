### Description of Issue/Question

If I have defined a state that installes the `@angular/cli` it installs but outputs some error and reinstalls every time as it cannot detect it being installed. I am not sure if the issue is quoting or not, because values are not allowed to start with `@` so I have to quote it.

I get the following output:

```
[ERROR   ] ['/usr/bin/ng -> /usr/lib/node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng', '{', '  "dependencies": {', '    "@angular/cli": {', '      "version": "1.0.4",', '      "from": "@angular/cli@1.0.4",', '      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@angular/cli/-/cli-1.0.4.tgz"', '    }', '  }', '}']
local:
----------
          ID: angular_cli
    Function: npm.installed
        Name: @angular/cli@1.0.4
      Result: True
     Comment: Package(s) '@angular/cli@1.0.4' successfully installed
     Started: 22:38:35.386168
    Duration: 32300.493 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              new:
                  - @angular/cli@1.0.4
              old:
```

But next time it installs again and acts as if it was not installed.

### Setup

Install through, either of these, result is the same:

```sts
"@angular/cli":
  npm.installed: []
```

```sts
angular_cli:
  npm.installed:
    - name: "@angular/cli"
```

```sts
angular_cli:
  npm.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - "@angular/cli"
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Install through the previous instructions and observe the behaviour mentioned in the first section.
