I accidentally added both source and contents_pillar to a file.managed state and this was the behaviour I got. (The file I referenced to with source didn't even exist.)
- `state.highstate test=True` said it was in the correct state.
- `state.highstate` gave me the error `Unable to manage file: 'hash_type'`
- The minion-log stated: `[salt.state       ][ERROR   ] Unable to manage file: 'hash_type'`

The log should mention which state is being handled and the error could've been somewhat more clear ;)
(In another state I also seem to have forgotten the source and that gives me the error `[salt.loaded.int.states.file][WARNING ] Neither 'source' nor 'contents' nor 'contents_pillar' nor 'contents_grains' was defined, yet 'replace' was set to 'True'. As there is no source to replace the file with, 'replace' has been set to 'False' to avoid reading the file unnecessarily`. I initially thought it was related to this problem but I found out just before making this report is wasn't: another case to include the state-id in log-messages)
