Hello! I'm using Salt v2014.7.0rc3.
The state module `apache_module` is returning planned changes in test mode incorrectly.
It should be outputted in yellow and as a planned change, but it's actually returned as succeeded state.
With suppressed success messages I wouldn't be getting a hint that an Apache module will be set to be enabled or disabled.
