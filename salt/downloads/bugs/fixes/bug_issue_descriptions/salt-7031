When you go to change flags in portage with the portage_config.flags and the package is not found when doing dependancy resolution you get a stacktrace. It should report something along the lines of atom not found.

```
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/portage_config.py", line 34, in _flags_helper
    new_flags = __salt__['portage_config.get_missing_flags'](conf, atom, new_flags)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/portage_config.py", line 366, in get_missing_flags
    if not has_flag(conf, atom, flag):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/portage_config.py", line 353, in has_flag
    if flag in get_flags_from_package_conf(conf, atom):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/portage_config.py", line 325, in get_flags_from_package_conf
    match_list = set(_porttree().dbapi.xmatch("match-all", atom))
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/portage/dbapi/porttree.py", line 780, in xmatch
    mykey = mydep.cp
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'cp'
```
