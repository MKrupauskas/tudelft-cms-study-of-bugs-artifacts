## Summary

`salt-cloud`, when managing LXC containers, calls `lxc-clone` when told to _"clone_from"_ an existing container. Since LXC 2.0, this command no longer exists, so `salt-cloud` fails to create containers. The `lxc-clone` command has been replaced by `lxc-copy` with different options, so the module _lxc_ would have to be updated.
## Details
### LXC 2.0

In LXC **version >= 2.0**, the `lxc-clone` command used to clone existing containers previously has been replaced by a `lxc-copy` command with different optinos.

This is confirmed in the [LXC 2.0 release announcement](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/news/#highlights):

> All main LXC commands have now been rewritten in C [...] lxc-copy
> New lxc-copy command taking over the role of lxc-clone and lxc-start-ephemeral

Here are the links to the relevant man pages of old `lxc-clone` and new `lxc-copy` commands :
- [man lxc-copy](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/manpages//man1/lxc-copy.1.html)
- [man lxc-clone](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/manpages//man1/lxc-clone.1.html)
### Salt-Cloud
- salt-cloud initial [create()](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/lxc.py#L414)

```
    salt.utils.cloud.fire_event(
        'event', 'starting create',
        'salt/cloud/{0}/creating'.format(vm_['name']),
        {'name': vm_['name'], 'profile': profile,
         'provider': vm_['driver'], },
        transport=__opts__['transport'])
```
- ... calls _utils/cloud_ [fire_event()](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/cloud.py#L1719)
- ... which calls _utils/event_ [fire_event()](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/event.py#L629)
- ... and I kinda lost the track here

At the end it ends up calling _modules/lxc_ [clone()](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b642b951802f0e421323f485c6272c0eb8c63f68/salt/modules/lxc.py#L1999) which directly [calls `lxc-clone`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b642b951802f0e421323f485c6272c0eb8c63f68/salt/modules/lxc.py#L2091), which doesn't exist on LXC 2.0 as explained above.

It's confirmed by the command output :

> Container could not be created with cmd 'lxc-clone  -o my-lxc-existing-container-name -n my-new-container-name -B dir'

The links to the code refer to the current HEAD of develop; on the version I'm using (2015.5.10) the code is slightly different (with `cmd = 'lxc-clone {0} -o {1} -n {2}'.format(snapshot, orig, name)` instead of building it incrementaly for example) but the problem is still the same.
## Suggested fix
- Gather an _lxc_version_ grain (I don't think it's already the case, isn't it ?)
- Change behavior depending on this grain value : `lxc-clone` when < 2.0; and `lxc-copy` with adapted arguments when >= 2.0. There is, in my opinion, 2 ways to do this :
  - Implement this conditionnal behavior right in the existing `clone()` function
  - Implement another `copy()` function to keep the existing LXC distinction, and call it conditionnaly (but I'm no idea where the `clone()` is currently being clone from :( )

**I'm ready and would like to implement this and submit the PR for it if that's ok with you guys/girls.**

In this case, I would to know what option you prefer regarding the implementation of the conditional behavior.
## Informations/Context
### Setup
- LXC 2.0
- Salt-Cloud creating LXC containers through cloning
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
#### Provider

```
$ cat /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/my-lxc-provider.conf
my-lxc-provider:
  target: my-server-with-saltminion-and-lxc.example.org
  provider: lxc
  driver: lxc
```
#### Profile

```
$ cat /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/my-lxc-profile.conf
my-lxc-profile:
  provider: my-lxc-provider
  lxc_profile:
    clone_from: my-lxc-existing-container-name
  minion:
    master: my-master.example.org
```
#### Command

```
salt-cloud -p my-lxc-profile my-new-container-name
```
#### Output

```
$ salt-cloud -p my-lxc-profile my-new-container-name
