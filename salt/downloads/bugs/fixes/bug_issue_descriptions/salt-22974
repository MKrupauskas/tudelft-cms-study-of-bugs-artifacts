In the past we have added several files to `_modules` and `_states`. Either to add functionality, to backport fixed/improved versions or simply to fix a bug (e.g. in the `iptables` module).

After upgrading to 2014.7.5 the iptables-workaround module started causing issues since its behavior has changed so we removed it from the master. The file still remained cached on the minions.

Further investigation shows several modules/states in `/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_modules` and `/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_states` which haven't been on the master for a long time.

With other words, it appears that the sync only syncs changed/added files but does not remove the one's that no longer exist.
