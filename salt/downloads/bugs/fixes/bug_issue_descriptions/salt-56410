### Description of Issue

Buggy code is here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/84c60708cd355f0b24742e8bcdba39073d24c9f8/salt/utils/templates.py#L127-L131

Short version, if name of the directory containing the sls is contained in sls name, tpldir calculation will return wrong result.

Slightly longer version, it seems to be trying to find the tplpath by looking for last occurrence of slspath in template name - without realizing it may occur later in the full template path.

This can be fixed by simply adding the basename of the template to the slspath - although I am not really sure what is the point of this code - seems like a complicated way to get what you already have in slspath....

### Setup

setup as file x/x.sls

```
test:
  test.nop:
    - name: {{ tpldir }}
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

* if you run the state above, you will get output of name to be `.` - which is incorrect
* if you rename that state file to anything without "x" in the name, it will return name 'x' (correct)
* if you name it anything with x in the name, you will have a problem
* if you move it to x/x/x.sls - you will get "x" - which is, again, incorrect
* if you move it to x/x/y.sls - you will get "x/x" - which is correct
