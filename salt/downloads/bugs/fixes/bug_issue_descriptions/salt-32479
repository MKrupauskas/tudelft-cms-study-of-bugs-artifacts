Orchestration/state.orchestrate gives exception when a target listed in the orchestration file does not exist.

Expecting that the exception would be handled and a helpful message displayed instead.

Here's an example orchestration file being used. In this case the target `'app*'` does not exist in the environment.
`orch.sls`

```
htop:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'app*'
    - sls:
      - htop

install_vim:
 salt.state:
   - tgt: '*'
   - sls:
     - vim

cmd.run:
  salt.function:
    - tgt: '*'
    - arg:
      - rm -rf /tmp/foo  
```

Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run the above listed orchestration file in an env where the target of `app*` does not exist. 
2. Here is the command being run: `salt-run state.orchestrate orchestrate.orch`
3. The following exception is printed to the screen:

```
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
[ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1703, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1649, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/saltmod.py", line 225, in state
    cmd_ret = __salt__['saltutil.cmd'](tgt, fun, **cmd_kw)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 894, in cmd
    client, tgt, fun, arg, timeout, expr_form, ret, kwarg, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 862, in _exec
    for ret_comp in _cmd(**cmd_kwargs):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 686, in cmd_iter
    self._clean_up_subscriptions(pub_data['jid'])
KeyError: 'jid'
```
1. Keep in mind that the other states listed in the orchestration file get run due to the target `'*'` and if the target `app*` does exist there are no errors.
