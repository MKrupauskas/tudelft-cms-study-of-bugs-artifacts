### Description of Issue
When you apply mongodb_user.present for an existing user modifying his roles and/or his password, it applies changes even when applying with Test=true. If it's a new user everything works as it should, but when updating an existing user not.

### Setup
```
mongodb::user::creation::user::database:
  mongodb_user.present:
    - name: user
    - passwd: password
    - database: database
    - user: admin
    - password: adminpassword
    - authdb: admin
    - host: localhost
    - port: 27017
    - roles:
      - readAnyDatabase
      - readWriteAnyDatabase
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
# salt-call  -l debug state.apply test=true
[INFO    ] Running state [user] at time 13:24:43.477722
[INFO    ] Executing state mongodb_user.present for [user]
[INFO    ] Creating user user
[INFO    ] User user is already present
[INFO    ] Completed state [user] at time 13:24:43.582054 (duration_in_ms=104.331)
-----
  Name: user - Function: mongodb_user.present - Result: Clean
Summary for local
--------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:      0
--------------
Total states run:     1
```
When applying states using test=true, even if it shows that "nothing has happened", mongodb user has been modified at MongoDb server. Due to mongodb_user.present state code, it doesn't display any log message when mongodb user already exists.
