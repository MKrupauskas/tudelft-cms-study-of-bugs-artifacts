With a setup like Master->Syndic->Minion when running 'salt Minion state.highstate' on the Master I'm happy that it actually does the right thing on the minion but the output is not generated using the highstate outputter. e.g.

```
Minion:
    ----------
    cmd_|-/usr/sbin/logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.conf_|-/usr/sbin/logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.conf_|-wait:
        ----------
        __run_num__:
            24
        changes:
            ----------
        comment:

        name:
            /usr/sbin/logrotate -v /etc/logrotate.conf
        result:
            True
```

This doesn't affect minions attached directly to the Master
