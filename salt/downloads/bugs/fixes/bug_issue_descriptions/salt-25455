## Repro steps

1) Place alargefile (100MB or so) on srv/salt on master
2) Run 

```
salt 'minionname' cp.get_url salt://alargefile /tmp/alargefile
```

3) watch /tmp/alargefile on the minion. For me, this transfer was going around 1MB a minute (very slow).

I don't know how this may or may not be related to earlier issue #24048 - since apparently tornado is no longer required and I don't have it installed (if I believe salt --versions).
