I don't have time to track this down right now but I don't want to forget about it:

The following state throws a `KeyError` when trying to fire an event:

``` yaml
mysqld:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - name: mysql-server

selinux_permissive:
  cmd.run:
    - name: setenforce permissive
    - prereq:
      - pkg: mysqld

selinux_enforcing:
  cmd.wait:
    - name: setenforce enforcing
    - watch_in:
      - pkg: mysqld
```

``` python
Traceback (most recent call last):
