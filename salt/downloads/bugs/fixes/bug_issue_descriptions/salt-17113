With fresh salt (Hydrogen) on debian wheezy I can't use partition.set as expected:

```
* salt '*' partition.set /dev/sda 2 raid on
```

results in

```
* ERROR: Invalid state passed to partition.set
```

Python-code looks correct expecting {on / off}.

partition.mkpart does more than it should as

```
* salt '*' partition.mkpart /dev/sda primary ext2 2048s 4095s
```

sets the name of the partition to "primary" as well.
