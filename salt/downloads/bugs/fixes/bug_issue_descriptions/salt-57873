... given as strings quietly end up as character lists, e.g. `module_dirs: /foo`, ends up being used as `['/', 'f', 'o', 'o']`.  Are there situations where this is desirable?  Treating this case as invalid, or maybe converting list options given as strings to one-item lists seems like it would be more expected.

**Setup**

See above.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

See above.

**Expected behavior**

Single strings provided to list options are either converted to one-item lists, or rejected.

**Versions Report**

v3001.

**Additional context**

The current behaviour led to a time-consuming Support case.
