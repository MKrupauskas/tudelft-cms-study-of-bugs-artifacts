The timeout options such as 'WAIT_FOR_PASSWD_MAXTRIES' found in https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/misc.html#connection-timeout are no longer recognized in salt 2015.8.1 in either provider or profile configurations.

Per the current documentation and in previous Saltstack releases this was accepted. I've tested lower case 'wait_for_passwd_maxtries' and this does work. Ideally the regression should be addressed or documentation updated to reflect the change.
