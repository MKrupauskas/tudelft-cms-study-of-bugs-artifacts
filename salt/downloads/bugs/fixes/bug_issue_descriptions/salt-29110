Hi guys,

First I would like to thank you for this awesome piece of software.

Upgrading my master server to 2015.8.2 broke the orchestrator for me, even a simple:

``` salt
nginx:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'any server'
    - sls: websites.deploy.nginx
```

State file:

``` salt
/usr/local/etc/nginx/sites:
  file.directory:
    - makedirs: True
```

would not work. I get the following:

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'm_state' referenced before assignment
```

I'm running FreeBSD and everything was built through poudriere. Even a fresh server didn't work

I found a backup version of 2015.8.1 and restored it to the new server and now it's working

Thanks in advance
