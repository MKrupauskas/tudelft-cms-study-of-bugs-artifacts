### Description of Issue
I'm trying to use this method to mount my filesystems because I want to use the UUID in fstab, but I've noticed that fstab is changed but no filesystem is mounted.

### Setup
```
disk_format_sdb:
  blockdev.formatted:
    - name: /dev/sdb
    - fs_type: xfs
    - require:
      - pkg: disks_pkgs

disk_mount_db:
  file.directory:
    - name: /server
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - file_mode: 644
    - dir_mode: 777
  mount.fstab_present:
    - name: /dev/sdb
    - fs_file: /server
    - fs_vfstype: xfs
    - mount: True
    - fs_mntops:
      - defaults
    - mount_by: uuid
    - require:
      - blockdev: disk_format_sdb
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just use the provided state with an empty of already formated disk.

You can see how the fstab is changed but filesystem is not mounted:
```
----------
          ID: disk_mount_sdb
    Function: mount.fstab_present
        Name: /dev/sdb
      Result: True
     Comment: /server entry added in /etc/fstab.
     Started: 13:16:41.941678
    Duration: 7.495 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              persist:
                  new
```

If you run the mount -a command then is mounted without problem:
```
# mount|grep -i "server"
# mount -a
# mount|grep -i "server"
/dev/sdb on /server type xfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,attr2,inode64,noquota)
```

Both (minion and master) uses the same OS and Salt version.

I've tried to use also the mounted state getting the filesystem UUID, but on first run when it has to format the disk, the UUID doesn't exists yet so it fails.


For now I've created a way to do it with this state:
```
disk_mount_sdb:
  file.directory:
    - name: /server
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - file_mode: 644
    - dir_mode: 777
  mount.fstab_present:
    - name: /dev/sdb
    - fs_file: /server
    - fs_vfstype: ext4
    - mount: True
    - fs_mntops:
      - defaults
    - mount_by: uuid
    - require:
      - blockdev: disk_format_sdb
  cmd.run:
    - name: mount /server
    - onlyif: exit $(mount|grep /dev/sdb|grep /server|wc -l)
    - require:
      - blockdev: disk_format_sdb
```
