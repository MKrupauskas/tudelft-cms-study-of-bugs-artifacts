Hey,

I'm trying to install a ssh public key on a ubuntu 12.04 machine for a user unison. The keys are generated with PuTtyGen on a windows machine. The home directory of user unison has a .ssh-dir with nothing inside. When I run bighstate by 

salt-call --local state.highstate -l debug 
## with the following state:

```
ssh-key-unison: 
  ssh_auth:
    - present
    - user: unison
    - source: salt://unison/public_key_unison.id_rsa.pub
    - enc: ssh-rsa
```

---

ant this contents of public_key_unison.id_rsa.pub:

---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
Comment: "rsa-key-20130723"

---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----

the output of salt is: 

---

```
State: - ssh_auth
Name:      ssh-key-unison
Function:  present
    Result:    True
    Comment:   The authorized host key ssh-key-unison is already present for user unison
    Changes:
```

That is not true. The ~/.ssh of user unison is empty! 

Best regards,
