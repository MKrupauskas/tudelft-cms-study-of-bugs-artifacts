### Description of Issue/Question
When attempting to pass pillar data to salt.state in orch a warning:

Error 1:

[salt.client.mixins][CRITICAL][14741]  'kwargs must be passed inside the low data within the 'kwarg' key. See usage of salt.utils.args.parse_input() and salt.minion.load_args_and_kwargs() elsewhere in the codebase.'

and the sls targeted by salt.state fails to execute because pillar data was not properly passed.
The documentation within [reactor](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/reactor/#advanced-state-system-capabilities) documentation suggests you should now have:
``` 
- kwarg
      pillar:
        bar
``` 
This is not mirrored in the[ salt.states.saltmod ](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.saltmod.html#salt.states.saltmod.state)

So when you change to the new format orch now throws a different error for salt.state when this is fixed (i.e changed to the above).

Error2:

`'kwarg' is an invalid keyword argument for 'salt.state'. If you were trying to pass additional data to be used in a template context, please populate 'context' with 'key: value' pairs. Your approach will work until Salt Oxygen is out. Please update your state files.`

and the sls targeted by salt.state fails to execute.

### Setup
Fails due to Error 1:
```
run_foo_state:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: '*'
    - sls:
      - foo
    - pillar:
        event_bar: bar
```
Fails due to Error 2:
```
run_example_state:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: '*'
    - sls:
      - foo
    - kwarg:
        pillar:
          event_bar: bar
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run either state example using runner.orchestrate
