**Description**
Problem using zabbix_mediatype.present due to API changes on zabbix 4.4

**Setup**

Using SALT 3000.1.
Downloaded the git modules to test new code as well.

When trying to create a new mediatype with zabbix_mediatype.present, salt wont do it, instead, it updates whatever is the first mediatype already created on zabbix.

For example, if there is 3 media types in the following order: Email, Script, SMS.
Salt, pickup the Email mediatype, and update that mediatype with the parameters of my state.
```
zabbix-media-xxx:
  zabbix_mediatype.present:
    - name: 'Testing'
    - mediatype: 1
    - exec_params: "{ALERT.SENDTO}\n{ALERT.SUBJECT}\n{ALERT.MESSAGE}"
    - exec_path: testing.sh
    - description: 'Whatever Needed'
    - status: 0
```
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Just try to create a new mediatype (using the zabbix_mediatype.present state), using zabbix version 4.4 or higher.

**Current behavior**
It won't create a new mediatype, instead it will change configuration of an already created one at zabbix. It will pickup the first mediatype on the list[0].

**Additional context**
Already evaluated that. There is a new attribute for mediatype. 
So in the past (until zabbix 4.4) the module used to use "description" attribute as "name", to make the call of zabbix.mediatype_get and zabbix.mediatype_create. So, as there is a new attribute called "name", it wont filter the appropriate field.
