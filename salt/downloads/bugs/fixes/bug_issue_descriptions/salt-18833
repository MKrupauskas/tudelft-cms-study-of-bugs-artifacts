I was highstating a minion over `salt-ssh` and noticed an odd return:

```
          ID: /opt/zabbix/scripts
    Function: file.recurse
      Result: True
     Comment: Recursively updated /opt/zabbix/scripts
     Started: 12:42:03.232921
    Duration: 190.06 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              /opt/zabbix/scripts/iscover_vhosts.php:
                  ----------
                  diff:
                      New file
                  group:
                      zabbix
                  mode:
                      0755
                  user:
                      zabbix
```

The file should be `/opt/zabbix/scripts/discover_vhosts.php` but the first character is missing in the log output. The file exists with the missing 'd' both on the master and the minion.

Master specs (on Ubuntu 14.04):

The target node is also Ubuntu 14.04 and has no Salt packages since its deployed via `salt-ssh`.
