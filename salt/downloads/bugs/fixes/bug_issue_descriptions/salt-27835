Hello,

I am a heavy user of salt-ssh, however when targeting a FreeBSD host at random points it will hang and a process tree such as following shows up:

```
| \-+= 34706 root sshd: root@notty (sshd)
|   \-+= 34708 root csh -c /bin/sh
|     \-+- 34710 root /usr/local/bin/python2.7 -c -c
|       \-+- 34715 root /usr/local/bin/python2.7 /tmp/.root_89c8ec_salt/salt-call --local --metadata --out json -l quiet -c /tmp/.root_89c8ec_salt -- state.pkg /tmp/.root_89c8ec_salt/salt_state.tgz test=None
|         \--- 35482 root <defunct>
```

It ran some command, and that command exited, but salt didn't get that information, or something else went wrong.

How can I debug this? What is the best way to get a log file from the minion when using salt-ssh? Is there a way to tell the minion to log debug information somewhere?

I see #16417 does this mean there is not some way to do this yet? It would be awesome if for example even with "wipe dir" if `-l trace` or `-l debug` is specified locally that it leaves a log file in /tmp/ that can then be transferred to the local "master" with an `scp` after the run is complete.
