**Description**
It seems black is changing the file mode of a unit test file while being committed. pylint then fails when checking the file mode.

**Setup**
Modify a test file, e.g. tests/unit/modules/test_tuned.py

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
git add/commit

To confirm the issue, I opened another terminal and ran:
`chmod 0644 tests/unit/modules/test_tuned.py` repeatedly while the commit/pre-commit process ran and got past the pylint failure regarding file mode.

File mode was directly confirmed before and after the tests and after being changed via `chmod`.

**Expected behavior**
Tests process normally, especially one test does not cause another to fail.
