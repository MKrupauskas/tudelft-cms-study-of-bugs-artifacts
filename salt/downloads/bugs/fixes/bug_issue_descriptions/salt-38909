### Description of Issue/Question
If I follow the documentation for this beacon and put the snippet in `/etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf`:
```
beacons:
 memusage:
    - percent: 63%
```
The beacons works fine. However, I prefer using the state configuration, and hence I did put in my `bootstrap.sls` state the following:
```
beacons_fun:
  beacon.present:
    - enable: True
    - name: load
    - 1m:
      - 0.0
      - 2.0
    - 5m:
      - 0.0
      - 1.5
    - 15m:
      - 0.1
      - 1.0

# beacons no fun, this won't work  
memusage:
  beacon.present:
    - percent: 3%
```
After running the state I see the following on the master:
```
# salt "mi*1*" beacons.list
minion1.local:
    beacons:
      load:
        15m:
        - 0.1
        - 1.0
        1m:
        - 0.0
        - 2.0
        5m:
        - 0.0
        - 1.5
        enable: true
      memusage:
        enable: true
        percent:
        - 3%
```
Which seems fine, but the logs on the minion show:
```
2017-01-24 09:48:08,475 [salt.loaded.int.beacons.load][DEBUG   ][30134] Emit because 0.04 < 0.1 or > 1.0
2017-01-24 09:48:08,476 [salt.minion      ][CRITICAL][30134] The beacon errored: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 2153, in handle_beacons
    beacons = self.process_beacons(self.functions)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 409, in process_beacons
    return self.beacons.process(b_conf, self.opts['grains'])  # pylint: disable=no-member
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/beacons/__init__.py", line 100, in process
    raw = self.beacons[fun_str](b_config[mod])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/beacons/memusage.py", line 64, in beacon
    mount = memusage.keys()[0]
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'keys'
```

So my question is - how do I configure this beacon to work properly within the state?
