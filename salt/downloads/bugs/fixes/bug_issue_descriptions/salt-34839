### Description of Issue/Question

I'm using the `npm.boostrap` state, and since it requires npm/nodejs to be installed to work, I have the `npm.bootstrap` state require the `pkg.installed` step for installing `nodejs`.

I expect the `npm.bootstrap` state to succeed since it runs after `nodejs` gets installed, but it always fails on the very first `state.highstate` run due to:

```
Reason: 'npm' __virtual__ returned False: 'npm' binary not found on system
```

I suspect this is due to the LazyLoader trying to load the `npm.bootstrap` module way too early (before `nodejs` is installed), and therefore caching the failure for the rest of the run, causing all `npm` modules to fail. I'm not sure how LazyLoader works though.

The second time I run `state.highstate` it works fine since the module detects the existence of `npm` correctly. The strange part is that if I try to manually uninstall the `nodejs` package and run `state.highstate` again, it detects `npm` correctly, and I can no longer repro. The only time the issue arises is on the first `state.highstate` on a fresh box.
### Setup

 I have the following states setup:

```
nodejs:
  pkg.latest

nodejs-repo:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: apt-transport-https
    - require_in:
      - pkgrepo: nodejs-repo
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: NodeSource Node.js Repository
    - name: "deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_5.x {{ grains['oscodename'] }} main"
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
    - key_url: https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key
    - require_in:
      pkg: nodejs

npm-pkgs:
  npm.bootstrap:
    - name: {{ some_path_here }}
    - user: {{ some_user_here }}
    - watch:
      - pkg: nodejs
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Using the above SLS files, try to `salt-call state.highstate` and see it fail to run `npm.bootstrap` due to:

```

Using `-l debug` there's a message about the LazyLoader failing to load the module, but this happens way before it gets to installing `nodejs`:

```
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded npm.bootstrap
[ERROR   ] State 'npm.bootstrap' was not found in SLS 'webstack.website'
Reason: 'npm' __virtual__ returned False: 'npm' binary not found on system
```
