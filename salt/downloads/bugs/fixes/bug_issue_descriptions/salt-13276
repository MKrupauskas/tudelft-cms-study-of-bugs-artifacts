_The way it is now:_

If I have this in users.sls:

```
myuser:
  user.present:
    - fullname: My User
    - shell: /bin/bash
    - home: /home/myuser
    - createhome: True
```

And I run salt.highstate, I get this error:

```
          ID: server1
    Function: user.present
      Result: False
     Comment: These values could not be changed: {'groups': []}
     Changes: 
```

What's happening is that, since I didn't give salt an explicit "groups:" directive, it's attempting to remove the user from all groups, which of course fails.

_What should happen instead:_

If no groups: directive is present in a users.present item, then it should be treated as remove_groups=False.  What the admin is de-facto saying is "salt, don't manage groups for me".

This also trips up Salt admins when they've set optional_groups but not groups.
