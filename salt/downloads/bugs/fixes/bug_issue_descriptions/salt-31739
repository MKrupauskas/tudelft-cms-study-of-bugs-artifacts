### Description of Issue/Question

When salt is run in batch mode, there is no way to know which minions were offline/unresponsive during the run, some kind of error message would be nice so the state could be rerun when they come online.

Here is an example... we have 1 live minion, and bunch more which are offline. When I run salt in batch mode against them i get one return, but I have no idea which minions the salt did not run on.

```
[root@salt-devops salt]# salt -b 1  --show-jid 'node00*' test.ping
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/Crypto/Util/number.py:57: PowmInsecureWarning: Not using mpz_powm_sec.  You should rebuild using libgmp >= 5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability.
  _warn("Not using mpz_powm_sec.  You should rebuild using libgmp >= 5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability.", PowmInsecureWarning)

Executing run on ['node002.cluster.aws.example.com']

node002.cluster.aws.example.com:
    True
retcode:
    0
```

I expect output similiar to this, it tells me how many minions failed to run the state:

```
[root@salt-devops salt]# salt 'node00*' test.ping
/usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/Crypto/Util/number.py:57: PowmInsecureWarning: Not using mpz_powm_sec.  You should rebuild using libgmp >= 5 to avoid timing attack vulnerability.
