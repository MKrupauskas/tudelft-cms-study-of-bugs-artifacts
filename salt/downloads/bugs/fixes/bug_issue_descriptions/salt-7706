I use `client_acl` on the salt-master to give my normal user account access to run all salt commands:

```
client_acl:
  cwright:
    - .*
```

However, after upgrading from 0.16.4 to 0.17.0 (via Ubuntu packages) I am now unable to run commands as the `cwright` user, and I receive this error:

```
$ salt '*' test.ping
Failed to open log file, do you have permission to write to /var/log/salt/master
```

Users listed in `client_acl` should be able to run salt commands without requiring filesystem level permission to write to `/var/log/salt/master`.
