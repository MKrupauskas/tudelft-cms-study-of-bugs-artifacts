### Description of Issue/Question

The Slack engine is unable to obtain a user list from Slack due to the number of users within the workspace. A HTTP 500 error (hphp_invoke) is being thrown. 

Slack recommends the use of pagination for large searches.
https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list#pagination

Looking at the 2017.7.3 and develop code branches, the utils/slack.py is performing a lookup with "token" as the only option.

### Setup
Vanilla Salt Master install, Python `slackclient` installed, with the following engine config:

/etc/salt/master.d/slack.conf file:
```
engines:
  - slack:
      token: 'xoxb-'
      control: True
      valid_commands:
        - jobs.list_jobs
      aliases:
        list_jobs:
          cmd: jobs.list_jobs
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

From salt-master -l debug:

```
[DEBUG   ] https://slack.com/api/users.list
[DEBUG   ] {'token': 'xoxb-'}
[DEBUG   ] None
[DEBUG   ] {'status': 500, 'error': 'HTTP 500: hphp_invoke'}
```
