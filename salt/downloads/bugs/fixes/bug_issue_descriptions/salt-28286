When referencing an s3:// source for file hashes an error message will be emitted stating that the file format should be 'hashtype=hash', even when the file is provided in that format.

The documentation states that it must be 'hash filename' which does seem to work.

Looking through salt/module/file.py, there seems to be some cases that require the previous format still.

Not sure which is correct, but the documented format seems to work for s3:// sources.
