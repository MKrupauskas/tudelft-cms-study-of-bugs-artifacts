### Description of Issue/Question

When running 2016.3 I'm seeing quite a few of the following:

```
[DEBUG   ] Gathering reactors for tag salt/auth
[ERROR   ] Bad load from minion: AuthenticationError: message authentication failed
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[ERROR   ] Bad load from minion: AuthenticationError: message authentication failed
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[ERROR   ] Bad load from minion: AuthenticationError: message authentication failed
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[ERROR   ] Bad load from minion: AuthenticationError: message authentication failed
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
[ERROR   ] Bad load from minion: AuthenticationError: message authentication failed
[DEBUG   ] Failed to authenticate message
```

I see this both during normal operation as well as when I restart. Ultimately the master stops responding to minion requests and requires a restart.

Running in debug mode has not revealed any extra information as of yet.
### Setup

Ubuntu 14.04
Saltstack 2016.3.0rc2
Multi-master enabled
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

With over 500 minions connected to a master watch the logs. I have highstate running every 30 min from each minion with a splay of 100.
