Have a formula defined for configuring `yum-cron` on EL6. After I've applied the config-mods to `/etc/sysconfig/yum-config`, I have a service.running state configured like:

```
svc-yum_cron:
  service.running:
    - name: 'yum-cron'
    - enable: 'True'
    - watch:
      - file: '/etc/sysconfig/yum-config'
```

The state properly detects the updates to the file and runs the `service.running`:

```
[...elided...]
----------
          ID: svc-yum_cron
    Function: service.running
        Name: yum-cron
      Result: True
     Comment: Service restarted
     Started: 01:44:19.982357
    Duration: 35.964 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              yum-cron:
                  True

Summary for local
-------------
Succeeded: 15 (changed=11)
Failed:     0
-------------
```

however, a check of the service's boot-time enablement shows that it didn't actually get enabled:

```
# salt-call --local -l info service.enabled yum-cron    [INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/chkconfig --list yum-cron' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/runlevel' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/runlevel' in directory '/root'
local:
    False
[root@ses-test yum-cron]# chkconfig --list yum-cron
yum-cron        0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off
```

This feels like a bug, but wanted to make sure I wasn't misreading the documentation.
