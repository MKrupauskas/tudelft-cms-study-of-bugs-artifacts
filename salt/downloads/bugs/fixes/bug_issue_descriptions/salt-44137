### Description of Issue/Question
Nodegroups defined as N@other_nodegroup where other_nodegroup is defined as a list fail targeting with
```$ salt -N test test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```

### Setup
Define in `master.d/nodegroups.conf` something akin to:

```
  lower:
    - server1
    - server2
    - server3
  test: N@lower
```
Then try to invoke from the CLI `salt -N test test.ping` - it'll fail with the above error message.

Further, the master logs:
```
2017-10-16 23:13:13,707 [salt.utils.minions][ERROR   ][19741] Invalid compound target: ['(', '(', 'server1', 'server2', 'server3', ')', ')']
```
