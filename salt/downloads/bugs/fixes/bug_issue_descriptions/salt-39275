### Description of Issue/Question
It turns out that the cache backend fech() function gets hit a *LOT*. When I put consul as a cache backend in an env with ~200 minions, salt became unusable due to the consul process getting overloaded.
When I put a print statement in the fetch() function, it seems it gets called 400+ times *per minion*, making the consul backend essentially unusable.

### Setup
set `cache: consul` in the master config and count the number you hit fetch() in salt/cache/consul.py
