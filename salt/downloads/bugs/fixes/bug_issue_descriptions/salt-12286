i ran a highstate using test=True and it unmounted my mountpoint!
(first part yellow, second part cyan [which made me suspicious])

```
----------
          ID: /data-remote
    Function: mount.mounted
      Result: None
     Comment: /data-remote would be mounted
     Changes:   
              ----------
              umount:
                  Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: nfs1:/data, current: nfs2:/data/, /nfs2:/data/

```
