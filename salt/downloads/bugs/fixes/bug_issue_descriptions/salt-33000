### Description of Issue/Question

virtualenv.managed does not change directory as specified by cwd
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

```
/srv/test/virtualenv:
  file.directory:
    - user: vagrant
    - group: vagrant
    - mode: 755
    - makedirs: True
  virtualenv.managed:
    - system_site_packages: False
    - pip_upgrade: True
    - python: python3.5
    - user: vagrant
    - cwd: /vagrant
    - requirements: /vagrant/requirements-dev.txt

```

The requirements file contains following:
`-r requirements.txt`

Which works normally, but salt reports:

```
----------
          ID: /srv/sciencegraph/virtualenv
    Function: virtualenv.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: virtualenv exists
              Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/requirements.txt'
              Storing debug log for failure in /home/vagrant/.pip/pip.log
     Started: 03:11:55.808161
    Duration: 828.437 ms
     Changes:   
```

Which is definitely the wrong cwd.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use virtualenv.managed cwd argument
