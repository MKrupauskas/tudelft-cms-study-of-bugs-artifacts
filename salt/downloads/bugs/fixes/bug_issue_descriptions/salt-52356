My first attempt was in this issue: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/52319

It was closed because I used `example.com` to hide my own git server. wtf.
I can reproduce the problem now. And I would like to help to get this fixed.

`pygit2 0.28.0` installed with `pip` produces errors like that:

```
2019-03-29 10:36:49,880 [salt.utils.gitfs :1437][ERROR   ][2001] Unable to get SHA of HEAD for git_pillar remote 'master https://github.com/x70b1/pillar.git'

```

This is my master config:
(I set up a public repo to make sure that this is not a problem with a non-extisting server)

```
ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - master https://github.com/x70b1/pillar.git:
      - env: base
```
I see this on a debian system:
