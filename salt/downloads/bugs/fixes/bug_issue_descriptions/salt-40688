### Description of Issue/Question
The syslog returner raises a TypeException when calling syslog.openlog in Python 2.6.  This is because the syslog.openlog function does not accept keyword arguments in that Python version.

While I'd like to dismiss this because Python 2.6 is deprecated, there are unfortunately a lot of enterprises still stuck on CentOS 6, and Salt doesn't yet provide a way to specify which Python interpreter to use.

### Setup
Fresh salt installation from using Yum from the saltstack repo.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
This affects any command that uses the syslog returner. The command executes and returns to stdout normally, but nothing ends up in syslog. 

Example:
```
salt-call --return syslog status.loadavg
local:
    ----------
    1-min:
        0.0
    15-min:
        0.06
    5-min:
        0.06
```

From /var/log/salt/minion:
```
