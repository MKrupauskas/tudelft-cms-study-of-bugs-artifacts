### Description of Issue/Question

The firewalld state is not implemented properly. Even if we select prune_services=False, it will still prune ports # and richrules. Please implement prune instead of just prune_services.  The introduction of pruning_services cause a lot of hazards for many admins few month ago. 

### Setup

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

### Versions Report
