If a state invokes file.symlink and explicitly specifies user: foo, the symlink is still created as root:root
Further re-runs of the state still ignores the user setting

Looking at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/file.py#L493 , the actual symlink creation is delegated to os.symlink(), and the "user" argument is discarded.
