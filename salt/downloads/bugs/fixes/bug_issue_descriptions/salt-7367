I have a schedule configured via pillar to have my minions run `status.uptime` every few minutes. I have this configured to return via the mysql returner, but nothing is added to the database. Either the schedule isn't running, or the returner isn't working (although it works manually).

``` shell
[root@summer ~]# salt --versions-report
           Salt: 0.16.3
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jul 10 2013, 22:48:45)

       pycrypto: 2.0.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 2.2.0.1
            ZMQ: 3.2.3

[root@summer pillar]# tree

 uptime.sls

[root@summer pillar]# cat uptime.sls 
schedule:
  uptime:

```
