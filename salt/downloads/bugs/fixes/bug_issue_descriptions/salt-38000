### Description of Issue/Question
saltutil.runner is now returning a different dict structure to older Salt versions, which caused the majority of my reactors to break.

### Setup
On 2016.3.4 my reactors were working by calling the following function:
<pre>{% set my_variable = salt['saltutil.runner']('pillar.show_pillar', minion='minion')['pillar-key'] %}</pre>

After upgrade to 2016.11.0 I got the following error when reactors were being rendered:
<pre>SaltRenderError: Jinja variable 'dict object' has no attribute 'pillar-key'</pre>

To access the pillar data successfully I had to include the 'return' key for the dict:
<pre>{% set my_variable = salt['saltutil.runner']('pillar.show_pillar', minion='minion')['return']['pillar-key'] %}</pre>

I've had a look through the release notes and I don't think anything like this is documented.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Attempt to read pillar data from a Jinja2 based reactor with:
<pre>salt['saltutil.runner']('pillar.show_pillar', minion='minion')['pillar-key']</pre>
