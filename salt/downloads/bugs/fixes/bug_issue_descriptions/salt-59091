**Description**
When using pkg.installed the order is not respected.
So using pkg.installed in one state and pkg.installed in another, saltstack tries to install both packages during the first state.

**Setup**
top.sls
```
base:
  'server':
    - php
    - state1
    - state2
```

php/init.sls
```
php_repository:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Ondrej PPA PHP Repo
    - ppa: ondrej/php

php5.6:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - pkgs:
      - php5.6-cli
      - php5.6-fpm
      - php5.6-apcu
      - php5.6-common
      - php5.6-mysql
      - php5.6-curl
      - php5.6-soap
      - php5.6-xml
      - php5.6-mcrypt
      - php5.6-mbstring
      - php5.6-gd
```

state1/init.sls
```
state1_pkg_install:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - package1: 0.1.2
```


state2/init.sls
```
state2_pkg_install:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - package2: 0.1.2
```


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
sudo salt-call state.highstate test=True
```

result

    Function: pkg.installed

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is that first, all packages of php/init.sls are installed. Then in a seperate step the packages of state1/init.sls and finally the packages of state2/init.sls are installed.
The packages need a certain order to work. So grouping them all together in one step is not working. Especially when creating folders, permission or certain files in between.
