This change: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/9a891de88777e0c7cfa8fa156e6d2cc2c597ac6c made size a mandatory item for all providers, however size has no meaning on Softlayer VMs

Salt cloud now fails with the following errors

However rolling back just that single change results in this error 

```
