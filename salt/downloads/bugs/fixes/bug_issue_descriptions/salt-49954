### Description of Issue/Question
This issue was originally seen while validating #49866 and I noted that this behavior should be tracked in a separate issue, thus here we are. 

In summary, Ruby gem installs support specifying version dependencies using symbols like `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `~>` (this may not be the full list...). However, the salt `gem.installed` state only does direct string compares of the `version` field against the list of versions already installed when determining whether the state needs to run or not. Thus, not only is any version dependency symbology not taken into account, it also will break the string compare and cause the state to always run. Once it runs, however, the underlying `gem` call will properly interpret the dependency symbology.

This issue is therefore a request for salt to support the nuances of acceptable `gem` version dependency symbology in determining whether a `gem.installed` state should run or not.

### Setup
This is the usual case which is supported:
```
json Gem Installed:
  gem.installed:
    - name: json
    - version: '2.1.0'
```
results in:
```
[INFO    ] Running state [json] at time 19:21:40.010850
[INFO    ] Executing state gem.installed for [json]
[INFO    ] Executing command ['gem', 'list', 'json'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: json (default: 2.1.0)
[INFO    ] Executing command ['/usr/local/rbenv/bin/rbenv', 'rehash'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] versions is ['2.1.0'], version is 2.1.0
[INFO    ] Gem is already installed.
```
(Note: fix for #49866 has been manually applied to allow this use case to succeed with the `default: ` prefix in the stdout above)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
If we modify the working case by adding a `>=` to the `version`:
```
json Gem Installed:
  gem.installed:
    - name: json
    - version: '>= 2.1.0'
```
it will fail the string compare and always (re)install (the proper version of) the gem:
```
[INFO    ] Running state [json] at time 20:03:47.455722
[INFO    ] Executing state gem.installed for [json]
[INFO    ] Executing command ['gem', 'list', 'json'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: json (default: 2.1.0, 2.0.4)
[INFO    ] Executing command ['/usr/local/rbenv/bin/rbenv', 'rehash'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] versions is ['2.1.0', '2.0.4'], version is >= 2.1.0
[INFO    ] Executing command ['gem', 'install', 'json', '--version', '>= 2.1.0', '--no-rdoc', '--no-ri'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: Building native extensions. This could take a while...
Successfully installed json-2.1.0
1 gem installed
```
