I discovered this while trying to use cmd.run via salt-ssh. Using zmq, I do this:

```
root@salt~:$ salt salt cmd.run "echo 'hi'"
salt:
    hi
```

But when I use salt-ssh this happens

```
root@salt~:$ salt-ssh salt cmd.run "echo 'hi'"
salt:
    Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
    stdin: is not a tty
    Error running 'cmd.run': Specified cwd 'hi' either not absolute or does not exist
```

This happens because the second positional argument to cmd.run is the cwd. I assume that it's probably the argument parser that's broken, though I suppose it could also be the salt ssh client?
