### Description of Issue/Question
It seems like the Cheetah template doesn't appear to work. The following exception is raised when trying to use it:

```
2019-02-19 11:34:09,030 [salt.state       :320 ][ERROR   ][6600] Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\utils\templates.py", line 175, in render_tmpl
    if salt.utils.stringutils.to_unicode(output, encoding=SLS_ENCODING).endswith(('\n', os.linesep)):
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\utils\stringutils.py", line 161, in to_unicode
    raise TypeError('expected str or bytearray')
TypeError: expected str or bytearray
```

### Setup
Just get setup to use `file.managed` with template set to Cheetah.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
One doesn't even need any template variables, just try and use the Cheetah state to render anything and this exception gets raised. This particular code in salt.utils.stringutils hasn't been touched in a year.

### Versions Report
Although this is an older version, the relevant code hasn't changed in a year. This seems to be a type error due to a string being assumed when it's an object of some sort. It's in a condition that checks to see if Windows is being used and if so to try and convert it to unicode or something..
