I had expected that salt read configuration files and switched to the user declared in /etc/salt/master like in other services, in fact it appears to switch very early on thus configuration files that were only readable by root were never readable by the user.  The server did not log this critical error to /var/log/salt/master by default.  

It wasn't until that I ran it in debug did I see the issue, specifically IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/salt/master' in salt-master -l all.  The fix was simple: chown -R [salt user] /etc/salt .  

The misconfiguration caused the salt minion to raise a SaltReqTimeoutError (even in -l all) even tho it could make TCP connections to the salt-master, and, as a test and perhaps another separate issue in and of itself, salt minion raises SaltReqTimeoutError even if the salt master refuses TCP connections.

I propose two fixes:  that salt-master's failure to read configuration files be raised better, and that salt-minion traps connection issues better rather than  raising a generic and red herring SaltReqTimeoutError. 

I'd be happy to help contribute these fixes but would need some assistance from an experienced salt contributor as I am new to salt.
