**Description**
the cmdmod functions look to all set saltenv to `base` instead of `None` and are not setting to `__opts__['saltenv']` when saltenv in passed as not set. this gives the effect that cmd.script will not pull from saltenv config unless you pass saltenv directly to the module. 

**Setup**
set saltenv in the config file of a minion to anything but base
add a file to the fileserver under the envrioment that you setup in the config.
make sure above file is NOT in the base enviroment. 


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
with above setup run `salt <minion> cmd.script salt://testfile.sls` will error since it can not find file in `base`.


**Expected behavior**
finds file in the saltenv set in config. instead of looking in base for file.
