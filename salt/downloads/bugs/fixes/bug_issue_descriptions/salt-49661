### Description of Issue/Question
Some incompatibility exists between openssl-1.1.1-1 and salt 2018.3.2-2. I am using Archlinux fully updated (pacman -Syu). Downgrading to openssl-1.1.0.i-1 solves the issue, but makes me worry about updating my system and breaking things again.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Any install should provide the same result. No special setups were used. The issue happens on fresh installs with the config files as default.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Fully update your system.
Check to see if openssl-1.1.1-1 has installed. If not, you may need to manually install it.
Stop any running instances of salt-master or salt-minion on the system.
Attempt to run systemctl start salt-minion or systemctl start salt-master.

```
journalctl -xe     # Post update and attempting to run systemctl start salt-master

```
Attempting to run from the command line rather than a service also fails.

```
salt-master -l debug

salt-master: error: Failed to load configuration: Failed to initialize OpenSSL library (OPENSSL_init_crypto failed)
```

Here is the newest version of openssl that I have confirmed working with salt

```
$ pacman -Qi openssl
Name            : openssl
Version         : 1.1.0.i-1
Description     : The Open Source toolkit for Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security
Architecture    : x86_64
URL             : https://www.openssl.org
Licenses        : custom:BSD

```


### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)

All O/S are fully updated and on the same version of salt. Attempting to get a version report while openssl-1.1.1-1  is installed gives the following error.

```

After downgrading to openssl-1.1.0.i-1, the report is as follows.
