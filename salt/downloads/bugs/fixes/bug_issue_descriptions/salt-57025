**Description**
I have been seeing failures on a few different functions that are using the `chocolatey.installed` module.

The error message regardless of the package is always in the form:
```
          ID: firefox
    Function: chocolatey.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

So far I have seen this error for the following packages: `sql-server-2019`, `dotnet4.7.2`, `sublimetext3` and `firefox` but it has not been consistent. Yesterday I was seeing all except for firefox throwing this error on every highstate run, and today its only firefox. The only changes that were made in between is that the salt-master was upgraded from 3000.1 to 3000.2 and some changes to entirely unrelated functions in a different sls file.

**Setup**
Here are my current  function definitions for the mentioned packages:
```
#common.sls
chocolatey:
  pkg.installed

sublimetext3:
  chocolatey.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: chocolatey

firefox:
  chocolatey.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: chocolatey

#webserver.sls
dotnet4.7.2:
  chocolatey.installed

#dbserver.sls
sql-server-2019:
  chocolatey.installed:
    - package_args: "/SAPWD:{{pillar['mssql.password']}} /TCPENABLED:1 /NPENABLED:1 /SECURITYMODE:SQL"
```

**Expected behavior**
Function should succeed with no changes reported.

**Additional context**
I notice that my minion version is behind, I've tried using the command `salt minion pkg.latest_version salt-minion` to upgrade, but it appears that it hasn't worked
