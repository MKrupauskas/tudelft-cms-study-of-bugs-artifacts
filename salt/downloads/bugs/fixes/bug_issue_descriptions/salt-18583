I'm trying out current develop @ c3b11c867c98e555017b1ee76893a7e3d652240e

When running salt-call, I see the following error

```
# python bin/salt-call --local state.highstate
Usage: salt-call

salt-call: error: no such option: --local
```

And it hangs forever. When running help, it shows --local as an valid option.
