### Description of Issue/Question
salt-2017.7.4
```
I write a state file include file, service , cmd like below:
x.json:
  file.managed:
    - source: 
    ...

service_a:
  service.running:
    - name: xxx
    - enable: True
    - reload: True
    - watch:
      - file: x.json

some_cmd:
  cmd.script:
    - name: salt://xxx.sh
```
service should be reload or restart before cmd, but I found cmd always block service, service will run after cmd finished, is this a issue ?
