I am seeing the below error in my master log file:

2015-11-19 04:12:22,184 [salt.transport.zeromq][ERROR   ][32169] Bad load from minion

The error only happens when the below minion connects. It may be related to the different versions of some of the software (not salt though) on the minion versus the master, for example the tornado version differs.

Also I filed #29029 since I inferred the connection based on stopping/starting the minion, but it would be nice if the IP was logged.
