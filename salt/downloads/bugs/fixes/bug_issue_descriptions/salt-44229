### Description of Issue/Question
cc: @flavio who wrote this function initially. I'll have a PR shortly with unit tests to fix this.

### Setup
I setup a [test kubernetes cluster using minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) and configured `/etc/salt/minion` with the bare defaults but changed `master` to localhost and added:

```yaml
kubernetes.api_url: 'https://192.168.99.100:8443'
kubernetes.certificate-authority-file: '/home/jeff/.minikube/ca.crt'
kubernetes.client-certificate-file: '/home/jeff/.minikube/client.crt'
kubernetes.client-key-file: '/home/jeff/.minikube/client.key'
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```bash
(ve) [root@omniscience salt]# salt-call kubernetes.node_labels minikube
[WARNING ] /home/jeff/git/salt/salt/utils/__init__.py:794: DeprecationWarning: Use of 'salt.utils.fopen' detected. This function has been moved to 'salt.utils.files.fopen' as of Salt Oxygen. This warning will be removed in Salt Neon.
