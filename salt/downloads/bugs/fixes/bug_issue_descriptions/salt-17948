I would expect this command to list the same programs as listed under Programs and Features under Control Panel, but am only getting a subset.

Terracopy from https://codesector.com/downloads is an example of a program which shows up under the list of software you can uninstall via the Control Panel, but which does not shop up when running salt-call --local  pkg.list_pkgs.

7-Zip from http://hivelocity.dl.sourceforge.net/project/sevenzip/7-Zip/9.20/7z920-x64.msi is an example of a program which correctly shows up both places.

This is an issue because  pkg.installed can't detect that the software is installed and will reinstall it for every run.
