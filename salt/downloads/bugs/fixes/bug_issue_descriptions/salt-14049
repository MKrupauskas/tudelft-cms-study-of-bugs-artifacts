I've configured Salt multi-master setup according to documentation http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster.html and noticed that salt calls are being executed several times slower with multiple masters than with single master.

Example with 3 masters executes ~2.3s:

```
[root@node1 ~]# time salt \* test.ping
node1:
    True
node2:
    True
node3:
    True
node4:
    True

real    0m2.279s
user    0m0.273s
sys 0m0.033s
```

Example with 1 master executes ~0.3s:

```
[root@node1 ~]# time salt \* test.ping
node1:
    True
node2:
    True
node3:
    True
node4:
    True

real    0m0.361s
user    0m0.294s
sys 0m0.028s
```

This is not big deal if we need to execute single salt call, but if there are a lot of calls to be performed execution time could be very long.
