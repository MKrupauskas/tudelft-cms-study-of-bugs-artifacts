### Description of Issue/Question

When starting the minion with the standard config, it gives this warning in the log:

`... [salt.cli.daemons ][WARNING ][<pid>] IMPORTANT: Do not use md5 hashing algorithm! Please set "hash_type" to SHA256 in Salt Minion config!`

This is in contrast to a comment in the config, which gives the impression that sha256 is the default. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/conf/minion#L480: `... The default is sha256, sha224, sha384 and sha512 are also supported.`
### Setup

Simply install the latest salt-minion and start it.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

### Versions Report
