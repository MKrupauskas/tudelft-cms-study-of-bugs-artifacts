### Description of Issue/Question
When a new pillar is assigned to a minion and I try to target that minion by the pillar (salt -I '<pillar-name>') it can't execute any command (e.g. state.highstate, test.ping, state.sls). As described in the documentation (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/pillar.html => Note section) after a highstate the salt-master recognizes the new pillar and shows up the minion id, but no commands can be executed.


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Add new pillar to minion (e.g. test_pillar: 1234)
2. Execute highstate for that minion (e.g. salt 'myserver' state.highstate)
3. Call a highstate by targeting that minion on its pillar (salt -I 'test:pillar:1234' test.ping) and the output will look like this:
```
myserver:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```
4. After a minion restart it works
