Since this commit [1] if I run a salt command and specify a returner (e.g. salt '*' test.ping --return postgres) my returner fails on the minion side with a log message:

```
[salt.minion      ][ERROR   ] The return failed for job 20140508114218848521 'config.option'
```

This seems to affect all returners in salt/returners. If I go back to any revision before [1] the problem goes away. Also if I check out the latest version and comment the code of [1] out, the problem goes away.

Unfortunately, I'm still trying to understand the reason for [1] and how it is breaking returners.

Please advise
