**Description**
When running desired state often I am getting the a python traceback when accessing a key in python's structure.
This is happening for refreshing the pillar as well.

**Setup**
~2000 minions running 3001.7
~10 minions running 3003.1
salt-master running 3003.2

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
When running:
[root@3ca4653827b2 /]# salt --async -t 30 -b 30 '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar

I'm getting often this output:
```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: 'ret'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('salt==3003.2', 'console_scripts', 'salt')()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 539, in salt_main
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/salt.py", line 61, in run
    self._run_batch()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/salt.py", line 299, in _run_batch
    for res in batch.run():
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/batch.py", line 298, in run
    ret[minion] = data["ret"]
KeyError: 'ret'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('salt==3003.2', 'console_scripts', 'salt')()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 539, in salt_main
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/salt.py", line 61, in run
    self._run_batch()
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/salt.py", line 299, in _run_batch
    for res in batch.run():
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cli/batch.py", line 298, in run
    ret[minion] = data["ret"]
KeyError: 'ret'
```
**Expected behavior**
I would expect that the salt command could finish successfully and without python's traceback (error).

**Screenshots**
Pasted log should be enough.
