When running a system.reboot usually the minions will return a success state. On CentOS7 however they don't (get to) respond

```
[root@salt1.vm.ca1 pillar]# salt 'srv*.hw.onpremtest.ca1' system.reboot
srv4.hw.onpremtest.ca1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
srv1.hw.onpremtest.ca1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
srv3.hw.onpremtest.ca1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
srv5.hw.onpremtest.ca1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
srv2.hw.onpremtest.ca1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```
