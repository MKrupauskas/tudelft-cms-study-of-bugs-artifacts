Setting ```aggregate: True``` (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/aggregate.html) for ```pkg``` can significantly reduce run time.  However, any requisites attached to pkg states seem to be lost.

**Package Repositories:** If, for example, a package requires a repository to be installed first, the package install can fail because it can get moved ahead of the repository install.  Neither setting the package install to ```require``` the repository install, nor setting the repository install to ```require_in``` the package install seems to help.  A workaround that does appear to succeed is setting ```order: 1``` on the repository install.

**Services:** Another example of an issue is when a package install requires a service restart.  The service won't get restarted because any requisite ties between the package install and the service are lost when ```aggregate``` is used.

This is related to #21312, which has been marked as stale, but the issue appears to persist.
