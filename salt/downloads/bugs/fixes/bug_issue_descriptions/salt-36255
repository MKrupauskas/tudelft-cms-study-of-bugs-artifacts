### Description of Issue/Question

If I have a link that is a redirect to the latest version of a package, salt will not follow the 302 FOUND to determine the name of the package, thereby downloading the package under a name that may not be suitable to install as yum only accepts packages ending by ".rpm"

Would it be possible to either follow the link and get the name of the package from the link or be able to specify a download link ?
### Setup

Using a state like :

```
install plex server:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - plex: "https://plex.tv/downloads/latest/1?channel=16&build=linux-ubuntu-x86_64&distro=redhat"
```

on a centos minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

run the state on a centos 6 or 7 minion and you will get :

"No package /var/cache/salt/[...]/latest/1" available

This should follow the link and resolve to the latest version of a .rpm package
