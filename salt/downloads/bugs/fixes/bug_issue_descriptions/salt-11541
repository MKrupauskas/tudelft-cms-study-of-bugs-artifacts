I just put this in a pillar file on the master:

``` jinja
{% if grains['os'] == 'Debian' %}
myos: debian
{% else %}
myos: somethingelse
{% endif %}
```

and now I get these inconsistent responses:

``` bash
$ salt foo\* pillar.get myos
foo.datamarket.net:

$ salt foo\* pillar.item myos
foo.datamarket.net:
    ----------
    myos:
        debian
```

So, does `pillar.get` resolve only the pillar data that's already applied on the minion, while `pillar.item` resolves the pillar data that _would_ be sent to the minion if an operation were run on it? Or what?

The documentation is unclear about both; for `pillar.get` it says “Attempt to retrieve the named value from pillar” and for `pillar.item` it says “Return one ore more pillar entries”. This does not explain the above difference. This should be clearer.
