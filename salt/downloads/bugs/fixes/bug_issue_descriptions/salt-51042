### Description of Issue/Question

If minimum two pkg states (e.g. purged, or installed) are executed before the `zfs.filesystem_present` state, then an exception will be thrown.

### Setup
init.sls file
```
pkgs_deinstalled:
  pkg.purged:
      - name: nonexistend

pkgs_deinstalled2:
  pkg.installed:
      - name: nonexistend

user_home_test:
  zfs.filesystem_present:
    - name: zroot/home/test
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the init.sls file above and you'll get an exception like this:
```
----------
          ID: user_home_test
    Function: zfs.filesystem_present
        Name: zroot/home/test
      Result: False

The weird thing is that this exception is only thrown if the order is like above (1st pkg state, 2nd pkg state and 3rd zfs.filesystem_present) and it doesn't matter if it's a pkg.purged or pkg.installed state. If I change the order like 1st pkg.purged, 2nd zfs.filesystem_present and 3rd pkg.installed, then it works.

I was not able to figure out where this dict (self._dict() in context.py class) gets overwritten and why it only gets overwritten if there are two pkg states first.


The same state works on FreeBSD 10 with salt-minion 2017.7.3
