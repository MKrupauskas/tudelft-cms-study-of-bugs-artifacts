This may be a bug in my understanding, but I'm having troubles with packages paths for winrepo packages attached via win_gitrepos.  Here is what we have in /etc/salt/master:

```
win_gitrepos:
  - https://readonly:user:pass@github.ourdomian.com/path/winrepo.git
```

From inside the winrepo gitfs top-level directory, we have only directories:

```
$ls
firefox  notepad++  putty etc
```

From inside any of the subdirs, we have a layout like this:

```
$ls putty
init.sls  putty-0.63-installer.exe
```

```
$cat putty/init.sls
putty:
  0.63:
    installer: 'salt://winrepo/putty/putty-0.63-installer.exe'
    full_name: 'PuTTY version 0.63'
    locale: en_US
    reboot: False
    install_flags: '/sp- /verysilent'
```

My confusion is around the salt:// path that should be used inside the init.sls files.  Where is win_gitrepos "mounted" by the salt master such that I can reference windows package files via a salt:// style URL ?   Or is storing the package files themselves in win_gitrepos not allowed or intended to work?
