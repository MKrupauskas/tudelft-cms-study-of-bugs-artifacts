**Background:** My `top.sls` file has the following:

``` yaml
prod:
    # ...
    'queue-* and S@{{ MYCIDRÂ }}':
        - my.pillar

    # ...
```

I've had it in production for a while and it seems to match the minions. I am able to run `salt 'mypillar*' pillar.get my:pillar` so it is clearly defined.

**Problem/surprise:** I haven't added any `match: compound` clause to it.

**Expected:** That the target doesn't match anything since it's supposed to use `glob` targetting by default.

**What happens:** It matches a minion as if I've defined `match: compound`.
