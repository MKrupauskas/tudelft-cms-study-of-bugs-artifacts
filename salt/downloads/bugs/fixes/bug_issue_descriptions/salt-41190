### Description of Issue/Question

When using the archive.extracted state to extract a 10GB .tar.xz file, I get this error: "xz: (stdout): Write error: No space left on device".

I investigated the situation and found that in salt/modules/archive.py, in the _list_tar function, a temporary file is generated with tempfile.mkstemp and the compressed archive is then decompressed to that location. If the size of the decompressed .tar file exceeds the size of the /tmp filesystem, xz terminates with the error above.

I'm wondering why a temp file is written at all and xz output is not simply piped to tar.
