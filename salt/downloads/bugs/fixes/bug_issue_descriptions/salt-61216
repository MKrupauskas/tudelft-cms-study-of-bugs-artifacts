Hi,

This is the first time I tried salt + first time I looked at some python code, fix may not be appropriate nor written correctly

**Description**
The --list-images option / avail_images() on the proxmox driver does not honor cluster node states
See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61215

The --list-images option / avail_images() on the proxmox driver does not support any location parameter

**Current behavior**

```
$ salt-cloud -f avail_images pveProvider location=foo
[ERROR   ] There was an error running the function: avail_images() got an unexpected keyword argument 'kwargs'
```

Quick&ugly fix to get around the default location was to add 
```
def avail_images(call=None, location="local", kwargs=None):

    if call == "action":
        raise SaltCloudSystemExit(
            "The avail_images function must be called with "
            "-f or --function, or with the --list-images option"
        )

    # Ideally if we'd just reuse the already present location var(probably there is a standard way to do that), this is rather ugly
    if (kwargs is not None) and (kwargs['location'] is not None):
        location = kwargs['location']

    ret = {}
    for host_name, host_details in avail_locations().items():
        for item in query(
            "get", "nodes/{}/storage/{}/content".format(host_name, location)
        ):
            ret[item["volid"]] = item
    return ret
```
