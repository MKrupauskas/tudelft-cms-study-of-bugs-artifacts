Hey all,
After adding the `repo.saltstack.com` to my sources list I'm trying to install the `salt-minion` on my Linux 16.04 server.

While installing I'm getting an HashSum mismatch on package [python3-distro_1.0.1-2_all.deb](http://repo.saltstack.com/py3/ubuntu/16.04/amd64/latest/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/).

I test the hash of the package `python3-distro_1.0.1-2_all.deb` and compare it to the one written at the [Release](http://repo.saltstack.com/py3/ubuntu/16.04/amd64/latest/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/Release) file and they are different.

Please advice.
How this issue can be resolved?
Can you fix the (http://repo.saltstack.com/py3/ubuntu/16.04/amd64/latest/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/Release) file at the repo?
