I had a pillar with a hyphen in the name that would fail to resolve in a state. 

```
#!jinja|yaml|gpg
example-app:
  data_1: |
[PGP message]
  data_2: |
[PGP message]
```

In the salt state they would be retrieved as: 

```
{% set data_1 = salt['pillar.get']('example-app:data_1') -%}
{% set data_2 = salt['pillar.get']('example-app:data_2') -%}
```

After running the states, I would find that no data would be returned and the two variables would be `None`. I tried using the `pillar` dictionary as well and it would say there is no element named `example-app`. It is odd because doing `salt target pillar.get example-app:data_1` would return the data correctly. Eventually I went and just changed the hyphen to an underscore and it fixed the problem. I'm not sure if I missed something, but I did not see any documentation suggesting that hyphens are not allowed. It seems like a bug.
