### Description of Issue/Question
This is primarily a question, and I'll defer to the salt developers' collective judgment on whether it's an issue or not.

What I want to do is run `salt '*' state.sls XXXX mock=True` for every single sls file I have. In almost all cases, this does exactly what I want -- it catches Jinja syntax errors, it catches malformed sls files, missing requisites, etc. (which is _excellent_, thank you for this feature!)

However, in cases where the state function's `__virtual__` function returns `False`, the entire mock returns `Result: False` and is reported as a failure. For example:
```
          ID: postgres_database
    Function: postgres_database.present
        Name: mydb
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'postgres_database.present' was not found in SLS 'postgres'
              Reason: 'postgres_database' __virtual__ returned False: Unable to load postgres module.  Make sure `postgres.bins_dir` is set.
     Changes:
```

I have observed this with:
`mysql_user`
`mysql_database`
`postgres_initdb`
`postgres_user`
`postgres_database`
`dockerng`
`git`
(there might be others that I haven't specifically observed).

Is this the expected behavior? I can see arguments for both yes and no.


### Setup
Here is an sls file that will reproduce the issue (let's call it `test_state.sls`):
```
postgres_database:
  postgres_database.present:
    - name: mydb
    - db_user: someuser
    - db_password: excellentpw
```
I am using a basic two-node setup in Vagrant with a VirtualBox provider (one master talking to one minion)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On the master, I run this command:
`salt '*' state.sls test_state mock=True`
