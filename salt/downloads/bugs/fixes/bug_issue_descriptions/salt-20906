It seems that the problem exists here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/linux_acl.py#L222
The command that is created fails, because -m option needs acl_spec as argument.
When using recurse command created is:

```
setfacl -m -R u:username:rwx directory
```

Correct command should be:

```
setfacl -R -m u:username:rwx directory
```
