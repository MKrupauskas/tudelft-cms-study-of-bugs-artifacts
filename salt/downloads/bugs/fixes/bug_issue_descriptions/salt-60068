**Description**
Slack has deprecated the possibility to pass API tokens in the url string. See https://api.slack.com/changelog/2020-11-no-more-tokens-in-querystrings-for-newly-created-apps

As far as I can tell, all the Slack modules rely on building the url with the API token in it. These modules would need to be rewritten to pass the API token in the Authorization HTTP header as per Slack's requirement.

I encountered this issue today when setting up a new bot app with exactly the same setup as my previous ones.
slack.post_message continually returns

```
minion:
    ----------
    message:
        invalid_auth
    res:
        False
```

The slack modules work fine for any of my bots created before February 24, 2021 because they still support the url string method. But any bots created after February 24, 2021 will run into the issue above.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Set up a Slack bot app and try running slack.post_message with the Bot User OAuth Token as the api_key. This should return invalid_auth even though the API token is valid.

You can verify the validity of your API token by posting a message using Slack's testing tool https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage/test

**Expected behavior**
Should work the same way the slack modules have worked previously
