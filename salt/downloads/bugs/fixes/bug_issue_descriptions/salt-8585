The name of this Windows network interface card has a # sign in it. Shouldn't putting the name in single quotes keep the '#' from being treated as the beginning of a comment? This behavior happens on both Windows and Linux

```
root@boucha:~/salt# salt \* test.echo 'Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter #1'
boucha:
    Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter

root@boucha:~/salt# salt \* test.echo 'Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter \#1'
boucha:
    Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter \#1
```

Just at the cli:

```
root@boucha:~/salt# echo #

root@boucha:~/salt# echo '#'
#
```
