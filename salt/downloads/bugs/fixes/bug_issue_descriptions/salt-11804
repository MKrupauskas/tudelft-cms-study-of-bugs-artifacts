Is there a way we can limit and even omit the jobs folder cache from cache listings as i dont know where jobs caching will be used anyway.

Problem is that on big installs the jobs folder is just ... "huge" and the filelisting caching which happens a lot just make every salt call a candidate to reissue the caching, and this make the command last some minutes instead of a second ...

The workaround i found for the moment is to wipe the jobs folder when it becomes unusable.

So either i am totally wrong in my salt usage or we have a pretty serious bug here.
