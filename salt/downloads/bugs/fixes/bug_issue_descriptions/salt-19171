Salt seems to get hung trying to resolve the master hostname through DNS.  Here is the error received:

[ERROR   ] DNS lookup of 'SaltMaster' failed.
[ERROR   ] Master hostname: 'SaltMaster' not found. Retrying in 30 seconds

I have some minions (e.g. laptop) which need to use a different hostname for the salt-master depending on which network the minion is connected to.  it seems that now that salt can communicate with multiple masters, the minion should not get hung up if one of the master's hostnames cannot be resolved.

Pre 0.16, I could see where the minion would reasonably be expected to become stuck if the master couldn't be resolved.  However, with multiple masters being possible, it's not possible that a master may not resolve while another resolves just fine.  Another scenario might be an organization preparing to migrate to a new salt master, but there may be a transition period where the minions are configured to look for the old master and the new master.  At some point, the old master may be switched off, and thus, would be unresolvable.  However, if another master is available, the minion should still run, but log the error.
