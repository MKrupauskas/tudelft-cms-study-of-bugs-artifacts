### Description of Issue/Question

The first time this state is executed an error level output is logged on the minion.  This has caused some alarm for some of our engineers picking through logs.  I believe this is because an attempt is made to grep the file without first checking that the file exists.  

**Minion Log**
```
[ERROR   ] Command '['grep', 'evertz', '/etc/nginx/.htpasswd']' failed with return code: 2
[ERROR   ] stderr: grep: /etc/nginx/.htpasswd: No such file or directory
[ERROR   ] retcode: 2
```

If someone can confirm this assumption I'll make a PR with a proceeding file exists check.

### Setup

```
htpasswd_file:
  webutil.user_exists:
    - name: bob
    - password: {{ pillar['engineering_webui_password'] }}
    - htpasswd_file: /etc/nginx/.htpasswd
    - force: true
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Execution of the state on a machine where the `/etc/nginx/.htpasswd` has yet to be created.
