Currently, `salt.states.file.replace` changes the ownership of the file that is being updated. I believe this state should honor the original user/group and additionally support the `user` and `group` parameters as most of the other `file` states.

I worked around this issue by using a `file.managed` state later on the process to manage the ownership.
