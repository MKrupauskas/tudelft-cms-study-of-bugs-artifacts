### Description of Issue/Question

when attempting to run the following sls file: 

```
winpkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - chrome
      - firefox
      - adobereader
```

I continue to get the following error: `minion did not return` even when i change the timeout to 1000 (`-t 1000`). It actually installs the packages correctly but I would expect for salt to wait until the packages have been installed before timeing out.
### Setup
1. (1) windows minion and linux master
2. /srv/salt/pkg.sls:

```
winpkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - chrome
      - firefox
      - adobereader
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. `salt 'win*' state.sls windows.pkg -t30`

Then it will return with `minion did not return`. I am expecting it to wait until the packages are installed adn then report back when that has occurred.
