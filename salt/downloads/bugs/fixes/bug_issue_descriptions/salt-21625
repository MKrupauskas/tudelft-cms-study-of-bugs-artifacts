If the returned status code is for example 403, then the response body of the error is compared against source_hash and the state fails with a wrong hash error. Yep, I had "fun" debugging that until I realised that the URL is wrong, many hours after checking all the bits and pieces.

I'd say that 4xx and 5xx status codes should be treated as errors and the state output should properly display that instead of reading an useless response body and throwing a bad hash error which doesn't explain the nature of the failure.
