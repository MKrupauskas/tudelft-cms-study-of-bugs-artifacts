### Description of Issue/Question

reference: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/pip_state.py
In pip_state.py line 44, salt seems to import pip.req.
However, in pip latest version 10.0.0, there is no req module.
```
$ pip --version
pip 10.0.0 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip (python 2.7)
$ python -c "import pip.req" 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named req
```
Most states requiring pip and automatically install the latest pip (10.0.0).
This caused all states which require pip failed. 
I ran into one of them when I tried to run highstate to install docker on my minions.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
In top.sls
```
 'minion':
  - docker
```
I use docker-formula from https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/docker-formula.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
$ salt '*' state.highstate saltenv=base -l debug

```

     Comment: An importable Python 2 pip module is required but could not be found on your system. This usually means that the system's pip package is not installed properly.
