mod### Description of Issue/Question

1. user "foo" gets created
2. A script in the home directory of this user should get executed

Both should be done in one step


```
create_user_foo:
  ...

init_foo:
  cmd.run:
    - name: init_foo
    - creates: ~/var/data
    - runas: foo

```

cmd.run gets always executed because tilde-expansion does not work.

Unfortunately I don't know the location of the home directory before.

AFAIK this does not help: `{{ salt['user.info'](my_user).home }}` since it gets executed too early (before step 1 (user gets created))

I think the only solution is that "creates" of `cmd.run` needs to support tilde-expansion.
