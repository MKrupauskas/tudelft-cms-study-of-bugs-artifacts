The kmod module assumes it's working with /etc/modules to configure kernel module persistence.  This appears to have been deprecated in many modern linux distributions and creates problems when not available.

using salt 0.15.1

For example, from an Arch Linux system (systemd):
    State: - kmod
    Name:      tun
    Function:  present
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1210, in call
    ret = self.states[cdata['full']](*cdata['args'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/kmod.py", line 41, in present
    persist_mods = **salt**['kmod.mod_list'](True)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/kmod.py", line 172, in mod_list
    with open(_get_modules_conf(), 'r') as modules_file:
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/modules'

The appropriate action is to create a file within /etc/modules-load.d/
