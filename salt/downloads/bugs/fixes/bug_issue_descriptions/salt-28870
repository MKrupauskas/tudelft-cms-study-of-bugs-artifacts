From a salt-users thread:

I'm trying to create a raid0. All attempts fail except my home grown cmd.run.

I find two different salt.state.mdadm documents with different examples and each fails in different ways.
The only difference in my state file from the example is I'm specifying raid 0 and my specific devices.

I really want to use provided states instead of rolling my own via a cmd.run. 
Would someone please tell me what's wrong.  I'm following examples in the official docs so I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.
Also why there are two different flavors of the "latest" docs running around.

Here are the "latest" document links, my state file, and the error I get from each example. My version info following them.

    - devices:

    - run: True
```
