In service.running, I'm using - watch: with - file /etc/package. /etc/package is using file.recurse to copy a tree over. When I make a change to one of the files on the salt master and run highstate, the new file is copied in place correctly but the service is not restarted.

Note that using watch: - file /etc/package/\* gives the error "The following requisites were not found".
