Hello folks,

I ran the command " pip install --upgrade salt" to update my salt version from 2014.1.4 and then I got the following error when I try to start the daemon:

 # /etc/init.d/salt-master start
Starting salt-master daemon: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-master", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

    working_set.require(**requires**)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 648, in require
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))

    raise DistributionNotFound(req)

                                                           [FAILED]

Does anybody have the same issue?

Thanks.
