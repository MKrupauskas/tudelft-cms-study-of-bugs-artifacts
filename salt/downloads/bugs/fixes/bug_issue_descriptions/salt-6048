Using cp.get_dir like this works:

```
sudo salt -G 'os:Ubuntu' cp.get_dir salt://wordpress/wordpress/ '/tmp/davetest'
```

But if in the source directory there is a `wordpress` directory as well as a `wordpress-backup` directory, both directories will be copied down to the target directory.

Possible regex not being anchored correctly?
