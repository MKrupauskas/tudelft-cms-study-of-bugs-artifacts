SaltStack seems to conditionally import some state modules only if all their pre-requisites are met. For example, for `pip_state`, the module is  (roughly) made available only if a `pip` command is found on the path. I think this leads to confusing error messages. For example I got the following error message when trying to use pip.installed: "module pip_state not available" (or something like that). I wasted some time figuring out what the problem was. (Filed in #23682.)

I think that in this kind of situation, it would be better to have the state modules always imported but produce an error when their functionality is used. The error message could then be a lot clearer (e.g. "State pip.installed requires either a system pip command available, or use of the bin_env option.") I think failing the import when required stuff is not available is a bit confusing in term of error messages.

(Filing a general bug report about this at the suggestion from @jfindlay.)
