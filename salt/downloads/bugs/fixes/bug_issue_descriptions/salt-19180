Hello, salt-ssh's grains wrapper doesn't implement the "base" keyword argument in filter_by() resulting in salt-ssh specific failures when you have a setup making use of this keyword argument. Compare https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/client/ssh/wrapper/grains.py#L145 and 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/grains.py#L355.

This is the second time that such a mismatch got introduced (the first time for the addition of the "default" keyword, which is still unusable with salt-ssh in the 2014.7 release). Can we have some unittests comparing the signatures of the functions between the wrapped module and the original modules?
