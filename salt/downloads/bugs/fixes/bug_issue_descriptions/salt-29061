I applied a chassis state to my enclosures over the past few days, and while the output suggested it applied the `chassis_name` properly, they're all actually now called "CHASSIS-SETUP".

Here is the state:

```
{% set details  = salt['pillar.get']('proxy:chassis', {}) %}
chassis-setup:
  dellchassis.chassis:
    - chassis_name: {{ details['name'] }}
    - datacenter: {{ details['datacenter'] }}
```

Corresponding pillar data:

```
proxy:
  host: cptbc6en1.ut1.cpt.adobe.net
  chassis:
    name: cptbc6en1.ut1.cpt.adobe.net
    datacenter: UT1
```

Looks like the code for setting the name may have the wrong argument position? In any case, I now have 170 chassis enclosures called "CHASSIS-SETUP"
