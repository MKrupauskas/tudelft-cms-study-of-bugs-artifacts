I'm seeing a lot of this whenever I highstate:

```
          ID: /mnt/shows
    Function: mount.mounted
      Result: True

              umount:
                  Forced remount because options changed
```

Yet the options have not changed. It happens all the time.

My statefile looks like:

```
/mnt/cloudshows:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: gfs001:/rdo
    - fstype: glusterfs
    - mkmnt: True
    - persist: False

/mnt/shows:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: /mnt/cloudshows/rdo/shows
    - fstype: none
    - opts: bind
    - persist: False
    - require:
      - mount: /mnt/cloudshows
```

The first one evaluates correctly and only mounts once, but the second bit with the bind mount will always remount, thinking the options changed. I don't get it. (...and yes I specifically need a bind mount; symlinking is not an option for what I need this for.)

I'm running salt "2014.7.0 (Helium)" on CentOS 6.6.
