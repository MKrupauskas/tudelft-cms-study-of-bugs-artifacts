### Description of Issue/Question

In case if slapd / libldap will encode attribute value as base64 then salt will see is as 'different' value and will try to add it over and over again (which will or will not fail - but either way will lead to bad config).
### Setup

```
       olcSyncRepl:
           - |
             {0}rid=0 provider=ldap://some-master.domain.work
               searchbase="dc=domain,dc=work"
```

Above will produce a base64 encoded value on slapd ldif side (denoted but double semicolon 'olcSyncRepl:: <base64>'
!! Be aware that this encoded base64 can get wrapped to add to complication !!
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Define any attribute as above and run salt-call few times.
