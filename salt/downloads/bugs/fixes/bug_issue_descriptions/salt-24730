Hi - this regards a PoC I'm trying with SUSE netapi (https://github.com/SUSE/saltstack-netapi-client-java/issues/79). PoC is about extending netapi to cherrypy websocket endpoint.
Here's the issue in short: When I'm connecting to salt-api websocket (endpoint /ws) with a python based client all seems to work fine. That is I can see the TCP packets been sent over the connection (`tcpdump -i any 'port 8000'`) and the python client does get the salt events.

Yet, when I'm trying to mimic the same scenario with a simple javax.websocket based java client I can see the socket connection being set up normally but for some reason events never seem to be sent over. That is I don't even see TCP packets being sent and instead I see a Broken pipe error in salt-api console:

```

Java client code can be found here: https://github.com/winglet/saltstack-netapi-client-java  (a fork of SUSE net-api actually) 
and a prebuilt jar here: https://github.com/winglet/code-garage/blob/master/saltstack-netapi-garage/saltapi.jar (example run: `java8  -jar saltapi.jar http://localhost:8000/  saltuser  saltuser ws://localhost:8000/ws/  "websockets"`)

System details follow:
salt 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
cherrypy.**version** : 3.7.0
ws4py.**version**: 0.3.4
