Hi,

This is possible a bug of release 2014.1. Refers to commit 56f01ea 

The pkg.installed can't find the package properly sometimes. This is due to the **salt**['avail'] cache dict is not reloaded in some situations. In my test case, I have a private yum repository managed. I installed epel repository rpm package from my private repository and managed a new postgresql-9.2 repository. And then I'm trying to install something from the epel and postgresql9.2 repositories, and it failed. Here's my script and the error messages:

```
# This is my private repository.
private-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Private repository
    - baseurl: http://192.168.129.242/megaphone/centos/$releasever/$basearch
    - gpgcheck: 0
    - enabled: 1

# I was trying to install epel repository from my private repository.
epel-repo:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: epel-release
    - require:
      - pkgrepo: private-repo

# Then I installed something.
syslog-ng:
  pkg.installed:
    - refresh: True
    - require:
      - pkg: epel-repo

# Then I added another postgresql9.2 repository.
postgresql92-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: PostgreSQL 9.2 $releasever - $basearch
    - baseurl: http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    - gpgcheck: 0
    - enabled: 1

# Now I want to install postgresql92 server.
postgresql92-server:
  pkg.installed:
    - refresh: True
    - require:
      - pkgrepo: postgresql92-repo
```

There are two failure states:
## ...

```
      ID: syslog-ng
Function: pkg.installed
  Result: False
 Comment: Package 'syslog-ng' not found (possible matches: syslog-ng)
 Changes:
```
## ...

```
      ID: postgresql92-server
Function: pkg.installed
  Result: False
 Comment: Package 'postgresql92-server' not found (possible matches: postgresql92-server)
 Changes:
```

If I run the same script for another time, the failed states will work.

After dive into the code, I found you recently added a global cache dict for available packages `(__salt__['avail'])`, and it was not reloaded correctly in this situation (used the old cache). Currently I just removed the cache dict as a quick work around (removed line 391-393 from yumpkg.py). Please review this issue, thanks a lot.
