Hi,

I think there is something wrong with lxc.edited_conf.
My state looks like this : 

``` yaml
lxc-conf:
  lxc.edited_conf:
    - name: mycontainers
    - lxc_conf:
        - lxc.network.type: veth
        - lxc.network.flags: up
        - lxc.network.link: br0
        - lxc.network.ipv4: 1.1.1.1/28
        - lxc.network.mtu: 4200
```

And when applied

``` python
[ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1533, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/lxc.py", line 132, in edited_conf
    lxc_conf_unset=lxc_conf_unset)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/lxc.py", line 1833, in update_lxc_conf
    row[conf].strip()))
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'strip'
```

I guess Yaml parses an int and the code expects a string. 
An easy trick could be to quote the mtu value but it doesn't seem right :)
