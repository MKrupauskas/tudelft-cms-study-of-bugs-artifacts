I still have this exact same problem as Issue #6201 in salt 0.17.5 on CentOS 6.5

I have this in `/srv/pillar/schedule.sls`

```
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 10

  log-loadavg:
    function: cmd.run
    seconds: 30
    args:
      - 'logger -t salt < /proc/loadavg'
    kwargs:
      stateful: False
      shell: True
```

And in `/srv/pillar/top.sls` I have this:

```
base:
  '*':
    - schedule
    - collectd
    - rsyslog
```

If I run `salt "webnode1" pillar.data` I can see this at the very end:

```
    schedule:
        ----------
        highstate:
            ----------
            function:
                state.highstate
            minutes:
                10
        log-loadavg:
            ----------
            args:
                - logger -t salt < /proc/loadavg
            function:
                cmd.run
            kwargs:
                ----------
                shell:
                    True
                stateful:
                    False
            seconds:
                30
```

I would expect at least to have the load average passed to the logs but it doesn't happen. Of course, if I run manually `logger -t salt < /proc/loadavg` it work fine.

How do I even debug?
