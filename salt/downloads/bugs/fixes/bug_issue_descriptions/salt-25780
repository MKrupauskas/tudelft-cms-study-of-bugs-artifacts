HiI have been use redis as my job cache returner, and I found that if redis is down, then salt-master cannot publish job anymore.

```
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/redis/connection.py", line 436, in connect
    raise ConnectionError(self._error_message(e))
redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting to 192.168.1.10:6379. Connection refused.
```

Is there any config option to enable a backup cache, such as local cache?
Thanks.
