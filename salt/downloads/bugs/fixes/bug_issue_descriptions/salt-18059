When running a state file containing file.manage contents are not getting added. The file, stuff1.txt gets created, however. Using Salt v2014.7.0.

Here is the state file:

```
my_file:
  file.managed:
    - name: c:\temp\stuff1.txt
    - content: 'hello and a few other things world'
```

Here is the command and output:

```
# salt Win state.sls testnodrive
