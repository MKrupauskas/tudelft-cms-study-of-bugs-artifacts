### Description of Issue/Question

Taking an arbitrary state, e.g. [`grains.present`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/ref/states/all/salt.states.grains.html#salt.states.grains.present), and running the state on a proxy minion:

```sls
grain_name:
  grains.present:
    - value: to_be_appended
```

```bash
# salt device1 state.sls grains
device1:
----------
          ID: grain_name
    Function: grains.present
      Result: True
     Comment: Set grain grain_name to to_be_appended
     Started: 21:57:31.580883
    Duration: 35.439 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              grain_name:
                  to_be_appended

Summary for device1
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:  35.439 ms
```

(device1 is a proxy minion)

Although the state was executed successfully, the grain is actually not set:

```bash
# salt device1 grains.get grain_name
device1:
```

However, it is configured under

```bash
# cat /etc/salt/grains
grain_name: to_be_appended
```

I believe this will be waiting for https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/42074 to be sorted beforehand.
