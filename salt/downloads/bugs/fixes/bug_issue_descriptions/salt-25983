I am trying to unzip a local file

``` saltstack
unzip_{{target.name}}:
    archive.extracted:
      - name:  "/projects/{{target.name}}/webapps/ROOT/"
      - source: "/home/jenkins/build/blah.zip
      - archive_format: zip
```

The thing is trying to get a hash:

``` python-traceback
[DEBUG   ] Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/file.py", line 1558, in managed
    follow_symlinks)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/file.py", line 4108, in manage_file
    dl_sum = get_hash(sfn, source_sum['hash_type'])
TypeError: string indices must be integers, not str

[ERROR   ] Unable to manage file: string indices must be integers, not str
[INFO    ] Completed state [/var/cache/salt/minion/files/dev/blah01_webapps_ROOT_.zip] at time 16:13:24.375870
```

Looks related to this code

possible patch, works for me

```
            # If the downloaded file came from a non salt server or localsource                                                                                                               
            # verify that it matches the intended sum value                                                                                                                                   
            if _urlparse(source).scheme not in ( 'salt',''):
```
