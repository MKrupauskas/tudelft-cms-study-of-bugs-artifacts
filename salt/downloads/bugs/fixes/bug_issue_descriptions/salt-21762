I'm not sure what caused it (In Vagrant dev environment), but ultimately my checkout lost its upstream tracking information to origin/master

This caused salt to report:

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'git config branch.master.remote' failed with return code: 1
```

Repairing the upstream with:

```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
```

resolves this issue. I suggest that instead of failing when that command returns non zero, to instead repair the upstreaming tracking information using the branch command supplied.
