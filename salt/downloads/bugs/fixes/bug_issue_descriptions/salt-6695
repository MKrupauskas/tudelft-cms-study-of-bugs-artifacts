noticed a bug in mysql returner. 

For eg: If you do salt * test.ping --return mysql 
The result does not appear in mysql. 

We see the following error in the console.

```
2013-08-09 11:42:22,161 [salt.minion ][ERROR ] The return failed for job 20130809114222072191 object of type 'bool' has no len() 
```

This is caused by line 115 in returners/mysql.py 

The return data is as follows: 

```
{ 
"jid": "20130809114607829213", 
"return": true, 
"retcode": 0, 
"success": true, 
"fun": "test.ping", 
"id": "coordinator1.affirm.com" 
} 
```

The value of 'return' is causing the error, I suppose.
