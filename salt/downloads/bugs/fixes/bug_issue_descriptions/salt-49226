### Description of Issue/Question

After upgrading salt-cloud from 2016.11.6 to 2018.3.2 we've been observing a situation when provider-specific grains have not been applied to the target instance.

### Setup

Excerpt from our initial configuration that was working fine with 2016.11.6:

```
prov1:
  driver: ec2
  minion:
    master: x.x.x.x
  grains:
    prov1_grain1: foo
    prov2_grain2: bar

profile1:
  provider: prov1
  grains:
    env: nonprod
    roles:
      - role1
      - role2
      - role2
```

Target instance launched with 2016.11.6 contained all the grains merged in a proper way, i.e.:

```
prov1_grain1: foo
prov1_grain2: bar
env: nonprod
roles:
- role1
- role2
- role3
```

Target instance launched with 2018.3.2 contained just the grains from profile:

```
env: nonprod
roles:
- role1
- role2
- role3
```

We finally managed to get it working by changing provider configuration to the following:

```
prov1:
  driver: ec2
  minion:
    master: x.x.x.x
    grains:
      prov1_grain1: foo
      prov2_grain2: bar
```

I.e., `grains` tree should be under `minion` now.

However, documentation examples still contain older (legacy?) syntax:

```
# Note: This example is for /etc/salt/cloud.providers or any file in the
# /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/ directory.

my-ec2-southeast-public-ips:
  # Set up the location of the salt master
  #
  minion:
    master: saltmaster.example.com

  # Set up grains information, which will be common for all nodes
  # using this provider
  grains:
    node_type: broker
    release: 1.0.1
```

(from https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/aws.html)

My questions so far:
 - is current behavior correct? (grains should be nested from minion in provider config, but not in profile config),
 - should a documentation be changed accordingly?

Thanks!
