**Description**
salt.modules.win_pkg.list_pkgs does not detect installed package where the registry value UninstallString is missing but NoRemove is set to 1.

It is expected that UninstallString should be missing when NoRemove is set per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/arpnoremove

This will also give problem installing the application as it is never detected as installed.

**Setup**
salt-call pkg.list_pkgs

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Install a software with this behaviour or manually edit the registry to mimic it by removing the UninstallString reg value in Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\"Application" and creating a NoRemove DWORD with value 1

**Expected behavior**
Application should still be detected.
