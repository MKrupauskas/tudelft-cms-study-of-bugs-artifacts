I'm trying to target minions in my pillar top.sls file by IP Cidr, and it seems to not be working.  From the command-line I can successfully use something like:
salt -S '172.16.0.0/21' test.ping
# salt-call test.version

[INFO    ] Loaded configuration file: /etc/salt/minion
local:
    0.14.0

I've tried a number of methods and the only ones I can get to work is a grain_pcre match and a compound match, once again using grain_pcre syntax.

What didn't work:

```
'S@172.16.0.0/21':
  - match: compound
  - ...

'172.16.0.0/21':
  - match: ipcidr
  - ...
```

What did work, but isn't really what you'd want:

```
'P@ipv4:(172.16)':
  - match: compound
  - ...

'ipv4:(172.16)':
  - match: grain_pcre
  - ...
```

I am wondering if the top file is not binding to the matcher correctly here, can you open an issue and we will look into it?
