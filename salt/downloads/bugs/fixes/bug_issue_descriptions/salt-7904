## Problem

salt version: 0.17.0

salt/utils/__init__.py has a defined function 

```
def which(exe=None):
```

this method returns only a path for full name (including extension) (e.g. for unzip.exe but not for unzip)

this is used in salt/modules/archive to determine if a specific command (e.g. unzip) is available. e.g. Even if unzip is available in the path and can be executed, the executable is not detected on windows. Hence, command will not work.
## Reproduce

OS: Windows
Install: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/unzip.htm or git (which includes unix tools into path)

**execute:** salt '*' archive.unzip /path/zipfile.zip

This will not extract the zip file even if unzip is available in path. Message "archive.unzip" is not available. will be printed.
## Expected behavior

which also detects windows executables in the path which have the passed name when ommiting extension
