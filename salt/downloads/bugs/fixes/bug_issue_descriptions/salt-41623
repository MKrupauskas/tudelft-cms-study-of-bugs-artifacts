Hello,

When i try to use `cmd.run` within a state and call it using salt-ssh, the result of cmd.run is the following:
```
{'retcode': 0, '_error': 'Failed to return clean data', 'stderr': "'{'run': 'shell'}.run' is not available.", 'stdout': ''}
```
For example add this inside a state `{% set epoch = salt.cmd.run('date +%s') %}`

Note: I am using cmd.run for other cases which works correctly with a regular minion but not with salt-ssh

the value of `epoch` will be as above .
Is this an issue ? Is there a work around in case i needed `cmd.run` the execution module inside a state ?
