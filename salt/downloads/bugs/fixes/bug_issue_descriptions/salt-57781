*Description*

In grains/core.py, v.3001 importing linux_distribution has been changed from:
```

import warnings
....

try:
    from platform import linux_distribution as _deprecated_linux_distribution

    def linux_distribution(**kwargs):
        with warnings.catch_warnings():
            warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
            return _deprecated_linux_distribution(**kwargs)
   except ImportError:
       from distro import linux_distribution


```
to

```
from distro import linux_distribution
```

which results in os_release returning only the major release here (line 2035):

```
        (osname, osrelease, oscodename) = [
            x.strip('"').strip("'") for x in linux_distribution()
        ]

```
and failing to retrieve the correct osrelease and osrelease_info values:

```
    osrelease:
        7
    osrelease_info:
        - 7

```
This is occurring on Centos 7.4, salt v3001
