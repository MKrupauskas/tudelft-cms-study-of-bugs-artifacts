Hello,

I have the excpetion below while attempting an test.ping the installation as you can see below is with RAET only and is intended to run exclusively on RAET and salt-ssh.
Both the minion and master are running fine and I can not spot something obvious in the debug traces.
The installations of all components has been done from source and I can only install from source.

I have update all componentes to the latest version and after several failing attempts in reinstallations I am now turing to you.
I would much appriciate you can point me in the right direction. Hopefully I missed something trivial.

Apologize for the formatting below but my browser does not support any fancy stuff.
