No logs on master or anywhere in between caught a bad jinja tag in an init.sls yaml file.  The pillar data on the minion got wiped out with no trace.  The error was only present a later jinja error where the non-existent pillar data was referenced.  Let me know if this is new and hard to reproduce and I'll get my data over.

in an init.sls

```
someval:
    - {{ nonexistent }}
```

should be all that's required to wipe minion pillar data on pillar_update
