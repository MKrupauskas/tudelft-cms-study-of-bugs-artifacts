### Description of Issue/Question
I was trying to install desired version of openjdk under Centos and faced that problem. Basically, it caused by `ignore_epoch` flag being used only for checking of already installed packages. Openjdk has non-zero epoch, but that epoch is being stripped in [yumpkg.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7.2/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L1353) and version [fnmatched a few lines below](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7.2/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L1367). But it was matched against version containing epoch.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
# salt-call state.single pkg.installed 'version=*:1.8*'  name=java-1.8.0-openjdk test=False
