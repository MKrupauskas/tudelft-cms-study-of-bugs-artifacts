### Description of Issue/Question

Running "salt-key -F" with raet transport configured causes a traceback:

```
$ sudo salt-key -F
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-key", line 10, in <module>
    salt_key()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 289, in salt_key
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/key.py", line 32, in run
    key.run()

    self.finger_all()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/key.py", line 317, in finger_all
    matches = self.key.finger('*')
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/key.py", line 1332, in finger
    ret[status][key] = self._get_key_finger(path)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/key.py", line 1145, in _get_key_finger
    keydata['pub'],
KeyError: 'pub'
```
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
/etc/salt/master:
 transport: raet
 hash_type: sha256
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I have 2 minions accepted.

I think this is due to how RaetKey._get_key_finger() seems incompatible with the data found in local.key.  self.serial.loads() returns a dictionary with keys "priv" and "sign" (as written by the write_local() method), but the _get_key_finger() method is expecting "pub" and "verify".
