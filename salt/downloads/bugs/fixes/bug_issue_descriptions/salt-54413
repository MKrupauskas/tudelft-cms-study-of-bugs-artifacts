### Description of Issue
Using `hosts.add_host` all the entry in `/etc/hosts` are separated by using 2 tab characters. Checking hosts' man entry:
_Fields of the entry are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters._

This creates issues if a directive like `$include` is used inside the `/etc/hosts` file. By using tabs that directive does not work.

The issue is present even by using the `host.present` state, since makes use of the `hosts.add_host` module.

[Checking the code](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2019.2.0/salt/modules/hosts.py#L300), tab characters are used a separator to rewrite alle the hosts

### Setup
Salt installed on a Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS via bootstrap script. Master and minion on the same machine. Simple module execution is involved.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

- create an entry in `/etc/hosts` and separate "IP_address" and "canonical_hostname" using spaces instead of tabs: `echo "111.111.111.111 a_hostname" >> /etc/hosts`
- `cat -T /etc/hosts | grep a_hostname` to check that a blank char have been inserted
- launch: `salt-call hosts.add_host 222.222.222.222 another_hostname`
- `cat -T /etc/hosts | grep a_hostname` . Blank char is now replaced by 2 tabs characters (Tabs are printed as "^I")
