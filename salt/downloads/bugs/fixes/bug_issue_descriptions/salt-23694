running the mdadm state against minion in order to create a RAID device. While the device is successfully created the state returns the message below when trying to call the saved_config() method from mdadm module. 

``` python
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1142, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/mdadm.py", line 291, in save_config
        vol_d = dict([(line.split()[1], line) for line in scan])
    IndexError: list index out of range
```

I also tried the module directly and once again it works fine when creating a RAID device but fails when trying to save the config. Please advice
