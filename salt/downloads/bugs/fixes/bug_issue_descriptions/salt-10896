Seems that #9341 has broken `pkg.installed` refresh parameter support

---

| state | refresh flag | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pkg.installed | True | **???**No update **???** conflicts with [documentation](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/all/salt.states.pkg.html#salt.states.pkg.installed) |
| pkg.installed | False | No update |
| pkg.installed | None | No update |
| pkg.latest | True | Updates |
| pkg.latest | False | No update |
| pkg.latest | None | Updates |

Now I'm wondering - seems the `refresh: True` parameter is not supported any more for `pkg.installed` state module. 

Is it intended or is it regression issue?
If it's intended - then the documentation should be updated accordingly, plus, I would recommend to remove this parameter all together from installed state. It will only confuse end users, myself included
