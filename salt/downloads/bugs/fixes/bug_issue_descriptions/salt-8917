The salt bootstrap installs a _syspaths module during setup. But the salt-master script allows to use a -c config file option. If such a -config option is used, but salt is not installed with the bootstrap script, the default config is used e.g. /etc/salt because the _syspaths force to read from /etc/salt (hardcoded).

A workarround, not tested yet, could be to set the env var SALT_MASTER_CONFIG which points to the master config.

Effected parts:
salt.api does not load the right config and halite and other auth based parts will fail

I think the bootstrap/setup and config concept should get simplified. It's too complex for such a great python product.
