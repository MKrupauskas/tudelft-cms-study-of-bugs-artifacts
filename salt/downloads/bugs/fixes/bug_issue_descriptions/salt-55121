### Description of Issue
I'm trying to write an orchestration that could be executed in parallel when possible. And even I set `parallel: True` it executed serially.

### Setup
I'm trying to do something like this: https://gist.github.com/Oloremo/f786f71044233e0db423d1d873e6c4ab

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I prepared a script to create salt orch structure: https://gist.github.com/Oloremo/90b600f60c48da051023a33da50ce5f7

cd to your salt file_root. and run the provided script.
Directory `delme` will be created in it and populated with 6 files needed for parallel test.
After you're free to run something like
`salt-run state.orchestrate delme.service_orch -l debug 2>&1 | egrep 'Running state|Completed state'`

**Expected**: serviceB and serviceC to be run in parallel.
**Reality**: All services run serially one after another.

At first, I thought it's because I'm running 2 states on a single minion. But feel free to modify targets from the example above so **serviceB** and **serviceC** will be run on different minions - and the results will be the same.
