I've a weird issue on Windows right now. Only on some specific machines. When doing a package installation, the package download seems to block in the middle of the download operation and salt waits for the download to complete indefinitely. In the cache folder, the file is present but partially... ~100Ko instead of 3Mo.
When restarting the service and deleting the file, I have the same comportment. But some time it finally download completly. This pattern can be reproduce on multiple machine and some machine does not have this issue.
I'm running on Windows Xp and downloading the package through HTTP.
I don't have any problem with my Apache server. Everything works fine for linux.
Do you know if there's a bug with python-requests?
