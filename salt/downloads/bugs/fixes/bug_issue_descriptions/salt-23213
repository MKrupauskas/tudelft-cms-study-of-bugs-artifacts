I saw @nmadhok is working on a VMware driver for Salt-cloud (to replace the vsphere one?). 
Pretty cool! We're using the stable version of Salt-{master|minion} but it appears I can just simply add in the `vmware.py` from develop to the correct folder and it seems to work fine. :)

Querying information works great, and after creating a Template VM and a `cloud.profile` for my VM I issued the command to spin it up:

```
salt-cloud -p vmware-ubuntu14.04 testvm.example.com
```

vSphere shows an active cloning task which around >90% completionfailed with an error about it not having a hostname:

```
A specified parameter was not correct. spec.identity.hostName
```

The VM was created though and had the correct name in the VM-tree.
Salt-cloud displayed an error and did not proceed with the provisioning:

```
[ERROR   ] Error creating testvm.example.com: (vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument) {
   dynamicType = <unset>,
   dynamicProperty = (vmodl.DynamicProperty) [],
   msg = 'A specified parameter was not correct. \nspec.identity.hostName',
   faultCause = <unset>,
   faultMessage = (vmodl.LocalizableMessage) [],
   invalidProperty = u'spec.identity.hostName'
}
Error: There was a profile error: Failed to deploy VM
```
