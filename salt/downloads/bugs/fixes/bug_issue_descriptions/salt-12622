This is in continuation of my previous query where i was adviced to upgrade the salt-minion.  but the issue is still prevalent.
master(on centOS) -2014.1.0
minion ( on windows)-2014.1.3.1

I want to sync conf folder in c:/edisea/TDM_HOME/conf from saltmaster

```
sync-conf:
  file.recurse:
    - name: {{ pillar['tdmhome'] }}\conf
    - dir_mode: 777
    - source:  salt://{{  pillar['distroot'] }}conf
 #   - makedirs: True
    - exclude_pat: TdmConfig.groovy
```

However i am getting the following errors

Unable to manage file: global name '**salt**' is not defined
#### c:/edisea/TDM_HOME\conf\Artifacts\Guidelines\Common\EGCDHCF.ecs #### Unable to manage file: global name '**salt**' is not defined
#### c:/edisea/TDM_HOME\conf\Artifacts\Guidelines\Common\EEHCF.ecs #### Unable to manage file: global name '**salt**' is not defined

My project is stuck because of this.Pls help urgently

Thanks in advance
