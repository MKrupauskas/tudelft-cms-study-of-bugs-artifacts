Hello, I wasn't able to find another post about this, so i apologize if there is one and i missed it..

Lately, the output of the salt-call command on the minion looks something like this (Colourless):

```
service_|-freepbx_service_|-freepbx_|-running:
            ----------
            __run_num__:
                34
            changes:
                ----------
            comment:
                Service freepbx is already enabled, and is running
            name:
                freepbx
            result:
                True
```

Before, it used to look similar to what the Master outputs (Colourless):

```
----------
    State: - service
    Name:      freepbx
    Function:  running
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Service freepbx is already enabled, and is running
        Changes:
```

I find that the output is not that clear, long and the colours are barely readable on a white terminal background.

So, Is there an option that allow's me to get the "old" output?
If not, could I ask why it was changed like this?

Lastly, if I must keep this output, Is there a way to make it more readable like the default output I get on the Master? (Green means good, Teal means it changed and Red means an ERROR)

Thanks,
Marc
