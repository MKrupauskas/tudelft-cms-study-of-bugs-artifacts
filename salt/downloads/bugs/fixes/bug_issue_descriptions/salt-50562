### Description of Issue/Question
A scheduled job that runs state.highstate ignores blackout mode. I'm 99% sure this is a change since upgrading from 2018.3.2

### Setup
```
$ salt 'parrot*' schedule.add test_blacko function='state.highstate' seconds=20
parrot.ripe.net:
    ----------
    comment:
        Added job: test_blacko to schedule.
    result:
        True
$ salt 'parrot*' grains.setval minion_blackout true
parrot.ripe.net:
    ----------
    minion_blackout:
        True
```
Wait for highstate...
```
$ salt 'parrot*' grains.item minion_blackout

parrot.ripe.net:
    ----------
    minion_blackout:
        False
```

p.s. In this case the blackout grain is being unset by my something in the highstate, this is expected behaviour because the in highstate I have a stanza like this:
```
salt-minion-blackout:
  grains.present:
    - name: minion_blackout
    - value: false
```
 Of course the issue is that the highstate should not be running in the first place...
