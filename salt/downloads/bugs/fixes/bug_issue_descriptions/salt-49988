### Description of Issue/Question
Currently whenever a log uses cp.get_url or most other https actions that could result in a http error. that error is logged with the URL. However that url could contain the username and password information for a basic authentication scheme. 

Since central logging could be in use it is difficult to control who has access to those logs. 

So password masking would be of great help with url logging. 

### Setup
Simplest test is to use file.managed. and a downed http server. But really any kind of logging that has a URL in it will do this two examples follow

```
2018-09-27 21:01:39,124 [salt.state       :310 ][ERROR   ][7841] Unable to verify upstream hash of source file http://test:test@localhost:80/index.jinja, please set source_hash or set skip_verify to True
2018-09-27 21:02:55,370 [salt.state       :310 ][ERROR   ][7972] Failed to cache http://test:test@localhost:80/index.jinja: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

Ideally something like the following would be better

```
2018-09-27 21:02:55,370 [salt.state       :310 ][ERROR   ][7972] Failed to cache http://test:xxxx@localhost:80/index.jinja: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```
