There is a bug in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/31494997653a46cff63aca0f76d82f1c1f6ffeaf/salt/modules/virt.py#L470 (`modules.virt._disk_profile` and `modules.virt._nic_profile`) in which a custom profile, other than the "default", will not inherit the defaults. In the code the defaults are called `overlay`.

The failing condition can be triggered with the test at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/31494997653a46cff63aca0f76d82f1c1f6ffeaf/tests/unit/modules/virt_test.py#L126-L127.
