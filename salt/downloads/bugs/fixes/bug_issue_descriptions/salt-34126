### Description of Issue/Question

The current docs have a hole in them regarding the configuration of the gnu-agent in order to be able to use a passphrase on the private keyfile which is the recommended approach here:

http://intothesaltmine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/secret-storage/architecture.html

Pertinent line:

```
Youâ€™ll need to manually launch the gpg-agent and then tell SaltStack where it can find the running agent. This
```

Basically I'm following this guide directly and whilst I can get the salt-master to decrypt the details in the pillar (as it obviously has access to the key locally), this won't work on the minion when executing `salt-call pillar.item secret` - in this case all I get is the encrypted information.
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

It's all per directions - the only step I'm missing is how to get the agent to fire up on the request from the minion to unlock the file in order for the master to send the decrypted content.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Follow set up directions from official docs: http://intothesaltmine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapters/secret-storage/introduction.html
### Versions Report

(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
