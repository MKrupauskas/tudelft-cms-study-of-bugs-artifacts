### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

I have a simple state file called resolvconf.sls with the following contents:

```
resolvconf:
  pkg:
    - installed

/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base:
  file.append:
    - text: search {{ salt['cmd.run'](cmd='/bin/dnsdomainname', python_shell=False) }}
    - require:
      - pkg: resolvconf
```

That should not produce any warnings, and yet I get the following each time the state is executed:

`[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/templates.py:73: DeprecationWarning: Starting in 2015.5, cmd.run uses python_shell=False by default, which doesn't support shellisms (pipes, env variables, etc). cmd.run is currently aliased to cmd.shell to prevent breakage. Please switch to cmd.shell or set python_shell=True to avoid breakage in the future, when this aliasing is removed.`

I should not receive a warning because I have explicitly set the value of python_shell, and I am not using any shellisms in my command.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Just run the above state file and watch the warnings appear.

This is on an upgraded minion, but the warning is still there. BTW, this happens a lot - the git tagged release does not report the correct version. Really, the tagged commit should be the one where the version is bumped. I believe that's what's normally done, and it would make things less confusing.
