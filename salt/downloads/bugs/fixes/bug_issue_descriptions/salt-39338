### Description of Issue/Question
After some debugging today, I am 100% sure what's still making my deploy slow
(...after fixing lots of other things like loader, slow formulas rendering time etc.)
The time is wasted in fileclient.py:get_file.
Lots of it.

Basically what I added as a workaround for debugging is that at get_file, I return the file if it exists in the cache without checking if it's up-to-date or using hash_and_stat_file.

get_file is used mostly for retrieving the .sls files, but also for files used in file.managed - the .sls part is much bigger slowdown here

The master-side functions are executing in a fraction of a second(in the master log file), so they are not the problem in my opinion.
(_file_hash etc.)

At this point I think zeromq polling or connection caching could be to blame, but I am going to investigate further - if anyone on the core team would have an idea already, that would be great!
The next thing I am going to check is hash_and_stat, but the files are just small formula files that aren't expensive to hash locally.

Other ideas:
1. Add a master function that returns a map of file<->hash.
This would eliminate the need to call master for each requested file.

Without workaround(+ one sample file.managed task from the output, but there are around 80 states run):

```

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Typical minion-master setup.
Latency between minion and master is 10ms ping.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
2016.11.1, python3
