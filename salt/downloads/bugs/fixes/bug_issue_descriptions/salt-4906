On our Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 master we see huge system loads when restarting salt-master. The watchdog kernel threads go nuts and loads shoots up to 60. It takes about a minute for things to settle down eventually...

This is a server with a 6-core Opteron processor and 16GB of memory that typically has a load under 1 and a third of the memory available for buffers and cache. Although load shoots up fairly high during the salt-master restart, I/O usage doesn't seem to be an issue, so I think the storage is irrelevant. Also, memory usage looks normal during the restart of the salt-master service. 

With top I see CPU time consumed mostly by _us_ and _sy_ processes, with the latter being predominant. They are mostly watchdog and kworker threads. On the user side, I see concurrent _lspci_ processes unexpectedly topping the load chart. Maybe it's worth noting that a single lspci takes quite some time to run on this system:

salt@boiu:~$ time lspci &>/dev/null

real    0m3.394s
user    0m0.072s
sys 0m0.216s

Thanks!
