when developing on another branch I saw some errors that pylint indeed partly confirmed:

```shell
$ pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc salt/modules/groupadd.py
...
E: 55, 8: Instance of 'str' has no 'extend' member (no-member)
E: 75, 8: Instance of 'tuple' has no 'extend' member (no-member)
E:146, 8: Instance of 'tuple' has no 'extend' member (no-member)
E:179,12: Instance of 'tuple' has no 'extend' member (no-member)
E:183,12: Instance of 'tuple' has no 'extend' member (no-member)
...
```
This probably could get a better coverage in tests, I'll try to track it down and then fix it !
