Verified with help of @UtahDave on IRC.

Every file copy operation seems to cause whole fileserver tree to be re-read on master, even if you're only transferring an empty directory (e.g. "Caching directory '_renderers/' for environment 'base'" when _renderers is empty) or a single file.

I had many thousands of files in there (old versions of installed codebases etc.) and state.highstate was taking many, many minutes. Sometimes hours, for multiple servers. By pruning it down to a fraction of that size I sped this up massively.

If possible, can this be changed so that only the _relevant_ directories are read each time?

Sorry if this has already been fixed (waiting for 0.17 rpm to hit epel...).
