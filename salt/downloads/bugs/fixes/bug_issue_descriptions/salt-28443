salt.states.user.present will create accounts with a password hash of "None" if password: is present, but undefined.  Proper behavior is probably to check for null values, and set the password hash to "!" if password is null.  Using "None" instead of "!" means that password expirations will be in place (because "None" isn't considered to be a special hash, like "!"), eventually locking out users that have no password, but are due to rotate it.

Users will frequently have a hash of "!" if other authentication is used instead of local password hashes, such as ssh keys.

This appears to exist in 2015.5.3 and 2015.8.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.  Other platforms have not been tested.
