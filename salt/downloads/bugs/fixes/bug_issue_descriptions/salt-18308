Sometimes I'll get **Error: There was a profile error: Failed to authenticate against remote windows host** errors:

<pre>
    root@ip-172-31-42-67:/srv/salt# salt-cloud -p win2008-splunk-indexer cchung-win-idx

    Error: There was a profile error: Failed to authenticate against remote windows host
</pre>

It's raised by **wait_for_instance**  (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py#L1789), and because there is no retry mechanism in **validate_windows_cred** (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/utils/cloud.py#L689).

so there will be couple seconds (longer for the smaller machine) that the windows machine is ready, but the windows service isnt ready for accepting connections yet (1 & 0 are return codes from winexe command.):

<pre>
    ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED
    1
    ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED
    1
    ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED
    1
    ERROR: Failed to open connection - NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_RESET
    1
    WIN-97SVH1E1AAJ
    0
    WIN-97SVH1E1AAJ
    0
</pre>

This causes the **validate_windows_cred** to return false, then the exception is raised. 
Simply add the retry to **validate_windows_cred**  will resolve this issue:

<pre><code>
def validate_windows_cred(host, username='Administrator', password=None, retries=10):
    '''    Check if the windows credentials are valid    '''
    for i in xrange(retries):
        retcode = win_cmd('winexe -U {0}%{1} //{2} "hostname"'.format(
            username, password, host
        ))
        if retcode == 0: break
        time.sleep(1)
    return retcode == 0
</code></pre>

outputs (note there are two lines of winexe commands):
<pre>

Can someone help us to resolve this? It happens sometimes, but it causes our provisioning process unstable. I'll love to do a pull request if everyone is busy, thanks!
