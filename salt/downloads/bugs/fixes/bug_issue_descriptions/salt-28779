Looks like the output is just a simple dump of the text output of the commands, e.g.:

`/opt/local/salt/bin/salt-call --local zpool.list`

``` yaml
local:
    ----------
    pools:
        - NAME      SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
        - archive  21.8T  10.5T  11.2T         -      -    48%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
        - data     1.81T   546G  1.28T         -    13%    29%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
        - zones     111G  40.8G  70.2G         -    53%    36%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
```

`/opt/local/salt/bin/salt-call --local zpool.status zones`

``` yaml
local:
    -   pool: zones
    -  state: ONLINE
    -   scan: scrub repaired 0 in 0h4m with 0 errors on Mon Nov  9 02:04:09 2015
    - config:
    -     NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
    -     zones       ONLINE       0     0     0
    -       mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
    -         c2t0d0  ONLINE       0     0     0
    -         c2t1d0  ONLINE       0     0     0
    - errors: No known data errors
```

`/opt/local/salt/bin/salt-call --local zpool.status` does not work:

``` yaml
local:
    - cannot open '': name must begin with a letter
```

While it is perfectly fine to request info for all zpools!

``` bash
[root@core ~]# zpool status
  pool: zones
 state: ONLINE
status: Some supported features are not enabled on the pool. The pool can
        still be used, but some features are unavailable.
action: Enable all features using 'zpool upgrade'. Once this is done,
        the pool may no longer be accessible by software that does not support
        the features. See zpool-features(5) for details.
  scan: scrub repaired 0 in 0h4m with 0 errors on Mon Nov  9 02:04:09 2015

          mirror-0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            c2t0d0  ONLINE       0     0     0
            c2t1d0  ONLINE       0     0     0

```

Looking at the code the seems looks to be true for salt.modules.zfs but it is not working on SmartOS at the moment, although the zfs command is available.

```
[root@core ~]# /opt/local/salt/bin/salt-call --local zfs.list
[INFO    ] Executing command 'pkg_info -Q LOCALBASE pkgin' in directory '/root'
'zfs' __virtual__ returned False
```
