Somehow batch mode is loading duplicates into self.minions and only the first one is being updated with a return value. This causes the batch to never finish since len(ret) never equals len(self.minions).

I haven't yet investigated to the cause of the duplicate entries, but adding a unique function to pass self.minions through fixes the batch mode regardless of other issues/misconfigurations that may be present.
