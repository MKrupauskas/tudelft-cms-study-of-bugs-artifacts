boto_vpc module uses the `boto.vpc.connect_to_region` method which is only available in boto version 2.8.0 or later. See https://github.com/boto/boto/commit/33ac26b416fbb48a60602542b4ce15dcc7029f12.

Possible solutions:
- Refuse to run if boto version < 2.8.0 is installed.
- Use a different method for creating the boto connection object.
