On a minion, I have this crazy situation that I don't understand. It appears that the salt module named `pip` is working but `pip_state` is not.

```
$ sudo salt-call pip.install docker-py
[INFO    ] Executing command "/usr/bin/pip2 install 'docker-py'" in directory '/home/ubuntu'
local:

    pid:

```

```
$ sudo salt-call state.single pip.installed name=docker-py
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Specified state 'pip.installed' was not found
```

As far as I can tell, `pip` is installed and working enough to pass the import tests at the top of `pip_state.py`:

```
$ which pip
/usr/bin/pip
$ python -m pip.req
$ python -m pip

Usage:   
  /usr/bin/python -m pip <command> [options]
  ...
```

I also checked that pip is installed on the master, and restarted both minion and master daemons multiple times.

I've skimmed the code in `salt/modules/pip.py` and `salt/states/pip_state.py` and I'm none the wiser. Happy to provide more information or dive deeper with some direction. Thanks!
