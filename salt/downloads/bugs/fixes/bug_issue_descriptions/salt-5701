```
pecl_http:
   pecl.installed
```

This particular pecl package asks a bunch of yes/no questions about what it should use (curl, ssl, etc)

Because it asks questions its never able to just finish installing the extension.

```
pecl help install
```

doesn't really help give any options for helping that situation out but maybe the salt authors have an idea on how to deal with this.
