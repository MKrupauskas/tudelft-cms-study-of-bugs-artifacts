Most of my minions have Helium installed and this runs fine, only my Hydrogen minion fails.

```
ln -s /usr/bin/ruby /usr/local/bin/ruby:
  cmd.run:
    - creates: /usr/local/bin/ruby
    - only_if: test -f /usr/bin/ruby && test ! -f /usr/local/bin/ruby
```

Error output:

```

Most of my machines have ruby compiled from source installed at /usr/local/bin but a few have it installed via atp in /usr/bin. I want to be able to call ruby from cron with confidence so I want to at least have a symlink at /usr/local/bin. If you have suggestions on better ways to do this please feel free. I'm new at this.

Thank you very much. Keep up the good work. Salt is rad!
