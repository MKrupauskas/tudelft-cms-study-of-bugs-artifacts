when my pillar has:

```
{% from slspath + '/vars.jinja' import vars with context %}
```

highstate returns

```
salt minion state.highstate
oat-app-1.cs.private.xxxxx.ca:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1017, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)

        whitelist=kwargs.get('whitelist')

      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 387, in sync_all
        ret['modules'] = sync_modules(saltenv, False)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 253, in sync_modules
        ret = _sync('modules', saltenv)

        relpath = os.path.relpath(fn_, local_cache_dir)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 435, in relpath
        raise ValueError("no path specified")
    ValueError: no path specified
```

next call to highstate give:

```
salt minion state.highstate returns:
----------
    State 'service.oat.user' in SLS 'service.oat.user' is not formed as a list
----------
    State 'service.oat.user' in SLS 'service.oat.user' is not formed as a list
...
```

also if i try to run highstate on any other minion i get:

```
[root@salt ~]# salt jira\* state.highstate
jira.math.xxxxxx.ca:
----------
          ID: states
    Function: no.None
      Result: False
     Comment: No states found for this minion
     Started: 
    Duration: 
     Changes:   
```

also:

```
salt minion pillar.raw
  - BAD.. empty
salt minion pillar.items
  - GOOD
```

I then have to `service salt-master restart`
and comment out the jinja import to regain a stable pillar tree.

I think this was working in a different build... im not sure what commit broke it.
