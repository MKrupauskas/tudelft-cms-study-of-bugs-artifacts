The latest upgrade on Ubuntu 12.04 breaks python-mako. To have a working minion/master I had to uninstall python-mako for the time being.

The latest version of python-mako available from the ubuntu repos is 0.5.0-1, 2014.7.5+ds-1precise1 requires 0.7

Description: shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to administer servers in a fast and efficient way. 

 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data
 can also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running systems becomes a reality. 

 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the
 salt state system uses salt state files to define the state a server needs to be in. 

 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt addresses the backbone of cloud and data center
 management. 

 This particular package provides shared libraries that salt-master, salt-minion, and salt-syndic require to function.
