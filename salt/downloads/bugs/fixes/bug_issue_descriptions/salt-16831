Hello,
I am using the salt backup functionality under file.managed and getting the following error:
Unable to manage file: [Error 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'C:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\file_backup\:'

My sls file is as follows:

```
testfile.txt:
  file:
    - name: D:\Program Files\Test\testfile.txt
    - managed
    - source: salt://test-files/test/testfile1.txt
    - backup: minion
```
