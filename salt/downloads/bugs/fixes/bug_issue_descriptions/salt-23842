I've got a problem with git based external pillar in 2015.5.0. I've setup two external pillars, one based on MongoDB, the other one based on git. When looking at pillar items for a given minion ("salt minion pillar.items"), I only get the ones from the MongoDB pillar (and from the masters filesystem), but not the ones from git.

I have the following lines in the master config file:

```
ext_pillar:
  - mongo: {}
  - git: __env__ github:organization/salt-test.git root=pillar
```

and both the filesystem and git repository contain a top.sls with this content:

```
{{ env }}:
  '*':
    - data
```

The master log file contains this line:

```
[ERROR   ][31414] Unable to checkout branch None: 'git checkout origin/None' returned exit status 1: error: pathspec 'origin/None' did not match any file(s) known to git.
```
