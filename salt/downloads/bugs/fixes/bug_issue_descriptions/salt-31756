According to the docs, setting `keep: false` for the archive.extracted state should prevent the downloaded files from being cached. However, it doesn't seem to change the behavior of the state at all. Each update causes the new archive to be cached along with the previous files.
## Example state

``` yaml
s3_archive:
  archive.extracted:
    - source: s3://{{ bucket }}/{{ key_name }}
    - source_hash: sha256={{ hash }}
    - name: {{ dir }}/{{ release_key }}
    - archive_format: tar
    - keep: false
```

With the above state, I have numerous tarballs hanging around in /var/cache/salt/minion/extrn_files/base/<bucket>/<key>/ that have to be manually deleted.
