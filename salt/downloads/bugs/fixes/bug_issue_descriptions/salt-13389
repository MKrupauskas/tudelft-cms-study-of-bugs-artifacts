Hierarchical git branches don't appear to be mapped correctly. For example, it will serve some_dir for the master and develop branches but for the feature/myfeature branch it will return:

```
 ID: /some/path/
    Function: file.recurse
      Result: False
     Comment: The directory 'salt://some_dir' does not exist on the salt fileserver in saltenv 'feature/myfeature'
     Changes:
```
