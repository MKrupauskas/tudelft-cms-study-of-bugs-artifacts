### Description of Issue/Question

The lsb_release python file is buggy, as I reported [here](https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4180): on systems like raspbian, the file /usr/share/distro-info/raspbian.csv does not exists, which produces an error like this one 

```

    except FileNotFoundError:
NameError: global name 'FileNotFoundError' is not defined
```

Indeed, FileNotFoundError is defined in python 3 and not in python 2.7.

The problem is that because of this bug, it's not possible to start the minion... So it may be a good idea not to crash the whole process just because of a file.

Thank you in advance,

TobiasBora.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run on a raspbian (or on a system with the file /usr/share/distro-info/<distro>.csv removed) the command

    salt-minion -l debug

It crashes.
