### Description of Issue/Question

As per the documentation of the win_task module:

> For additional arguments see:
> py:function::edit_task

However, these (**kwargs) are not passed on to edit_task and therefore cant be set when calling create_task.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Call create_task with any argument specified in edit_task as per the documentation of the win_task module.
