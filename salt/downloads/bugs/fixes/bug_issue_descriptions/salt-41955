### Description of Issue/Question

When running any state using the rabbitmq_* modules with rabbitmq-server version 3.6.10 (and maybe higher) the run fales with the following message:
```
Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1564, in call
              **cdata['kwargs'])
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/rabbitmq_user.py", line 158, in present
              if _check_perms_changes(name, perms, runas=runas):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/rabbitmq_user.py", line 49, in _check_perms_changes
              existing_perms = __salt__['rabbitmq.list_user_permissions'](name, runas=runas)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py", line 369, in list_user_permissions
              return _output_to_dict(res)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py", line 94, in _output_to_dict
              key, values = row.split('\t', 1)
          ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack
```
This error is caused by a change of the output of rabbitmqctl.

#### Output comparision

Output before 3.6.10:
```
~# rabbitmqctl list_users
Listing users ...
magento2        []
support@root360.de      [administrator]
tecdivision     [monitoring]
```

Output with 3.6.10:
```
~# rabbitmqctl list_users
Listing users
magento2        []
support@root360.de      [administrator]
tecdivision     [monitoring]
```

#### Result of error analysis
The modules strip the first line of the output only when it starts with 'Listing' and ends with '...', see _safe_output() in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py#L130.
As the '...' are missing in 3.6.10 the first line isn't stripped anymore but processed by _output_to_dict().
Because the line does not contain '\t' the conversion fails and the mentioned error is printed.

### Setup
Example sls:
```
manage_rabbitmq_users:
  rabbitmq_user.present:
    - name: test
    - password: test
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. install rabbitmq-server in version 3.6.10, e.g. from https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/ubuntu/
2. run salt state using the rabbitmq_* modules

### Versions Report
all version up to master of salt as long as rabbitmq-server is 3.6.10 (and maybe higher)
