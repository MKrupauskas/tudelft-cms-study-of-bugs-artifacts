I configured salt-minion to run as a non-root user but run all its commands via a sudo user using the sudo_user property in the minon configuration.

I created the 'my-minion' user, gave it sudo privileges and made sure that no password is required for command execution and configured the minion accordingly.

**/etc/sudoers**

```
# sudo privileges and permission to execute cmds with no password
my-minion ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

**/etc/salt/minion**

```
# The user to run salt.
user: my-minion
sudo_user: root
```

However executing salt '*' state.highstate from the salt master always returns the following error -

```
The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 17121 and was started at 2015, Jul 28 15:58:08.625398 with jid 2015072815580862539
```

There's not anything particularly helpful in the debug logs apart from the fact that the state.highstate module is getting LazyLoaded twice.

The salt version I am using is 2015.5.3 (Lithium) and the operating system is CentOS 6.6

**NOTE:** The error goes away when I simply comment the sudo_user property in the minion config file but obviously I don't get the functionality that I was looking for. 

Here's the output of the `salt --versions-report` command -
