salt-cloud is working fine for my use case in "normal" (sequential) mode. 

When I do the same thing with "-P" only one of the machines in the map gets a floating IP attributed, so the other machines never get to be accessed and the thing runs in a loop (I guess there's a timeout). 

Am using it against an openstack installation.
