### Description of Issue/Question

requirements requisite makes pip.installed run every time state applies, whether pip packages defined in requirements file are installed or not.
### Setup

My airflow state has following formula:

```
celery:
  pip.installed:
    - name: celery == 3.1.18
    - requirements: salt://airflow/etc/requirements.txt
    - require:
      - pkg: py27-pip
```

`airflow/etc/requirements.txt` content:

```
alembic>=0.8.3, <0.9
chartkick>=0.4.2, < 0.5
croniter>=0.3.8, <0.4
flask-admin==1.2.0
flask-cache>=0.13.1, <0.14
flask-login==0.2.11
Flask-WTF==0.12
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

And after applying state first time I expect not to get the following message:

```
----------
          ID: celery
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: celery == 3.1.18
      Result: True
     Comment: Successfully processed requirements file salt://airflow/etc/requirements.txt.
     Started: 18:01:38.860175
    Duration: 992.349 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              requirements:
                  True
```

But I get. Moreover, if there is no requirements requisite applying state happens silently.
