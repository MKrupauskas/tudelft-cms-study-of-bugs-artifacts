Hello,

since I switched to repo.saltstack.com for my debian packages, I am having trouble upgrading to 2015.5.9. It seems control file is having an a hard dependency on sysvinit-core or python-systemd for salt-master package, however there is no python-systemd package available. Maybe it is intended to be distributed by saltstack repository as well but this is not the case currently so I am currently stuck with debian backports as I do not want to switch existing systems init.

I checked control file from:
http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/2015.5/salt_debian.tar.xz

Also salt-master is the only package causing problem, minion and cloud are fine.
