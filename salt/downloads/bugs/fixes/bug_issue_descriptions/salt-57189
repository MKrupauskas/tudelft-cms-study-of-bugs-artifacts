**Description**

The `attrs` option of `file.managed` attempts to change file attributes, even if they match except for the `e` (extents) attribute.
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Setup**

```
/tmp/immutable-file:
   file.managed:
     - contents: ''
     - attrs: 'i'
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Whether this problem can be reproduced depends on details of the file system used on the minion. When the file system stores the file in a way that it uses extents, the following behavior will be visible:

When apply the state for the first time, everything looks fine. When subsequently applying the state in test mode, the output will look like this:

```
          ID: /tmp/immutable-file
    Function: file.managed
        Name: /tmp/immutable-file
      Result: None
     Comment: The file /tmp/immutable-file is set to be changed
              Note: No changes made, actual changes may
              be different due to other states.
     Started: 16:49:48.657780
    Duration: 29.804 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              attrs:
                  i
```

When actually applying the change again, the state will fail because the immutable attribute is already set and thus `chattr` cannot be used (except for removing the immutable attribute).

```
          ID: /tmp/immutable-file
    Function: file.managed
        Name: /tmp/immutable-file
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to change attributes to i
     Started: 16:31:04.937077
    Duration: 113.853 ms
     Changes:
```

**Expected behavior**

The `file.managed` state should ignore the `e` (extents) attribute if it is set but not specified as part of the `attrs` option.

From the manpage of `chattr (1)`:

       The 'e' attribute indicates that the file is using extents for  mapping
       the blocks on disk.  It may not be removed using chattr(1).
