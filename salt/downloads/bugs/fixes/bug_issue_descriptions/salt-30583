The following state generates bogus diff output when a line matching `GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=` is present in `/etc/default/grub`:

``` yaml
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT:
  file.line:
    - name: /etc/default/grub
    - mode: delete
    - content: 'GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT='
```

This is the output when running a highstate:

```
          ID: GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT
    Function: file.line
        Name: /etc/default/grub
      Result: True

```

The changes applied are as expected (the line matching `GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT=` is deleted) but the diff shows something different.
