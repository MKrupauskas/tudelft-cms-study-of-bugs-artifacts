**Description**

Occasional errors have been observed loading the s3fs cache.  I've investigated a handful of theories on what might be happening in the particular customer environment, but can not reproduce.  However, it seems appropriate in this case to return no data from the cache lookup and continue, as is done with several other exceptions: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/9e1caa2d4b6fd49411a18eb0a33568017b72dad6/salt/fileserver/s3fs.py#L596-L607
