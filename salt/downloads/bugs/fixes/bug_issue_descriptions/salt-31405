1. Create a simple state to manage `$file`
2. If your filesystem is ext[2-4], as root, run: `chattr +i $file`
3. Run salt

Expected behavior:
- Salt would cleanup any tmp files it lays down using a try/except/finally pattern

Actual behavior:
- Salt leaves tmp files on the filesystem

If your state is for /etc/cron.d/foo, but /etc/cron.d/foo is immutable, salt will leave /etc/cron.d/fooXXyWza1 or something arbitrary like that. This causes serious issues as then crond thinks there are multiple crontabs. Hilarity ensues.
