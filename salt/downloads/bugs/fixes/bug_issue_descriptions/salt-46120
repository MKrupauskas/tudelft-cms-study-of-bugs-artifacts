### Description of Issue/Question

There are some trivial bugs in the tagify and fire_args functions (suggested fixes submitted in 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/46024). The TypeError exception is triggered in tagify by the `tag_suffix = [jid, 'args']` assigment in the fire_args function, and that exception triggers the UnboundLocalError exception in fire_args:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1493, in _thread_return
    return_data = executor.execute()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
    return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 1437, in runner
    prefix='run'
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/event.py", line 175, in fire_args
    tag = tagify(tag_suffix, prefix)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/event.py", line 203, in tagify
    return TAGPARTER.join([part for part in parts if part])
TypeError: sequence item 2: expected string, long found
```

    tag, tag_data, exc
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'tag' referenced before assignment
```

### Setup
Create a salt master, and make the salt master a minion of itself.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
The code that triggered these bugs was a call to the salt.client.LocalClient.cmd method like this:
```python
client.cmd(socket.getfqdn(), 'saltutil.runner', ['jobs.list_job'], kwarg={'arg': [jid]})
```
I have since changed my code to instead use the salt.runner.RunnerClient.cmd method, in order to achieve a similar result without triggering the bugs:
```python
client.cmd('jobs.list_job', arg=[jid])
```
