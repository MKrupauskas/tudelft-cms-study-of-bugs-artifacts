Hi,

I ran into an issue thats been bugging me for a while. In a nutshell, if I tie a Mac to the Active Directory and try to launch the salt-minion via launchd at boot / login I have to accept a 3 minute delay.

So far I tested a multitude of plists, starting with the one from pkg/darwin and working my way onwards from there, all with the same effect. Even when switching to a LaunchAgent I see the delay, however not during boot but during login.

Using the same plist on the same Mac but without ties to the Active Directory will boot without any delay.

When looking at the system.log I see a 3m delay between the start of process all plists in /Library/LaunchDaemons and the next steps.

If you can provide me with a hint / suggestion / guidance where to look next for troubleshooting I'm happy to help.

Cheers!
