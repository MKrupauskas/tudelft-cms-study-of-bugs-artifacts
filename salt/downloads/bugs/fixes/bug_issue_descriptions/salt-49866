### Description of Issue/Question

`gem.installed` is not coping with mixed output (specifically the dictionaries that appear alongside strings) from `gem.list` and as a result it never recognizes that the desired gem is already installed, thus always reinstalling it and causing changes where none are needed.

I am in the process of switching from `rvm` to `rbenv` and this problem was discovered during this migration.

### Setup

[Code in question](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/gem.py#L86):
```
    gems = __salt__['gem.list'](name, ruby, gem_bin=gem_bin, runas=user)
    if name in gems and version is not None and str(version) in gems[name]:
        ret['result'] = True
        ret['comment'] = 'Gem is already installed.'
        return ret
    elif name in gems and version is None:
        ret['result'] = True
        ret['comment'] = 'Gem is already installed.'
        return ret
```
which runs against the two flavors of output below:

`rbenv` system output (no strings, just a dictionary):
```
$ sudo salt-call --local gem.list json
local:
    ----------
    json:
        - default: 2.1.0
```
`rvm` system output (mix of strings and a dictionary):
```
$  sudo salt-call --local gem.list json
local:
    ----------
    json:
        - 1.8.6
        - 1.8.3
        - default: 1.8.1
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
It appears that the code is only able to interpret the strings and not the dictionaries. In the `rbenv` case, there is only a dictionary so that means when running this:
```
# cat /srv/salt/test1.sls
json Gem Installed:
  gem.installed:
    - name: json
    - version: '2.1.0'
```
I always see:
```
[INFO    ] Executing command ['gem', 'list', 'json'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: json (default: 2.1.0)
[INFO    ] Executing command ['/usr/local/rbenv/bin/rbenv', 'rehash'] in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command ['gem', 'install', 'json', '--version', '2.1.0', '--no-rdoc', '--no-ri'] in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: Building native extensions. This could take a while...
Successfully installed json-2.1.0
1 gem installed
```
There should not have been any install because the current version satisfies the desired end state.
