Hi all,

We have salt-minions deployed to about 1800 or so PCs, and we recently upgraded the salt master, how do we migrate these WIndows minions to our new salt-master?

I suppose there's a config file somewhere in the Windows system, but trying to look up a process got me no where.

My GSuite Google privileges don't give me access to google groups (ugh)
