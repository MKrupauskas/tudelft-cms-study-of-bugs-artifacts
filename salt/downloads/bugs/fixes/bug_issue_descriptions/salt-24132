I'm not _quite_ sure where this fault lies yet, but I'll present what I have below, and what I've done so far to trace it.

What I'm doing: I have some sensu checks that are tied to a given "subscription", which I'm managing on a per-state basis. The sensu server should, however, have all these check types written out so that it can assign checks as necessary. I have the following:

yaml template file of sensu checks:

```
checks:
  https_alive:
    command: curl -s -kLI https://localhost/
    interval: 30
    subscribers: [https]
    handlers: [flapjack]
    type: metric
```

State that'll write this out on the sensu server (these are actually in a loop on the real setup, but this example suffices):

```
include:
  - sensu.server

{% set role = 'https' %}
{% set components = ["monitoring/files/maps/", role] %}
{% set ifilepath = components|join('') %}
{% import_yaml ifilepath as contents %}
{{ role }} sensu role subscriptions:
  file.managed:
      - name: /etc/sensu/conf.d/{{ role }}.json
      - contents: {{ contents | json }}
      - watch_in: 
        - service: sensu-server
```

On my sensu server, I see the following file content:

```
root@monitor:/etc/sensu/conf.d# cat https.json
{'checks': {'https_alive': {'type': 'metric', 'interval': 30, 'command': 'curl -s -kLI https://localhost/', 'subscribers': ['https'], 'handlers': ['flapjack']}}}
```

This isn't valid JSON. I've found https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/4ZIZlFjM1e8 previously, but it's not quite right.

Some digging has revealed the following:

I tweak the config file on the server to force a salt update, and then in a highstate run with debug logging, I see the following in the render result:

```
https sensu role subscriptions:
  file.managed:
      - name: /etc/sensu/conf.d/https.json
      - contents: {"checks": {"https_alive": {"command": "curl -s -kLI https://localhost/", "handlers": ["flapjack"], "interval": 30, "subscribers": ["https"], "type": "metric"}}}
      - watch_in:
        - service: sensu-server
```

Looks right, has double quotes. However, later on the file.managed state/function does the following:

```
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad file.mod_init

This leads me to believe that somewhere there's something that is conflating quotes.
