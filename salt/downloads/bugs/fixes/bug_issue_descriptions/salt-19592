I was trying to use 'onchanges' to execute a state whenever any of several other states change, but it seems the logic currently requires _all_ the states to change before an 'onchanges' state will execute.

Basically, I have four states that configure a registry setting (my minions are Windows boxes). If any of those states result in a change, I'd like to execute a cmd.run state. Is 'onchanges' not the right way to do that?

Not sure if this is a feature request, a bug, or a usage question...
