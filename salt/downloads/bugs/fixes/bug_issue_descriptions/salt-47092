### Description of Issue/Question

There are a few psuedo packages in the repo: `php7.0-redis`, `php7.1-redis` etc are all actually `php-redis`. 

With versions prior to 2018.3.0 this worked fine. However, a highstate with a 2018.3.0 minion results in:

```
          ID: php7.0-redis
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: php7.0-redis
     Started: 11:55:47.567707
    Duration: 422.623 ms
     Changes:   
```

The package is however (already) installed. Installing it by hand shows no errors:

```
root@testing01:~# apt install php7.0-redis
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Note, selecting 'php-redis' instead of 'php7.0-redis'
php-redis is already the newest version (4.0.0-1+ubuntu16.04.1+deb.sury.org+1).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 4 not upgraded.
```

Why is Salt giving an error? I couldn't find anything in the changelogs regarding to this.
Digging some more, it appears that this may have been caused by changes done in #44455 in regards to virtual packages.

### Setup
```
php7.0-redis:
  pkg.installed
```
