It appears that when you use both unless and onlyif in a state definition, onlyif takes precedence over unless and the unless statement is ignored. I would expect both onlyif and unless to be run to verify whether or not a state should be run. Here is an example.

```
[root@server1 test]# pwd
/vagrant/salt/test

[root@server1 test]# cat init.sls
test:
  file.managed:
    - name: /test.txt
    - contents: test
    - unless: echo 1
    - onlyif: echo 0

[root@server1 test]# salt-call state.sls test --state-output=verbose

When I remove the onlyif, the unless gets executed.

```
