After upgrading to docker 2015.5.0 the `docker.running` and `docker.installed` states always return an error in the following form for quay.io/\* images, when using docker 1.5.0.

```
image "quay.io/xyz/abc" does not exist
```

It's unlikely this is specific to quay.io, since the images are already locally downloaded on the minions when this error occurs. This appears to be due to the combination to #23610 and #13305.

We were able to work around the issue by upgrading to docker 1.6.1, but that might not be an option for everyone.

In case it's helpful here's the docker and salt information:
