Everything worked in 2014.1.3, to test as soon as I installed 2014.1.4 it stopped working.

Having this as pillar data on the minion.

```
docker-registries:
    https://index.private.io/v1:
        username: test
        password: test
        email: test@test.com
```

sudo salt '_minion_' docker.pull index.private.io/project/image:latest --timeout 300

That command always results in a 403 error now, the authentication information is no longer being sent.
