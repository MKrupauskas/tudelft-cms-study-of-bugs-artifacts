I'm having a problem with a file.managed state when running state.highstate.

The state works for some minions, but not for others.  The minions that it fails on seem random - it is not always the same minions.

Here is a traceback that shows the error:

``` python-traceback

```

This is the state:

``` sls
linuxlab-disable-shutdown-file:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/disable-shutdown.pkla
    - source: salt://files/disable-shutdown.pkla
    - saltenv: linuxlab
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644
```

Are you seeing any errors in the master debug log? I wonder if this could be a fileserver error that's giving invalid data to the minions? - Colton Myers

I'm haven't found anything in the logs yet, but it does seem to related to the fileserver.  If I move the files off of the master server to a web server, everything works as it should.  Why would the fileserver be causing issues?  Did I do something wrong? - JRB

Actually I saw the word "hash" and assumed the fileserver. It looks like there may be a bug in the file module itself, based on the stacktrace. Would you mind submitting an issue on Github? - Colton Myers
