### Description of Issue/Question

Installing a headless/unattended Windows server with salt minion is failing due to the fact that the built-in Visual Code redistributable is not honouring the `/S` flag on minion installation. This does not appear to afflict the python2 redist installation (or, it's preinstalled).

I was able to successfully provision a machine by installing the redist manually and passing the `/install /quiet /noreboot` flags on the command line- then installing salt-minion with `/S` as normal.


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
* Install Windows
* Download Python3 version of Salt Minion 2017.7.2
* Run as Administrator
* Witness the VC_Redist open a window with a progress bar. (this step causes failure in headless environments)
