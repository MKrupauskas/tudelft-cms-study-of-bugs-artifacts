salt-ssh generated a salt-thin package with a wrong salt-call file. 
- salt 0.17.0 installed via pip [the following result is from a Mac OS X 10.8 env, but I've tested on a Ubuntu 12.04 with the same result] 
- minion box1 is a Ubuntu 12.04 
- ssh auth used public key
- I can run raw command with salt-ssh on box1 without any problem

`sudo salt-ssh -l debug box1 test.ping`
