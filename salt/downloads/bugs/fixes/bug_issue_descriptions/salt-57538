I have found that configuring a master to use `job_cache: False` results in `publish.publish` calls from a minion receiving an empty return from the master despite the peer returning a complete response to the master.

This does in fact make some sense that the result is discarded and the isn't query-able to be returned to the caller so I'm uncertain if this is missing documentation or a functional bug.

I was able to reproduce this on `3000.2`, `2019.2.4`, `2019.2.5`.
