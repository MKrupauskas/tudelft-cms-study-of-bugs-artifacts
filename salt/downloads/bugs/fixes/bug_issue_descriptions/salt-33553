### Description of Issue/Question

I manage different sets of servers. By sets I mean "one master + several minions" and every set is unrelated to each other, they are independent. On one set, I updated salt (2015.5.3) to the latest version (2016.3.0) to check for any functional regressions.

The nodegroups configuration now produce different results after update.
### Setup

salt-master relevant configuration part

```
nodegroups:
  Linux: '* and G@kernel:Linux and not G@virtual_subtype:LXC'
  LXC: '* and G@kernel:Linux and G@virtual_subtype:LXC'
```

This allows me to target the physical servers (Linux) and LXC containers.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

With version 2015.5.3 (and all versions I worked with before that) `salt '*' test.ping'`, `salt -N Linux test.ping` and `salt -N LXC test.ping` work exactly as expected.

Starting with version 2015.8.10, including 2016.3.0 we have : 
- `salt '*' test.ping` => Works as expected : **OK**
- `salt -N LXC test.ping` => Returns `True` from all LXC targets then stales for some time and returns `Minion did not return. [Not connected]` from all physical servers which should NOT have been targeted in the first place!
- `salt -N Linux test.ping` => Returns

```
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
