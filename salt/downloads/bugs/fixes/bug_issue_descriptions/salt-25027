Using the external pillar 'git' allows you to map branches to environments like described here: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/pillar/all/salt.pillar.git_pillar.html?highlight=ext_pillar%20git

Anyways, the update function inside the git_pillar.py does not handle those values correctly. It just passes the entire value as 'branch' to the GitPillar class, which fails to checkout the branch:

```
[ERROR   ] Unable to checkout branch branch:env: 'git checkout origin/branch:env' returned with exit code 1
stderr: 'error: pathspec 'origin/branch:env' did not match any file(s) known to git.'
```
