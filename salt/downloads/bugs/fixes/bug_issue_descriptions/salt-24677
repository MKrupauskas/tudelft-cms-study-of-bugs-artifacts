I'm working with ebuild module and pkg state. I'm trying add correct support portage flags. In pkg.latest installed and available versions are compared, so if available version (which appeared using latest_available function) is lower than installed, package won't be installed. But in gentoo package could be reinstalled even when available version lower or equal than installed. 
I think, that if latest_available function returned latest version independent of installed package, would be great. In pkg state this change won't create bugs because in that state versions are being compared anyway.
