### Description of Issue/Question
On MacOS the latest minion 2018.3.0 is not recognised by the master.

We are were using salt with 2017.7.2 on both master and minions on both MacOS and Windows, then upgraded the master to 2018.3.0. All the currently set-up machines are still working fine. We upgraded the Windows machines to 2018.3.0, all good. Mac machines are still on 2017.7.2.
Now we are setting up new MacOS machines and found that using the latest minion 2018.3.0 doesn't connect to the master anymore, but previous version 2017.7.2 does work.

### Setup
MacOS El capitan

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The way the machine is setup is simply:
- install the minion with the package
- run `salt-config -i "machine-name" -m "salt.company.domain.net"

We have the auto-accept option on master so after that, the machine is normally added automatically to the key list and works.

Now with the latest version, we install the new package (from a clean machine), run the same salt-config, but the machine is not added to the master key list nor visible.
If running a `salt-call test.ping` from the machine, then the machine is accepted on the master and can successfully apply a state. However, calling any command from the master, even a `salt 'machine' test.ping`, will fail.

The master can successfully ping the machine with a normal `ping ip.address`

It looks like the minion can access the master fine and do transaction (the master sending information too), but the master cannot see the minion by itself.
