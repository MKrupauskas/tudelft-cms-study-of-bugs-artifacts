``` yaml
/usr/local/etc/salt/minion.d/:
  file.recurse:
    - source: salt://templates/salt/minion.d/
    - makedirs: true
    - keep_symlinks: true
    - force_symlinks: true
    - user: root
    - group: wheel
    - file_mode: 0644
    - dir_mode: 0755
    - sym_mode: 0755
    - watch_in:
      - service: salt_minion running

salt_minion running:
  service.running:
    - enable: true
    - name: salt_minion
    - config: /etc/rc.conf
```

 Running this state via `salt-call` makes it never return:

``` bash
root@myminion:/usr/home/yz # salt-call -l debug state.sls salt
[...]
[INFO    ] The service salt_minion is already running
[INFO    ] Completed state [salt_minion] at time 15:22:25.222752

```

But if I use `service.restart` it works and I see it using `service.restart` instead of `service.full_restart`:

``` bash
root@myminion:/usr/home/yz # salt-call -l debug service.restart salt_minion
[...]
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded jinja.render

```

Could someone please take a look at it?
There is no such a problem with CentOS and Ubuntu. Only FreeBSD is affected. And I guess it has appeared in 2015.8 version =(
