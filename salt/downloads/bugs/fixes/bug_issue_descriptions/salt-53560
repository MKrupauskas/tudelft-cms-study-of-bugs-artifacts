### Description of Issue

I'm running Alpine docker containers. Alpine 3.10 has just been released and pygit2 has been bumped from 0.27.1-r0 to 0.28.2-r0. Now my GITFS repos are failing.

I'm using HTTPS as a transport, but I see the same behaviour using SSH keys.

GitPython does not experience the same issue.

#### HTTPS

```


### Setup

I can reproduce this with a single salt-master and a private git repo. The trigger seems to be the version of pygit2.

#### gitfs.conf
```
fileserver_backend:
  - gitfs

gitfs_remotes:
  - https://git-codecommit.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/salt-states:
    - user: ############
    - password: ##########
```



### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The following steps reproduce the issue for me:
```
docker run -it alpine:3.10
apk add git salt-master
mkdir /etc/salt/master.d
vi /etc/salt/master.d/gitfs.conf
Configure a GITFS with a git repo requring authentication
salt-master -l info
```
