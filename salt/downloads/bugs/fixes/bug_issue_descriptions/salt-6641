user.present doesn't create user on Windows Server 2012.

Interestingly enough, I've seen two different ways saltstack reports the issue. I experiment on a VM installation, so can do a fresh saltstack assisted setup, so originally I got on salt-master the error below:

```
    State: - user
    Name:      testuser01
    Function:  present
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "salt/state.py", line 1239, in call
    File "salt/states/user.py", line 367, in present
    TypeError: add() got an unexpected keyword argument 'createhome'
```

And now, after few changes all over the place, on fresh windows installation the salt-master doesn't even report the error, the only trace about attempt to create the user I get from salt-minion logs:

```
    ...
    2013-08-12 15:56:06,252 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ] No changes made for far
    2013-08-12 15:56:08,748 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ] No changes made for winscp
    2013-08-12 15:56:08,780 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ] No changes made for testuser01
    ...
```

where the first two entries are not really errors even though reported as ERROR (to my understanding, as those already installed on the box), and the third one states that no changes done to testuser01, and indeed, it wasn't created, which is a problem.

Below are init.sls with regards to user creating

```
    testuser01:
      user.present:
        - name: testuser01
        - fullname: Test User 01
        - password: ABC123321ABC
        - groups:
          - administrators
```

```
