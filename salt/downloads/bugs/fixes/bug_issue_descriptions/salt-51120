### Description of Issue/Question

It is impossible to cleanly switch vendors for already installed packages with zypper/rpm. My example is that I need to install a package (ffmpeg-4) which depends on packages that are provided both by the 'main' vendor (OpenSUSE) and the 'secondary' vendor (packman). The ffmpeg-4 package requires the packages from the packman vendor, but if these are installed it becomes impossible to switch.

### Setup

OpenSUSE Tumbleweed,  salt installed from packages, running on a masterless setup ( `salt-call --local`).

```

import_packman_gpg_key:
    cmd.run:
        - name: rpm --import http://packman.inode.at/gpg-pubkey-1abd1afb.asc
        - unless: rpm -q gpg-pubkey-1abd1afb-54176598

packman-essentials:
    pkgrepo.managed:
        - baseurl: http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/packman/suse/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/Essentials/
        - humanname: Packman (Essentials)
        - refresh: 1
    require:
        - cmd: import_packman_gpg_key

install_packman_multimedia:
    pkg.installed:
        - pkgs:
            - libavcodec56
            - libavcodec57
            - libswresample3
            - libavfilter7
            - libavcodec58
            - libavformat58
            - libswscale5
            - libavutil56
            - libpostproc55
            - libavresample4
            - ffmpeg-4
        - fromrepo: packman-essentials
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Applying the highstate (which includes the above states) results in a zypper error

```
----------
          ID: install_packman_multimedia
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: An error was encountered while installing package(s): Zypper command failure: Check Zypper's logs.
     Started: 16:01:36.789479
    Duration: 1390.71 ms
     Changes: 
```

The console shows the following:

```
[ERROR   ] Command '['zypper', '--non-interactive', '--no-refresh', '--no-refresh', 'install', '--auto-agree-with-licenses', '--name', '--force', '--force-resolution', '--from', 'packman-essentials', 'ffmpeg-4']' failed with return code: 4
[ERROR   ] stdout: Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Forcing installation of 'ffmpeg-4-4.1-5.2.x86_64' from repository 'packman-essentials'.
Resolving package dependencies...

Problem: ffmpeg-4-4.1-5.2.x86_64 requires libswresample3 = 4.1-5.2, but this requirement cannot be provided
  not installable providers: libswresample3-4.1-5.2.i586[packman-essentials]
                   libswresample3-4.1-5.2.x86_64[packman-essentials]
 Solution 1: install libswresample3-4.1-5.2.x86_64 (with vendor change)
  openSUSE  -->  http://packman.links2linux.de
 Solution 2: do not install ffmpeg-4-4.1-5.2.x86_64
 Solution 3: break ffmpeg-4-4.1-5.2.x86_64 by ignoring some of its dependencies

Choose from above solutions by number or cancel [1/2/3/c] (c): c
```

Note that salt tries to install only ffmpe4, but I asked for more libraries to be installed. This is because I am using the `--from` switch which in practice would switch packages.

If I manually run a zypper install command with all packages this works:

```
$ sudo zypper in --allow-vendor-change  --from packman-essentials vlc ffmpeg-4 libswresample3 libavfilter7 libavcodec58 libavformat58 libswscale5 libavutil56 libpostproc55 libavresample4
```

I am not sure which is the best way here. Some options would be:

- when `pkgs` is used, pass all the packages to the install command, even if already installed.
- when `fromrepo` is used, always try to install the package since it may lead to switching the package vendor/source
- add an option to pass all packages to the install command

I have tried setting `reinstall: True` but that has a couple of downsides:

- always reinstalls the packages
- always logs error messages, such as below
