Using salt 2014.7.2 (Helium), I've got an orchestration job like:

```
{% set target = salt['pillar.get']('target') %}
{% set shorttarget = target.split('.')[0] %}

varnish-pull:
  salt.function:
    - tgt: cache1
    - name: cmd.run
    - arg:
      - varnishadm backend.set_health {{ shorttarget }} sick
```

The mentioned varnishadm command requires 3 arguments. If `{{ shorttarget }}` is not defined, the command exits non zero and returns with:

```
Unknown request.
Type 'help' for more info.
Too few parameters
```

But salt reports

```

          ID: varnish-pull
    Function: salt.function
        Name: cmd.run
      Result: True
     Comment: Function ran successfully. Function cmd.run ran on cache1.
     Started: 22:59:53.415799
    Duration: 326.225 ms
     Changes:
              cache1:
                  Command failed with error code 104
              Unknown request.
              Type 'help' for more info.
              Too few parameters

```

This is especially problematic in orchestration since I don't wish to have subsequent jobs continue when a prerequisite fails.
