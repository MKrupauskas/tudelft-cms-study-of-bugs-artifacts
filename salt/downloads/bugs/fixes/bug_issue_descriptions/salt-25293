Issue reported here by @RobertFach: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18630#issuecomment-69907611

I'm creating a separate issue to trace this somewhat different from #18630 issue.

With a CIFS mount, using `uid/gid=` option with a name instead of a numeric id, the state is always forced to remount. This is because the options for the actual mount is reported with the numeric id, not the name.

On a Linux kernel, and salt 2014.7.5
