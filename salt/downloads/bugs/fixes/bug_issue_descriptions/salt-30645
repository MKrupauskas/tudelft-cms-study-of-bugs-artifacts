```
salt-ssh nas --priv=/root/.ssh/id_rsa -r "echo test >> /home/bob/myfile" --output=json --ignore-host-keys
{
    "nas": "/bin/sh: 1: cannot create /home/bob/myfile: Directory nonexistent\n"
}
```

Directory /home/bob exists. It doesn't change if myfile exists or not, I get the same error
It's impossible to use >> or >, can you fix that?

Thanks
