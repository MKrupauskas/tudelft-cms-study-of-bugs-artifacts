Hi.

I am trying to improve my recently committed openbsdrcctl module to
better handle service flags changes etc

Consider the following state: /srv/salt/tftpd/init.sls

```
tftpd:
  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
    - flags: /tftpboot
```

I am trying to understand why kwargs.get will always return empty when
called from enabled() while it returns the proper flags when called from
enable().
I added a logger to confirm that:

```
enable()
[INFO    ] ===> tftpd flags set to "/tftpboot"

enabled()
[INFO    ] ===> tftpd flags set to ""
```

_BUT_ this only happens when running highstate or state.sls tftp.
If I run this:

```
    salt '*' service.enabled tftpd flags=/tftpboot
```

then enabled() properly return the value of flags!!!???

```
([INFO    ] ===> tftpd flags set to "/tftpboot")
```

I am pretty sure I am missing something really stupid :-)
Here is the  patch that demonstrates the problem:
