Hi

If I run the ssh_auth.present state on a FreeBSD host its very slow. 
FreeBSD Version:
salt-minion 2015.5.3 (Lithium)

Ubuntu Version:
salt-minion 2015.5.3 (Lithium)
salt-master 2015.5.3 (Lithium)

Each Keys takes more than half a second:

```
      ID: xyz1@test.com
Function: ssh_auth.present
    Name: xxxxx      Result: True
 Comment: The authorized host key xxxxx is already present for user root
 Started: 16:33:56.772581
Duration: 718.027 ms

```

```
      ID: xyz2@test.com
Function: ssh_auth.present
    Name: xxxxx
  Result: None
 Comment: Key xxxxx for user root is set to be added
 Started: 16:33:57.491080
Duration: 713.499 ms

```
      ID: xyz3@test.com
Function: ssh_auth.present
    Name: xxxxx
  Result: None
 Comment: Key xxxxx for user root is set to be added
 Started: 16:33:58.205059
Duration: 664.608 ms

```

It doesn't matter if I run it local on a host or from salt-master.

If I execute the same on a Ubuntu host it takes about 2ms per key.

Does anybody have an idea why it takes so long on FreeBSD?

Best Regards
