My recent issues (#16773, #17313, #18291) boil down to salt-ssh taking system-level Python libraries on my host, Ubuntu 14.10, and attempting to use these on the target machine.  In my case, because the libraries (requests, urllib3 -- so far) have been patched specifically for Ubuntu/Debian, they understandably fail to work on my RHEL/CentOS targets.  Whilst certain cases (#19321, #18291) can be worked around, _any_ Python library used by Salt/salt-ssh is thus a source of potential cross-platform incompatibilities.

So, Salt/salt-ssh essentially needs to avoid copying system libraries entirely.  The original code for each of these libraries is cross-distribution compatible, so what about drawing them from PyPI/GitHub before rolling them into the thin tarball, or otherwise maintaining a virtualenv specifically for salt-ssh's dependencies?  Either way, usage of the system libraries needs to be avoided.

For what it's worth, in order to make my salt-ssh work, I've taken to hacking the copies of my libraries on my host to restore the distribution-agnostic code (as per #17313), but this will only stick until a  package upgrade comes around.  Replacing the Python packages entirely with from PyPI is not an option because other applications rely on the packages `python-requests` and `python-urllib3` being present.
