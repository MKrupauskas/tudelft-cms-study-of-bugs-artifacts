On debian, python modules that are able to be shared between python versions are symbolic linked into the relevant site(dist)-packages directory.

When salt-ssh copies the files across, it preserves these links which means it doesn't work. Errors like:

```
unstable-sshmin:
    Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.
    stdin: is not a tty
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt-call", line 7, in <module>
        from salt.scripts import salt_call
    ImportError: No module named salt.scripts

```
