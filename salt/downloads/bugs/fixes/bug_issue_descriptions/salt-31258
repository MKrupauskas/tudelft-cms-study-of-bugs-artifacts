Using 

```
postgres_database_test:
  postgres_database.present:
    - name: test
    - encoding: UTF-8
    - owner: test
```

the provisiong works as expected. However, running state.highstate afterwards throws an error:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/bin/psql --no-align --no-readline --no-password --dbname test -v datestyle=ISO,MDY -c \'COPY (SELECT datname as "Name", pga.rolname as "Owner", pg_encoding_to_char(encoding) as "Encoding", datcollate as "Collate", datctype as "Ctype", datacl as "Access privileges", spcname as "Tablespace" FROM pg_database pgd, pg_roles pga, pg_tablespace pgts WHERE pga.oid = pgd.datdba AND pgts.oid = pgd.dattablespace) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER\'' as user 'postgres' in directory '/var/lib/postgresql'
[ERROR   ] Database test has wrong parameters which couldn't be changed on fly.
```

Checking the database the column Encoding (from table `pg_database` column `encoding` is `6` = `UTF-8`) is already `UTF-8` so it shouldnâ€™t even try to change anything.

Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong here?
