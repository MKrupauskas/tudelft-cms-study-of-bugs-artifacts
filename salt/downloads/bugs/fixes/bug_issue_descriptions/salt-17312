If you run this:

``` yaml
myelb:
  boto_elb.present:
    - name: myelb
    - security_groups:
      - test
      - test2
```

Then you run this:

``` yaml
myelb:
  boto_elb.present:
    - name: myelb
    - security_groups:
      - test
```

myelb will still have the test2 security group associated with it.
