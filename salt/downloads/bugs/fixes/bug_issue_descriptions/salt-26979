The new winrepo code (which uses salt.utils.gitfs) will check out winrepo remotes into directory names which are hashes of the remote URL. While this results in unique names, it makes it much more complicated to use functions like [state.show_sls](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.state.html#salt.modules.state.show_sls) to examine the contents of the checked-out git repos.

While this is not a functional regression, it should be considered a regression in terms of usability.
