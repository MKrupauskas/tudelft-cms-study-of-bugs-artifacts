Salt Cloud is outputting the entire contents of the bootstrap script TWICE when in debug mode.

I'm using salt-cloud from the very latest on the develop branch and using the GCE provider. I'm not sure if this is specific to GCE or not.

This is a ton of ugly output that makes it terribly difficult to troubleshoot problems due to all the clutter. This should be moved to TRACE or removed entirely.
