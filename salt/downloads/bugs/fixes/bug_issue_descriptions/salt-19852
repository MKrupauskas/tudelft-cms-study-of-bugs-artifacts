If you don't have enough VMs for a second page and you try to delete one, it fails with

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to execute 'digital_ocean.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: 'pages'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2195, in run_parallel_map_providers_query
    cloud.clouds[data['fun']]()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/digital_ocean_v2.py", line 164, in list_nodes
    fetch = 'next' in items['links']['pages']
KeyError: 'pages'
No machines were found to be destroyed
```

I'm guessing some sort of condition needs to be set before the while
