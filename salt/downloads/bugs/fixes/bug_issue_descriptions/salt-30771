The output of [ssh_auth.present](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.ssh_auth.html#salt.states.ssh_auth.present) s not as expected:

The same output happens for these cases:
- file was not present before and gets created
- file was present and modified
- file was present and not modified since all keys are already present

```
