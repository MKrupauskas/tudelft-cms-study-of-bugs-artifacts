I have something like this:

``` yaml
awesome_service:
    service.running:
        - enable: true
        - watch:
            - file: /etc/init/awesome_service.conf
```

And then I have a command which I want to get executed after whenever this service is started:

``` yaml
do some testing:
    cmd.wait:
        - name: foo.sh
        - watch:
            - service: awesome service
        - require:
            - pkg: awesome tool
```

If I manually stop the service and run the states, I get this:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state service.running for awesome service
[INFO    ] Executing command 'runlevel /run/utmp' in directory '/home/vagrant'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'service awesome_service status' in directory '/home/vagrant'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'service awesome_service start' in directory '/home/vagrant'
[INFO    ] Service awesome_service is already enabled, and is running
```

```
    State: - cmd
    Name:     foo.sh
    Function:  wait
        Result:    True
        Comment:
        Changes:
```

The command is not triggered.
However, if I delete `- enable: true` and do the same test, the command gets ran.
