### Description of Issue
Looks like we have some kind of race condition in the reactor system when passing pillar data to orchestration. 

### Setup
The setup I used to test this was based on `salt-api` webhooks. to send data from the webhook into the reactor and carry that data into orchestration that holds saltify cloud.profile. 

The reactors all rendered 100% correctly. But the orchestrations were all over the place. Some repeating pillar information and in one case no pillar information was rendered.

The orchestration that rendered without any pillar data came from an attempt to mitigate issue using sleep of 1 second in-between sending the webhooks

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
config files

**/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/saltify.conf**
```
salty:
  driver: saltify
```
**/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/saltify_host.conf**
```
saltify_host:
  provider: salty
  force_minion_config: true
```

**/etc/salt/master.d/***
```
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 8000
  webhook_disable_auth: True
  disable_ssl: True
log_level_logfile: all
reactor:
  - 'salt/netapi/hook/deploy_minion':
    - /srv/salt/reactor/deploy_minion.sls
```

**/srv/salt/reactor/deploy_minion.sls**
```

# {{data}}


{% set post_data = data.get('post', {}) %}

#{{post_data}}

{% set host = post_data.get('host', '') %}

#{{host}}

{#
Initiate the Orchestration State
#}
deploy_minion_runner:
  runner.state.orch:
    - mods: orch.minion.deploy
    - pillar:
        params:
          host: {{ host }}
```
**/srv/salt/orch/minion/deploy.sls**
```
{% set errors = [] %}
{% set params = salt['pillar.get']('params', {}) %}

{% if 'host' not in params %}
{% do errors.append('Please provide a host') %}
{% set host = '' %}
{% else %}
{% set host = params.get('host') %}
{% endif %}

{% if errors|length > 0 %}
preflight_check:
  test.configurable_test_state:
    - name: Additional information required
    - changes: False
    - result: False
    - comment: '{{ errors|join(", ") }}'
{% else %}
preflight_check:
  test.succeed_without_changes:
    - name: 'All parameters accepted'
{% endif %}

provision_minion:
  salt.runner:
    - name: cloud.profile
    - prof: saltify_host
    - instances:
      - {{ host }}
    - require:
      - preflight_check
    - vm_overrides:
        ssh_host: {{ host }}
        ssh_username: centos
        ssh_keyfile: /etc/salt/id_rsa
        minion:
          master:
            - 172.16.22.60

sync_all:
 salt.function:
   - tgt: {{ host }}
   - name: saltutil.sync_all

#execute_highstate:
# salt.state:
#   - tgt: {{ host }}
#   - highstate: True
```

Command run

`for i in {1..8}; do curl localhost:8000/hook/deploy_minion -d host=test-${i}; done`

[master (3).log](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/files/3440696/master.3.log)

As can be seen from the log. 
deploy_minion.sls rendered in order
test-1
test-2
test-3
test-4
test-5
test-6
test-7
test-8

But deploy.sls 
rendered in order
test-8
test-2
test-3
test-1
test-7
test-6
test-6
test-5

I have not found the cause of the issue yet.
