We can add symlinks in windows, but we have no way to delete them. Windows sees symlinks differently than linux. They are seen as actual directories.

Probably need to add a win_file.py file.remove function that will handle symlinks as well as files and folders. May have to be a recursive function so that you can delete a directory that contains symlinks...

file.absent states fail when applied to either a symlink or a directory that contains a symlink

file.symlink fails if you have force: True and you run it a second time (force causes it to remove an existing symlink and recreate)
