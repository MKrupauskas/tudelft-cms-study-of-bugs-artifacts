### Description of Issue/Question
The NAPALM proxy minion currently does not set the ipv4/6 grain, which is required for using `ipcidr` targetting.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Given a standard proxy key:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: napalm
  driver: junos
  host: 10.0.0.1
  username: juniper
  passwd: juniper
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
$ salt -S '10.0.0.1' test.ping

No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.                                              
ERROR: No return received
