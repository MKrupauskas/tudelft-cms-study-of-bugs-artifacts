So i've gone through and setup my cloud.profile and providers files point to aliyun. I then run the command `[root@ip-172-31-8-86 cloud.providers.d]# salt-cloud -p aliyun_centos centos_http_01` But then I get a error back saying the following.

```
Usage: salt-cloud

salt-cloud: error: There was a profile error: The specified instance centos_http_01 not found
```

I've run the same command in debug and it looks like it is creating the machine but not assigning it the correct name (getting a default name from aliyun). Here is the debug output
