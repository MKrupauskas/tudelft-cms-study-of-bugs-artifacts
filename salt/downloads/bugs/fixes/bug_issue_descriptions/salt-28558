The following state will return a change every time - Salt thinks it needs to reinstall the package even if it already is installed.

```
$ salt-ssh vagrant-test state.single pip.installed 'django == 1.8.0'
```

This is because the module function `pip.list`, which is used [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/cfc3146b2d93dc8f567d354a07bacca25d2c54f0/salt/states/pip_state.py#L619-L621), shows `Django: 1.8` instead of `1.8.0` - this is probably just how it's listed in pip, other packages do include the `.0` on the end.

Not sure if this is a pip-specific quirk or if `salt.utils.compare_versions` should say that `1.8 == 1.8.0`.

Or maybe installing `django == 1.8.0` should just fail altogether, since it's not an actual version.
