### Description of Issue/Question
When using prereq on a state with module.run salt crashes and outputs a stacktrace. It started doing this sometime after v2016.11.8. After a little debugging the issue seems to be that module.run is wrapped in a decorator and state.py line 1796 is not expecting that.

### Setup
test.sls:
```
test1:
 cmd.run:
  - name: echo hi
  - prereq:
    - module: test2

test2:
 module.run:
  - name: test.ping
```
### Stacktrace
```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__opts__'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-call", line 11, in <module>
    salt_call()

    ret = self.call_chunks(chunks)

    running = self.call_chunk(low, running, chunks)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2345, in call_chunk
    running = self.call_chunk(chunk, running, chunks)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2362, in call_chunk
    self.pre[tag] = self.call(low, chunks, running)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1796, in call
    test = sys.modules[self.states[cdata['full']].__module__].__opts__['test']
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__opts__'
```

### Analysis
I did some debugging with a different state tree and found part of the issue.

Debugging code I added on the line before the one causing the exception:
```
log.warn("%s: %s: %s", cdata['full'], self.states[cdata['full']], self.states[cdata['full']].__module__)
```
Resulting messages illustrating the unexpected decorator:
```
...
