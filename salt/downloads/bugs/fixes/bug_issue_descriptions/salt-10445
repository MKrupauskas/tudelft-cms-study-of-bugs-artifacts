I had a look at the code to see if I could fix this myself, but I can't find the ubuntu specific service module that is supposed to do this, so if someone could give me a pointer I will have a go at fixing it.

```
vagrant@buildmgt:~$ uname -a
Linux buildmgt01 3.2.0-23-generic-pae #36-Ubuntu SMP Tue Apr 10 22:19:09 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
vagrant@buildmgt:~$ sudo service postgresql stop
