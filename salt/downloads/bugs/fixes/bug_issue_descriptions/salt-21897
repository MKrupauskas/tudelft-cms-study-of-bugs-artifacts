I think this was working in 2014.1 but when i pass a csv list of servers using

``` python
salt -L 'server,list,here' test.ping
```

it is not matching if the server names are not case sensitive.

example using 3 servers with the following case sensitive minion ids:
1. server
2. List
3. HEre

this works:

``` python
salt server test.ping
    server: True
salt list test.ping
    List: True
salt here test.ping
    HEre: True
```

this doesnt

``` python
salt -L 'server,list,here' test.ping
    server: True
```

nothing gets returned from the insensitive minion ids
