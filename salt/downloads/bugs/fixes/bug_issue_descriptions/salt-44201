Hi,

I found that the state function "service.running" is returning True on a non existing service name. I would expect it to return False in this case.

### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
Saltstack : 2017.7.1
OS : Centos 7.3

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create a state "service.running" with a service name that does not exist :
```
test_service_running:
  service.running:
    - name: aaaa
    - enable: True
```
Execute this state and the output will give you :
```
            ID: test_service_running
                  Function: service.running
                      Name: aaaa
                    Result: True
                   Comment: Running scope as unit run-19948.scope.
                            Failed to start aaaa.service: Unit not found.
                   Started: 13:38:01.413388
                  Duration: 63.058 ms
                   Changes:
```
The result is True with a comment that indicates the service was not found. The expected behavior would be that Result = False.
