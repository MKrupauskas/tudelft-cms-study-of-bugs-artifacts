This is example when I run with test=True

```
    Function: file.directory

Summary

```

There are multiple problems in this:
- The `file.directory` will be run, it will change but that is in `comment`, not in `changes`. So 
  the `changed:` in summary will not count it. This can be consider `file.directory` problem, but to fix this,
  I guess ton of states will need to be changed. So which is the way to fix this?
- This is in test mode, `test=True`, therefore when I see `changed=30`, I panicked. Why it says something changes when I run it in test mode.
