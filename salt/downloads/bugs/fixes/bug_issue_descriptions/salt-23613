A minor issue that I noticed when doing a copy/paste from the docs:

The [saltutil module docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.saltutil.html) have a title of `pillar_refresh` for the function (which is wrong) and the example shows `refresh_pillar`.

I assume it's a 2 second swap for someone.
