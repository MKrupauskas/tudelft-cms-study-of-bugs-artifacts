### Description of Issue/Question

```
[root@ch3ll-master-py3 ~]# salt-run manage.versions

Exception occurred in runner manage.versions: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/salt/salt/client/mixins.py", line 392, in _low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/root/salt/salt/runners/manage.py", line 673, in versions
    ver_diff = cmp(minion_version, master_version)
NameError: name 'cmp' is not defined
```

Seems cmp() was removed from python3.

### Setup
install salt with python3
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt-run manage.versions`
