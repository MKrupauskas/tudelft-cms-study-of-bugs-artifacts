So when I try to logout of an expired session, hitting POST /logout, I get a 401 unauthorized (my sessionid is being passed in a cookie)

```
        <h2>401 Unauthorized</h2>
        <p>No permission -- see authorization schemes</p>
        <pre id="traceback">Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cherrypy/_cprequest.py", line 661, in respond
    self.hooks.run('before_request_body')
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cherrypy/_cprequest.py", line 114, in run
    raise exc
HTTPError: (401, None)
```

So I can't clear my cookie.  But when I try a fresh login at POST /login, it gives me a 500 error

```
   <p>The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.</p>
        <pre id="traceback">Traceback (most recent call last):

    self.body = self.oldhandler(*args, **kwargs)

    child = getattr(serving, self.__attrname__)
AttributeError: '_Serving' object has no attribute 'session'
```

So I'm stuck in some sort of no-mans land where I get a 500 trying to login, but a 401 trying to clear whatever login/session it thinks it's carrying around.  I logged in fine when this machine was freshly spun up.  But now that I've been logged in for a while, I seem kinda stuck.
