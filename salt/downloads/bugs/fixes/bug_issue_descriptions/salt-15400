For me this often happens when I begin working with salt, i.e. first runs tend to be empty more often

Here is the log, which gives no clue as to what is happening at all.
salt ~ # salt   --force-color 's2._' state.highstate
salt ~ # salt   --force-color 's2._' state.highstate
salt ~ # salt   --force-color 's2.*' state.highstate
