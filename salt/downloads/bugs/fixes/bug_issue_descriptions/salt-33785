### Description of Issue/Question

In salt.states.ldap there are few directives (like replace, delete, add, default, delete_others), directive 'add' tries to replace (delete and re-add) attributes of an existing object in the back end. This is bad as in some cases it's not possible (openldap will refuse to perform). 
One example is adding a new module (in my case to setup replication) - it's not possible (with openldap 2.4) to UNLOAD module dynamically which would happen if salt would delete attribute.
### Setup

What should work but it doesnt:

```
      - 'cn=module{0},cn=config':
        - add:
            olcModuleLoad:
              - '{1}syncprov'
              - '{2}accesslog'
```

Error I get:

```
LDAPError: exception in ldap backend: OTHER({'info': 'cannot delete olcModuleLoad', 'desc': 'Other (e.g., implementation specific) error'},)
```

A workaround is to define a ldif like below and load it with ldapadd command:

```
#Load the syncprov module.
dn: cn=module{0},cn=config
changetype: modify
add: olcModuleLoad
olcModuleLoad: syncprov
```

So it's clear that 'add' doesn't really add in the background... and it should.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try to load ANY new module via ldap state, eg:

```
      - 'cn=module{0},cn=config':
        - add:
            olcModuleLoad:
              - '{1}syncprov'
```
