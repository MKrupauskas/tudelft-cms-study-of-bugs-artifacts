Strange issue...when firing events from a salt-minion using salt-calls, the salt-master reactor 'sometimes' executes the associated runner and sometimes not.  At times, it executes after 5 or 10 minutes.

Another interesting issue:  One of the salt-master forks appear to go into a 'defunct' state over a period of time.

Here is the salt-call:

```
/usr/bin/salt-call event.fire_master '{"username":$USER1}'  "instance_user" 
```

Here is the Reactor SLS:

```
instance_user:
  runners.salt_test.init:
    - username: {{ data['data']['username'] }}
  runners.test_def.init:
    - minion_id:  {{ data['id'] }}
```

runners.salt_test.init never executes the associated runner script(probably my fault).   runners.test_def.init does execute its runner with the above described outcome.

Here are the runner scripts:
salt_test.py -----------------------------

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import salt.key
import salt.output

import os

def init(username):
    f = open('/tmp/user','w')
    f.write(username) # python will convert \n to os.linesep
    f.close() # you can omit in most cases as the destructor will call if
```

test_def.py -------------------------------

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import salt.key
import salt.output

import os

def init():
    f = open('/tmp/testfile','w')
    f.write('hi there\n') # python will convert \n to os.linesep
    f.close() # you can omit in most cases as the destructor will call if
```
