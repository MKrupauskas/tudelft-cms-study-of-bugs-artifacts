Hi all

I am running salt-minion 2014.7.5 (Helium) on a Ubuntu 12.04 server at the moment.  When running highstate I see lots of the following:

```
[CRITICAL] Rendering SLS 'base:pyramid.varnish-nginx' failed: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/templates.py", line 99, in render_tmpl
    output = render_str(tmplstr, context, tmplpath)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/templates.py", line 331, in render_mako_tmpl
    import mako.exceptions
ImportError: No module named mako.exceptions
```

When trying to install mako,  it will remove salt-common and salt-minion

```
sudo apt-get install python-mako

The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  msgpack-python python-zmq dctrl-tools python-jinja2
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
Suggested packages:
  python-beaker python-mako-doc
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  salt-common salt-minion
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  python-mako
```

How can I get around this ?
