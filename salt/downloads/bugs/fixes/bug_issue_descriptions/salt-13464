There should be a correction in the documentation. `provider` is required for `my-productions-envs` as well.

Instead of this

```
my-productions-envs:
  - extends: my-develop-envs:ibmsce
    user: my-production-user@mycorp.com
    location: us-east-1
    availability_zone: us-east-1
```

It should be this:

```
my-productions-envs:
  - extends: my-develop-envs:ibmsce
    user: my-production-user@mycorp.com
    location: us-east-1
    availability_zone: us-east-1
    provider: ibmsce
```

Without it i get the following INFO message:

```
[INFO    ] There's at least one cloud driver details under the 'my-productions-envs' cloud provider alias which does not have the required 'provider' setting. Was probably just used as a holder for additional data. Removing it from the available providers listing
```

And it fails in the end with the following error message:

```
----------

    Function: cloud.present
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to create instance test.saltstackdev using profile <function profile at 0x361b1b8>, please check your configuration

Another thing to note here is, According to the following screenshot, should't the provider be already included under `my-productions-envs`?
