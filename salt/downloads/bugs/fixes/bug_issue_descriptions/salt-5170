I tried `service salt-minion restart` it doesn't work but if I'm using `/etc/init.d/salt-minion restart` it works and same with salt-master then I had:

```
# service salt-minion restart
/usr/sbin/service: line 123: exec: restart: not found
# service salt-minion stop
/usr/sbin/service: line 123: exec: stop: not found
# service salt-minion start
/usr/sbin/service: line 123: exec: start: not found
# /etc/init.d/salt-minion restart
Restarting salt minion control daemon: salt-minionStopping salt minion control daemon ....
Starting salt-minion daemon: :.
.
# /etc/init.d/salt-minion stop
Stopping salt minion control daemon ....
# /etc/init.d/salt-minion start
Starting salt-minion daemon: :.
```
