### Description of Issue/Question

When a scheduled job is executed on minions caching jobs locally, the previous scheduled job cache is overwritten. It seems like schedules jobs are cached under the same jid every-time overwriting previous cached entries. Instead of a timestamp type jid, the jid is set as "req". Is this a bug or intended by design? Is there a setting I might be missing to be able to save my cache data and keep it unique? Where does "req" come from?

### Setup
This was replicated in a small lab environment with a master and several minions. The master is on CentOS 7 and minions are on CentOS 6/7 and Oracle Linux 6/7. Each minion has the cache_jobs setting enabled (cache_jobs: True)
The same behaviour is seen on larger environments with thousands of minions. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Setup the cache jobs to enabled on the minions - cache_jobs: True

2. Add scheduled jobs 

**Job 1**
```

scheduleCoreDNSHourly:
  schedule.present:
    - function: state.sls
    - jid_include: true
    - minutes: 60
    - splay: 1800
    - enabled: True
    - job_args:
      - dns
    - job_kwargs:
        test: False

```
**Job 2**
```
scheduleCoreMailDaily:
  schedule.present:
    - function: state.sls
    - jid_include: true
    - hours: 24
    - splay: 1800
    - enabled: True
    - job_args:
      - mail
    - job_kwargs:
        test: False
```

3. Simulate schedule jobs run with schedule.run_job

**Job 1**
```
[root@saltmaster ~]# salt -G kernel:Linux schedule.run_job scheduleCoreDNSHourly
saltmaster:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreDNSHourly on minion.
    result:
        True
centos6:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreDNSHourly on minion.
    result:
        True
centos7:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreDNSHourly on minion.
    result:
        True
```
**Job 2**
```
[root@saltmaster ~]# salt -G kernel:Linux schedule.run_job scheduleCoreMailDaily
saltmaster:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreMailDaily on minion.
    result:
        True
centos6:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreMailDaily on minion.
    result:
        True
centos7:
    ----------
    comment:
        Scheduling Job scheduleCoreMailDaily on minion.
    result:
        True
```

4. Find and check in between and after scheduled runs the cached jobs with saltutil.find_cached_job , you can also check the file system at /var/cache/salt/minion/minion_jobs/ req

**Job 1**
```
[root@centos7 ~]# salt-call saltutil.find_cached_job req
local:
    ----------
    _stamp:
        2018-01-28T15:54:45.794950
    cmd:
        _return
    fun:
        state.sls
    fun_args:
        - dns
        |_
          ----------
          test:
              False
    id:
        centos7
    jid:
        req
    pid:
        3219
    retcode:
        0  
...
           ----------
            result:
                True
            start_time:
                08:54:45.757966
    schedule:
        scheduleCoreDNSHourly
    success:
        True
[root@centos7 ~]# 

```
**Job 2**
```
[root@centos7 ~]# salt-call saltutil.find_cached_job req
local:
    ----------
    _stamp:
        2018-01-28T15:54:45.794950
    cmd:
        _return
    fun:
        state.sls
    fun_args:
        - mail
        |_
          ----------
          test:
              False
    id:
        centos7
    jid:
        req
    pid:
        3219
    retcode:
        0
    return:
        ----------

...

            result:
                True
            start_time:
                08:54:45.757966
    schedule:
        scheduleCoreMailDaily
    success:
        True
[root@centos7 ~]#
