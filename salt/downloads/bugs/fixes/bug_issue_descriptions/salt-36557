The current implementations of `salt.states.postgres_privileges` and `salt.modules.postgres.privileges_grant` do not allow `function` as a valid object type for grants. From what I can tell from the source code this is just an oversight, the existing code would work just fine if `FUNCTION` was allowed as a type in [salt/modules/postgres.py#L2540](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/76dca64d03722bb4f09aeed755e1795113055eee/salt/modules/postgres.py#L2540).

Currently, Salt can't grant or revoke privileges on stored procedures.
