Hi, I'm still having issue with many windows with new latest version (2014.1.10) of the windows minion which keeps hanging many of my windows 7 Pro English machines. The system is freezing completly many times during the day, and the only way to have the machine back to a normal state is by doing a hard reset by hand... When I disabled the minion service, everything is fine. The only thing I see in the windows event log is the nssm doing the following thing in loop:

```
 salt-minion 
   START 
-----------------------
 c:\salt\salt-minion.exe 
   -c c:\salt\conf -l quiet 
   salt-minion 
   c:\salt 
------------------------
 salt-minion 
   INTERROGATE 
-------------------------
System crash no longer after the INTERROGATE.....
```

 :(
