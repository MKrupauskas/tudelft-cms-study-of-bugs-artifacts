I followed the instructions on http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/windows-package-manager.html to get Windows packages working, but when I run `salt '*' pkg.install chrome` it fails with no message or error.

Then I realised I need to put the Chrome installer on the saltmaster at `/srv/salt/win/repo/chrome/GoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise.msi`.

If I then run `pkg.install chrome` from the master, the minions copy the .msi installer to their local cache, but is still not installed.

I started from a fresh install of Windows Server 2008 R2 and installed Salt 0.17.5-51-g508bed0 straight after that.

What am I doing wrong?
