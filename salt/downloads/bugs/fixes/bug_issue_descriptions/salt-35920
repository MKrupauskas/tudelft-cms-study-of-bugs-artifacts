Hello,
### Description of Issue

On the salt master i have configured a gitfs. The "remote" git repository is located on the same server and is not very large (roughly 160MB). Today i had an alert about low free space for partition /.

Indeed the salt cache for the gitfs has grown very large (more than 6 GB). Inside the cache the directory `/var/cache/salt/master/gitfs/LONGID/.git/objects/pack` represents itself 6GB.

It seems that salt keeps a full copy of the git repository _for each commit_ that was made to the git repository. Inside `pack` I found 52 .idx files and 52 .pack files. The .pack files generally have a size > 150M. Looking at the git repository there is 55 commits so far.

So to check I commited a dummy change to git repo, then I pushed to change. Bingo, 1 minute after there is a new .pack file of 160MB...
- Is it the expected behaviour ?!
- How can i clean the gitfs cache so that it does not grow unboundly ?
### Setup

Master runs on an Ubuntu Trusty server. salt-master has been installed with the deb repo (`deb http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/ubuntu14/latest trusty main`).

In master config:

```
fileserver_backend:
  - git
  - roots

gitfs_provider: pygit2
gitfs_base: master

gitfs_remotes:
  - file:///srv/saltrepo
```

```
$ du -sh /srv/saltrepo
163M    /srv/saltrepo

$ du -sh /var/cache/salt/master/gitfs
6.2G    /var/cache/salt/master/gitfs
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Not sure so far.
