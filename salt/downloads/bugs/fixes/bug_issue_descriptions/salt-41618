Executing `salt-run badmodule.badfunction` prints “‘badmodule.badfunction’ is not available.” on the CLI but does *not* create a `salt/run/<jid>/<new|ret>` event on the event bus with that error.

That behavior makes total sense given the history of Runners but it prevents clients that are watching the event bus from seeing the error/return entirely.
