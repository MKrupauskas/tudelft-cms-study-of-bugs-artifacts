I am trying to use Salt Cloud Libvirt to create VM instances. but before anything in providers section I get error. I try this simple provider configuration:

/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/test_qemu_ssh.conf
```
local-kvm:
  driver: libvirt
  url: qemu:///system
  # work around flag for XML validation errors while cloning
  validate_xml: no

```
Then when I try to 
sudo salt-cloud --list-locations local-kvm
I get this message:
```
[WARNING ] The cloud driver, 'libvirt', configured under the 'local-kvm' cloud provider alias, could not be loaded. Please check your provider configuration files and ensure all required dependencies are installed for the 'libvirt' driver.
In rare cases, this could indicate the 'libvirt.get_configured_provider()' function could not be found.
Removing 'libvirt' from the available providers list
Error: There was an error listing locations: No cloud providers matched 'local-kvm'. Available selections:

**Additional context**
The only thing related to this issue was about somebody mistook the providers and profiles. But I don't even get to profiles step.
