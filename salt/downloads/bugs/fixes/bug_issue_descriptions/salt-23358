Hello,

perhaps this behavior is already fixed by new patches for https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18720 or by patch of issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/23034 ...
I am using 2014.7.5 (Helium) /actual Debian packet and have in 15 instances about :

```
# salt '*' grains.get alternate_dns  | wc -l
52
```

=> ~ 150 entries (I create each the public zone and 1 internal/external A record entry in an .internal and .external zone to have the real IP for internal/external configurations available on my instances)

Even when all entries are setup I get in a full run without batch mode since some days (perhaps because of new AWS IAM profile rules?):

```
