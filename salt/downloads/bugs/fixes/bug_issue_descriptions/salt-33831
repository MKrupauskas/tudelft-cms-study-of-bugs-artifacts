When using the `file.managed` state with a HTTP URL and a provided `source_hash` I would expect Salt to check the hash of an existing local file before downloading the file from the server.

This seems like a regression to me because in older versions (just tested with `salt-call 0.17.5`) the file is only downloaded once. After that, the log just prints `File ... is in the correct state`
### Setup

Salt Version: 2016.3.0 (Boron) - in **masterless local mode**
Ubuntu 14.04 trusty
Salt config / log output: https://gist.github.com/astehlik/adb8e284cd8974cba0bd2858c5bb038b
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Create a salt sate with file.managed (see Gist)
- run `salt-call state.highstate`
- file is downloaded and checksum matches
- run `salt-call state.highstate` again, file is downloaded again
