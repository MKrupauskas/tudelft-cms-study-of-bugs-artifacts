### Description of Issue/Question

When I use a domain name that only resolves to a IPv6 address for the master address in the minion config the salt-minion will exit with an error code. With an IPv4 domain, everything works as expected.

```

Feb 12 01:21:04 mail salt-minion[12340]: Permission denied (src/tcp_connecter.cpp:344)
Feb 12 01:21:04 mail systemd[1]: salt-minion.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=250/n/a
Feb 12 01:21:04 mail systemd[1]: salt-minion.service: Unit entered failed state.
Feb 12 01:21:04 mail systemd[1]: salt-minion.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
```

### Setup
Default salt-minion config, except the master entry and ipv6 switch:

```
master: ipv6-only-domain.duckdns.org
ipv6: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install a current salt-minion and change the master to a ipv6 only domain name. Then restart the salt-minion.
