We've got a state which should check if nested virtualization via kvm is enabled or not. If not it should set the required setting for it to work. This includes a reload of the kvm_intel module, since we don't want to stop and start libvirtd and remove and load the module everytime the state runs we've added a little check and a `prereq` so the check is only in one place.

This `prereq` however causes 'some' other states to run in test=True mode too. The `stop_libvirt` state is also affected. They never get exectued and cause other states to fail.

I don't know why this is happening but I suspect it has something todo with with how the `prereq` gets executed and the test=True handling of state.py (line: 1643, 1708). And again not all future states are affected only some states like `pkg.installed` even though they should be exectuted normally, without tets=True.

Test state:

With the following state file you can reproduce the bug. You should see, that `qemu-kvm: pkg.installed` will be executed with test=True set.

For that to happen you have to install a package, then have a state with prereq and then install another package, that's why I have arranged the states as they are now.

``` sls

    - installed

libvirt-python:

stop_libvirt:
  service.dead:

      - kmod: rmmod_kvm_intel

rmmod_kvm_intel:
  kmod.absent:
    - name: kvm_intel
    - onlyif:
      - grep N '/sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested'

/etc/modprobe.d/dist.conf:
  file.managed:

insmod_kvm_intel:
  kmod.present:

start_libvirtd:
  service.running:
    - name: libvirtd
    - enable: True

qemu-kvm:
