### Description of Issue/Question
When installing multiple package at once with `pkgs` option of state `pkg.installed`, weird things are occuring...
If using wildcards (`*` characters), packages are not installed, and when not using wildcards, packages are installed, but state fails.

### Setup
Make a state like this:
```yaml
httpd_installed:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - httpd: '2.4.6*'
      - httpd-tools: '2.4.6*'
```

Or, for second case:
```yaml
httpd_installed:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - httpd: '2.4.6'
      - httpd-tools: '2.4.6'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
When using such state:
```yaml
httpd_installed:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - httpd: '2.4.6*'
      - httpd-tools: '2.4.6*'
```
The execution failed and the packages are not installed:
```yaml
minion2:
----------
          ID: httpd_installed
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: Error occurred installing package(s). Additional info follows:

              errors:
                  - No version matching '2.4.6*' found for package 'httpd' (available: none)
                  - No version matching '2.4.6*' found for package 'httpd-tools' (available: none)

Summary for minion2
------------

------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:   5.276 s
```

If I use no wildcard in versions, it fails equally, but packages are installed:
```yaml
minion2:
----------
          ID: httpd_installed
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: httpd=2.4.6, httpd-tools=2.4.6

     Changes:
              ----------
              httpd:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      2.4.6-45.el7.centos.4
                  old:
              httpd-tools:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      2.4.6-45.el7.centos.4
                  old:

Summary for minion2
------------
Succeeded: 0 (changed=1)
Failed:    1
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:  15.054 s
```

But if the packages are installed on the minion, the state failed when not using wildcards and succeed when using them.
