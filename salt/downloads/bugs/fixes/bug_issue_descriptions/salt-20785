The `gitpython` GitFS backend (others possibly too, haven't tested the `pygit` and `dulwich` backends) doesn't delete branches which have been removed from the remote in the master's cache.

```
salt-run cache.clear_all
salt-run fileserver.update
salt-run fileserver.envs sources=True
```

â€¦ still shows old branches/environments which have been deleted long ago from the remote.
This has caused quite some trouble here because I unexpectedly ran into topfile collisions etc and couldn't make sense of it, as my local clone and the remote were both clean of any collisions until I realized it's GitFS not cleaning up.

IMHO, GitFS should always have a clone which 100% reflects the state of the remote.
