### Description of Issue
Original problem started out as file.managed with content_pillar throwing an error. 

`Unable to manage file: endswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str`

with a trace in the debug logs of 

```
[DEBUG   ] Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\states\file.py", line 2747, in managed
    **kwargs)
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\file.py", line 5276, in manage_file
    _splitlines_preserving_trailing_newline(contents))
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\file.py", line 157, in _splitlines_preserving_trailing_newline
    if str.endswith('\n') or str.endswith('\r'):
TypeError: endswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str
```
Which pointed to `file.check_managed_changes` when it was checking the meta of the file. for `pchanges`

This only happens when any kind of binary `contents` is used instead of a source.


### Setup
Quickest setup i found. 

setup [pillar.file_tree](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/pillar/all/salt.pillar.file_tree.html)
```
ext_pillar:
  - file_tree:
      root_dir: /srv/file_tree
      follow_dir_links: False
      keep_newline: False
```

add a windows minion to the master.
Add a binary file to the file_tree pillar for that windows minion that is a binary file named `random.bin`

Use the following state twice. Once to create the binary file. and again to fail.
```
dump_secret:
  file.managed:
    - name: C:/random.bin
    - contents_pillar: 'random.bin'
```

Note under py2 the error is different but looks to be caused by the same inability to handle binary data coming from `contents`
