This problem occurs using salt-cloud out of salt:develop HEAD.
I reproduced this with both - two providers defined in /etc/salt/cloud or two files in /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d.

There needs to be only one profile defined using one of the providers and a map with a single host in it. As long as it is down the map and host can be queried against and started using the -m switch. As soon as the map was started, any action causes the exception below:

```
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[INFO    ] Applying map from '/etc/salt/bug.map'.
[ERROR   ] There was an error with a custom map: 'bug-1'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jenkins/sources/salt.HEAD/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 134, in run
query=self.selected_query_option
  File "/home/jenkins/sources/salt.HEAD/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1052, in interpolated_map
  names.remove(vm_name)
KeyError: 'bug-1'
```

To reproduce this, one can simply use an existing provider/profile/map configuration and duplicate the provider under a new name
