Trying to utilize `artifactory.downloaded` to deploy an assembly artifact to a minion. I've placed a copy of an example along with steps I've taken to try and diagnose at https://gist.github.com/jbouse/bd5260e2a7635867f973 including `salt --versions-report` output. This is slightly different from #19879 in that I'm not getting the error that artifactory.downloaded is unavailable. Instead I get the following:

```
$ salt minion-id state.sls test
minion-id:
----------
           ID: myco-artifact
     Function: artifactory.downloaded
       Result: False
      Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1563, in call
              self.verify_ret(ret)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 796, in verify_ret
              'Malformed state return, return must be a dict'

      Started: 12:44:50.671013
     Duration: 62.355 ms
```

If I use salt-call and call artifactory.get_snapshot with both version and snapshot_version then I am successful but calling artifactory.downloaded in the state file which is the same as calling with snapshot_version=None fails and there doesn't appear to be anyway to call artifactory.downloaded and pass snapshot_version along as the internal call to artifactory.get_snapshot doesn't pass a snapshot_version parameter.

Calling artifactory.get_snapshot in attempt to duplicate the call from within artifactory.downloaded I get the following traceback:

```
