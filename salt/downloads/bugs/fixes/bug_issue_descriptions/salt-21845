In #19001 `salt/states/pip_state.py` code was changed so that `pip install` would be run even if there is nothing to install.
With pip v1.0 `pip install` returns 1 when run without any arguments:

```
$ pip install
You must give at least one requirement to install (see "pip help install")
Storing complete log in /home/vagrant/.pip/pip.log
$ echo $?
1
```

With pip2 the message is the same but it returns 0:

```
$ pip install
You must give at least one requirement to install (see "pip help install")
$ echo $?
0
```

state.sls:

```
python-gnupg:
  pip.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: python-pip

python-pip:
  pkg.installed
```

Result:

Adding `- ignore_installed: True` to the pip state will make the package install, but then it is installed during every highstate call.
