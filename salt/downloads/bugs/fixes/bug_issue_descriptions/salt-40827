Hi,

For example, the default `nginx.conf` on Ubuntu comes with this:

```
        # multi_accept on;
```

That's a tab character before the hash character. It causes this:

```
multi_accept enable:
  file.uncomment:
    - name: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    - regex: multi_accept on;
```

to fail with this:

```
----------
          ID: multi_accept enable
    Function: file.uncomment
        Name: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      Result: False
     Comment: Expected uncommented lines not found
     Started: 18:41:01.049725
    Duration: 2.051 ms
     Changes:
```

The solution would be to ignore but preserve all whitespace before the comment character.
