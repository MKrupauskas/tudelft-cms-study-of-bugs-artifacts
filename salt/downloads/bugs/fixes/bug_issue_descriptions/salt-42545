### Description
Calls to Salt-API return False for minions attached to master via a syndic.
If the minion is directly connected to teh same master running salt-api full results will be returned.
If the minion is connected via a syndic the returned results with be "false" no further information provided.

The ability to query the estate via the api is damn useful for collecting and validating information about my estate.
Given minion 2017.07.0 doesn't work with older masters I either loose new features or loose the API.

### Setup
I have a "Global Master" managing 2 Salt Syndics. Of these syndics I have multiple salt minions connected (70 to one and 50 to another, constantly growing.)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Issue a call via salt-api to retrieve information about a minion that is not directly connected to this salt master but is connected via a syndic.

example
{
        "client": "local",
        "tgt": "*",
        "fun": "test.ping",
        "username": "USER",
        "password": "password",
        "expr_form": "list",
        "eauth": "pam"
    }

Will return
{
    "return": [
        {
            "BOX1": true
            "BOX2": false
            "BOX3": false
        }
    ]
}

I have also been trying grains.items with the same results.

Running the command via the CLI works correctly
"salt '*' test.ping"
Just via salt-api returns incorrect information.
