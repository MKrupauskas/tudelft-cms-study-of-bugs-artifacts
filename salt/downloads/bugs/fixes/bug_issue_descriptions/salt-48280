### Description of Issue/Question

I use glusterfs, which is a network filesystem. Sometimes I mount a glusterfs volume read/write at one mountpoint, and read-only at another mountpoint. But the `mount.mounted` state doesn't let me do this.

When this state is used, the application of the second mountpoint removes the first one. I can't find a way through the other options of `mount.mounted` to have both coexist. 

### Setup

Sls state file:

```
/mnt/realm:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: core00:/realm2
    - fstype: glusterfs
    - mkmnt: True
    - require:
      - pkg: glusterfs-client

/mnt/realmro:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: core00:/realm2
    - fstype: glusterfs
    - mkmnt: True
    - opts: ro
    - require:
      - pkg: glusterfs-client
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1) Apply the above state
2) Observe that only one mount is created, and each time they overwrite eachother
