I'm currently working on setting up a new minion (on Vagrant). After a while the communication between minion / master suddenly became problematic.

Executing `salt-call state.show_top` from the minion shows nothing. In trace-mode I see it is loading its key and then.. nothing.

Serverside (in trace mode) it shows authentication requests/accepted.. Rendering some pillars, all file no errors. 

And then nothing. Sometimes it shows `AES payload received with command _file_list` and "Updating fileserver cache". 

Specs:

```
           Salt: 2014.1.7
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.3.0
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 14.0.1
            ZMQ: 4.0.4
```

On Vagrant, Virtualbox with Ubuntu 14.04.1.

Is there any way to see **what** it's actually doing?
