On salt version 2014.7.0 git_pillar silently fails when running in masterless mode.  Turns out it just exits the ext_pillar method if pillar_dirs argument is not defined. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/pillar/git_pillar.py#L230

Not sure what the best approach to fixing this is.  As a temporary fix I have simply redefined pillar_dirs to be an empty dictionary on line 231 and so far I haven't seen any undesirable side effects.  More than likely I am missing the point of the pillar_dirs argument and there is a very good reason for the current implementation?
