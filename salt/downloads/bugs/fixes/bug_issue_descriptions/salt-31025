We're seeing this error on any salt run on Ubuntu 12.04 with the system pip package (python-pip_1.0-1build1) installed.

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to import states pip_state, this is due most likely to a syntax error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1135, in _load_module
   ), fn_, fpath, desc)
 File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/pip_state.py", line 51, in <module>
   ver = pip.__version__.split('.')
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__version__'
```

Unlike later versions of pip, version 1.0 doesn't have a version string:

```
$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Jun 22 2015, 19:33:41)
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import pip
>>> pip.__version__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__version__'
```

It's probably best to wrap the `pip.__version__` check in salt/states/pip_state.py in a `hasattr` call. Incidentally, the version check in that module appears to be duplicated.
