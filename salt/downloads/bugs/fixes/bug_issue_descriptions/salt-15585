Hi, 
My state contains:

```
mongodb_repo:
   pkgrepo.managed:
      - comments: foo bar baz
      - name: deb http://12.10.0.30/pkgs/ debian/
```

After running this states `/etc/apt/source.list`has a new entry:

```
   deb http://12.10.0.30/pkgs/ debian/ #f 
```

So only the first letter of the comment is copied. 
This is probably a minor issue to fix.

Thanks, 
Oz
