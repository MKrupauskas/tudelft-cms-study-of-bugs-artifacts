When trying to install the yum package memcached using

memcached:
  pkg:
    - installed

It fails to install, the debug log on the client shows the following error

Install failed: Cannot retrieve metalink for repository: epel/x86_64. Please verify its path and try again

Installing it manually via yum install memcached works correctly.
This is a Linux Amazon AMI, with salt installed today using the following command

wget -O - http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh

Is there a path or something that needs to be modified for this to work on an Amazon AMI?

Thanks (in advance)
