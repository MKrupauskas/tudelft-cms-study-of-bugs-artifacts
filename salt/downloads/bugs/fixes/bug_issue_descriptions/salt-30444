Running salt 2015.8.3. I think when a machine is cloned with Linode, the config is automatically configured based off of the existing machine. So when salt attempts to create a new disk config, it gets the following response:

```
{u'ACTION': u'linode.disk.createfromdistribution', u'DATA': {}, u'ERRORARRAY': [{u'ERRORCODE': 8, u'ERRORMESSAGE': u'You do not have enough unallocated storage to create this Disk (24448 requested, but only 0 available)'}]}
```

and throws the following exception:

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to create VM prd-core-cache4. Configuration value 'DiskID' needs to be set
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1249, in create
    output = self.clouds[func](vm_)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/linode.py", line 444, in create
    root_disk_id = create_disk_from_distro(vm_, node_id)['DiskID']
KeyError: 'DiskID'

```

It might be necessary to list the configs when cloning instead of trying to create a new config. I don't think deleting the existing config is an option, because the linode utilities use that to migrate the disk from the cloned node.
