It appears that Salt 2015.8.1 from repo.saltstack org is pulling two dependencies from that repo that are overwriting the Base CentOS repo.  PyYAML 3.10 and python-crypto 2.0.1 are being replaced.

Also, openpgm 5.2.122 and python-zmq from EPEL are being replaced as well with later versions.

This is NOT a good practice.  Please don't replace base/system versions of files.  If the newer version is absolutely necessary, package it for parallel install with a different package name and leave the base packages alone.  I would rather see Salt 2015.8 packaged and released on EPEL since I can be confident that nothing there will overwrite base packages.  Until this is resolved I will remain on 2015.5.5.
