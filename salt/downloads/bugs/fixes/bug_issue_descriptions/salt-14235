On Ubuntu 12.04, the `rabbitmq-plugins` command is kept in `/usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-2.7.1/sbin` instead of the usual `$PATH` locations. I've tried symlinking, but that doesn't work either.

I see two possible solutions:
1. Hardcode the `sbin` path on the respective distributions.
2. Introduce/document a way to export the correct directory into the `$PATH` variable for the duration of the command inside the script definition.

I think 1 is the easiest to implement now, and it masks the OS implementation from the Salt user.
