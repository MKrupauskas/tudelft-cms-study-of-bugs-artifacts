Per https://groups.google.com/d/msg/salt-users/RhSjWJYMOOo/33L4TgzLAgAJ, running pkg.uptodate is not stateful (it returns blue output even when nothing is actually upgraded), but it should be comparing before and after state and only reporting changes if something changed.  For example:

```
      Result: True
     Comment: Upgrade successful.
     Changes:
              ----------
              changes:
                  ----------
              comment:
              result:
                  True
```
