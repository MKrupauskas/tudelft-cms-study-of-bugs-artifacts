I met the problem too. many minions works well, only one hangs, and minion hog cpu to 100%

After starting the salt minion, it auto scheduled mine.update, and the cpu went 100%
I can avoid this by tuning multiprocessing to false, and everything works fine.

I straced minion, it was busy epoll_wait, which returned 1.
" SaltReqTimeoutError: Waited 60 seconds" was logged, I thought it was throwed from sign_in

Tried publish command from the master, minion did excute the job, but nothing returned to master.
tcpdump the 4506 port returns nothing

master and minion has the same version:
