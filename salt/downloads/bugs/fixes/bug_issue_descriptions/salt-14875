In https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/472f982dd39495ab45183aac1ba713acb1e0edad s0undt3ch added some code to compare tuples for the required libcloud version.

Somehow these two lines of code, are living in the develop branch, but not in the latest 2014.1.10 tag or any of the 2014.1.x tags.

```
    if tuple(version) >= reqver:
        return libcloud.__version__
```

In the latest tagged version https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.1.10/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py, the code looks as follows:

```
    comps = ver.split('.')
    version = []
    for number in comps[:3]:
        version.append(int(number))
    errormsg = 'Your version of libcloud is {0}. '.format(libcloud.__version__)
    errormsg += 'salt-cloud requires >= libcloud {0}'.format(required_version)
```

The comparison is missing and hence the code always fails. Despite having libcloud installed with the correct version, I actually received the following error message:

```
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/cloud/clouds/openstack.py", line 520, in __query_node_data
    check_libcloud_version('0.14.0', why='rackconnect: True')
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 68, in check_libcloud_version
    raise ImportError(errormsg)
ImportError: Your version of libcloud is 0.14.0. salt-cloud requires >= libcloud ['0', '.', '1', '4', '.', '0'] for rackconnect: True. Please upgrade.
```

I am having trouble finding were those 2 lines with the actual comparison of the tuple got lost.
The current branch definitely has the correct code:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py#L82

Could you please make sure this gets fixed in the next release as it breaks rackconnect functionality?
