### Description of Issue/Question

Operation of the dnsmasq.set_config module function adds lines to the configuration file which cause failure of dnsmasq.
### Setup

Salt has been installed in a Python virtual environment on a MacBook Pro running OS-X version 10.11.5, using git and a Homebrew current copy of Python, as suggested in [Installing Salt for development](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/development/hacking.html) as adapted for Mac OS. 

Note: the link on that page to the non-development installation for OS-x is not very helpful.

Dnsmasq was installed using Homebrew as suggested in [this blog](https://passingcuriosity.com/2013/dnsmasq-dev-osx/). 

In order for dnsmasq.version and dnsmasq.fullversion to work, I had to add dnsmasq to the PATH, which is not mentioned as a prerequisite, but ought to be:

`$ ln -s /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/sbin/dnsmasq /usr/local/bin`
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

``` (bash)
$ sudo salt-call --local dnsmasq.set_config 'config_file=/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf' domain=local address='/vern.test.local/8.8.4.4'
Password:
local:

        salt-call
    address:
        /vern.test.local/8.8.4.4
    domain:
        local
$ tail /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

# Include all files in a directory which end in .conf
#conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,*.conf
domain=local
__pub_pid=8184
__pub_fun=dnsmasq.set_config
__pub_jid=20160623181002095141
__pub_tgt=salt-call
address=/vern.test.local/8.8.4.4
$ sudo dnsmasq --no-daemon

dnsmasq: bad option at line 681 of /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
```
