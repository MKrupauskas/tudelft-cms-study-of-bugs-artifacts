### Description of Issue/Question

Looking at [`modules/zabbix.py`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/zabbix.py#L45), it looks like it requires that the Salt Master be installed on the same machine as the Zabbix (backend) server. However, the rest of the module seems to only require API access (over HTTP).

Is the `__virtual__()` wrong? Or is there something I'm missing?
