I have noticed that logging is not working inside modules on a windows-minion.

I have tried to add a simple log.debug("foobar") in 

```
 - win_pkg.py
def install(name=None, refresh=False, **kwargs):
    log.debug("foobar")
```

to have it print out some random debugging info. but when i run the function from my master nothing is printed on the windows minion.

I have tried to do the same thing but in another module on a ubuntu minion and that works perfect with the same code but in the test.ping module for example.

When i start my windows-minion i set logging level to all and i can still see output like

```
[TRACE   ] Added data.load to module
[DEBUG   ] Loaded win_service as virtual service
[INFO    ] User root Executing command pkg.install with jid
```

but no output from modules is shown.

I use the latest development on both master and minion and running on win8 and ubuntu 12.04 LTS
