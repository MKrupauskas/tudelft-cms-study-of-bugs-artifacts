While debugging a py state I noticed my debug output occurring twice. Testing was done as "salt state.sls teststate". To confirm this I stripped it down to:

```
#!py

def run():
  print "here"
```

I saw "here" printed twice. To test this even further I ran:

```
#!py
from random import randint
def run():
  x = randint(2,9)
  print x
```

The output was "4" and "3" which means randint did indeed get ran twice. This makes it unusable for me as the state I am creating will be doing a significant amount of work and should not be ran twice every on every single salt call.
