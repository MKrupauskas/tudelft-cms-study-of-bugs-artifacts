I'm standing up a salt master via salt ssh.  My process is as follows:
- Use salt-ssh salt.master to install salt-master service on the target
- Checkout my states and pillar data from git into `/srv/salt` and `/srv/pillar` on the target

Problem is, once I populate /srv/pillar from git, that data starts getting merged into the local pillar data I've supplied from salt-ssh.  All further calls from salt-ssh get pillar data I did not intend to be used during salt-ssh calls.  Is this expected?  Is there any way I can tell salt-ssh calls to ignore the contents of /srv/pillar on the target?

As an example, I have an `sshd_config` pillar item for use with the openssh formula under /srv/pillar on my local machine (the machine I run salt-ssh on).  In my git repo that gets checked out into /srv/pillar on the target, I have a different `sshd_config` that I intend to be applied to all minions this master will manage.  However, once that git repo has been checked out, its `sshd_config` pillar item starts getting applied whenever I call `salt-ssh '*' state.highstate` instead of the pillar item defined on my local machine.
