When upgrading Windows 7 Minion from any of:
2014.7.1
2014.7.2
2014.7.5
2015.5.0

A silent install stops and uninstalls the old minion, installs 2015.5.1 but then does not start the service.  This was tested as an upgrade and as a fresh install.

Also the /S (silent) is no longer silent.  Several cmd.exe windows (net.exe, icacls.exe) pop up on the screen for a split second and then disappear.  I recorded it and played it back frame by frame and there was no content in the window but they did pop up.

Manually starting the service works after the silent install finishes (i.e. no errors).

A manual (typical double click install file) install works as expected (service starts when install finishes).
