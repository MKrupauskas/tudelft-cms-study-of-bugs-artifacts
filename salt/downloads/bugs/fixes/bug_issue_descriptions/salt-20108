I noticed a useful new feature in 2014.7.0 (don't think it was there earlier) where for a JID there was a 'Minions' list populated with all hosts expected to reply based on the compound match target. This is great for comparing if a job is actually done VS looking done and a very welcome feature!

Unfortunately I've noticed when testing master_job_cache = redis there is no 'Minions' field when doing a jobs.print_job like there is with the local disk cache. My assumption here is that the same data is available to populate the Redis key for the job, and it slipped through the cracks perhaps?

As it stands I'm stuck between a lesser overhead, more flexible data store VS being able to evaluate jobs with the same granularity. I want my cake and to eat it too :) Is that a known issue?

Thanks!
