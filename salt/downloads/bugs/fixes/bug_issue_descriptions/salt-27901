Found during debug, currently isn't visible externally, but wrong by design.
--pillar command line argument sets 'pillar' key to True or False in self.config via self.defaults that is used as a loader argument where opts data expected. If opts contains 'pillar' it expects it to be a dict object containing pillar data, not bool.

The easiest way to fix is to set another target for --pillar command line, for instance 'use_pillar' instead of 'pillar'.
