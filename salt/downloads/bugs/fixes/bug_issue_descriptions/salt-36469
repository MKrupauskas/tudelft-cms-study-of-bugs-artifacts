### Description of Issue/Question

Sending large payloads the salt-master appears to drop jobs (or never send them).
### Setup

Tested on 2015.8 one master one minion. Apologies for testing against an older rev. I don't have the bandwidth right now to test against latest. My hope is someone out there can run the gist against latest and see if its still an issue. I mainly wanted to get this on the radar to confirm that is not just me. Env is easy enough, one master, one minion with the test + cmd module enabled.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Script I use to trigger issue is in the gist link below. It floods a master with small jobs + some jumbo ones. Idea here is tail the minion log. Wait for the all the jobs to go through (ie look for the log to settle). Then press a key to clear the script, it will then auto grep the minion log to see if JID's published are missing from the minion under test.

You may need to play with the run count and payload size. I suspect that the issue is related to this area of the code https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/transport/zeromq.py#L812
My basic theory is that the PUSH socket is being garbage collected since linger is net set on exit of the scope. (For ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6702187/python-zeromq-push-pull-lost-messages) I tried a small refactor that moved the PUSH socket creation out of the publish function and into the init of the class... but I still get dropped messages.
