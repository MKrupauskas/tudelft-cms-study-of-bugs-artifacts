2015.8 exhibits a problem wherein the number of open file-handles increases by a minimum of three handles on each publication sent from the salt-master.

To replicate:

1) Set up a salt-master and salt-minion at the head of 2015.8.
2) In another terminal, run the following command: `lsof|egrep master_event| wc -l`
3) Send a single publication, i.e. `salt <my_minion> test.echo 'Hello world'`
4) Observe that the number of open file handles in step 2 increases.

This behaviour does not occur in 2015.5. This was likely introduced in PR #24612.
