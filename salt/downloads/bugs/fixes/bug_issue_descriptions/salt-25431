Hello,

I came across with an issue with Digital Ocean's API request limit and had modified the code a bit.

I've added to following to each query.
- '&per_page=200'

I'm currently on 2015.5.2 and modified following lines on v2.py file.
line: 115 items = query(method='images', command='?page=' + str(page) + '&per_page=200')

line: 165 items = query(method='droplets', command='?page=' + str(page) + '&per_page=200')

line: 197 items = query(method='droplets', command='?page=' + str(page) + '&per_page=200')

I believe each page has 20 items by default, but making it 200 or whichever # you like will help reducing the # of API calls.

Maybe someone else can modify this to better way.

Just wanted to share.
