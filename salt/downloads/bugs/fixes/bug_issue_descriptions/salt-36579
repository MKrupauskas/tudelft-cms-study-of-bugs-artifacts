### Description of Issue/Question

Ref https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/36114, since I am still having issues with some scheduled jobs returning data that the reactor sls file files to render (json->yaml->json issue) and I realized you can write reactor files in pure python, I decided to redo my returner/reactor/runner implementation shown in that issue so the reactor is python.

When trying to test the new reactor, the name of the reactor changed from scheduled-job-return-reactor.sls to scheduled-job-return-reactor.py (change in file extension) and I removed the old file (I since realized I did not need to change the file extension, old habits).  However I forgot to update the master config to direct the event to the new reactor file so it still listed the old file name which no longer exists.

Turns out no errors are generated when the reactor config references a file that does not exist.  Instead all that I see is

```
2016-09-26 18:54:10,829 [salt.utils.event ][DEBUG   ][24493] Sending event - data = {'_stamp': '2016-09-26T18:54:10.829168', ...}
2016-09-26 18:54:10,831 [salt.utils.reactor][DEBUG   ][24493] Gathering reactors for tag scheduled-job-return
2016-09-26 18:54:10,831 [salt.utils.reactor][DEBUG   ][24493] Compiling reactions for tag scheduled-job-return
```

but the reactor never runs.  I eventually figured out that interspersed with lots of unrelated stuff in the log there is a sequence of these messages from the same thread

```
2016-09-26 19:08:27,988 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
2016-09-26 19:08:32,992 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
2016-09-26 19:08:37,993 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
2016-09-26 19:08:42,996 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
2016-09-26 19:08:47,998 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
2016-09-26 19:08:53,003 [salt.utils.event ][TRACE   ][24493] _get_event() waited 5000 seconds and received nothing
```

That made me reexamine everything more closely and I finally realized the issue was the reactor file name was wrong in the reactor config for the master.  This condition should produce an error.
