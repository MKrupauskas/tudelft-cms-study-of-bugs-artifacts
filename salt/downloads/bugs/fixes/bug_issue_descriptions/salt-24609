I often get this error, when targeting all the minions, like `salt \* saltutil.sync_grains`

```
[ERROR   ] Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased.
```

I am running salt-master on a host with 4 cores and 8GB of RAM, and the worker_threads were initially 16. I increased it to 32 and still get that error. My master and minions are 2014.7.5. Also after I get that error all the cores stay at 100% usage for a minute or two. We have about a 1000 minions.
