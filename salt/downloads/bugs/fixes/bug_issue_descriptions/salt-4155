I had a git repo update with a large # of changes.

git exited with a warning: git.latest: warning: too many files (created: 2765 deleted: 152), skipping inexact rename detection

The repository updated fine, with a warning, but git.latest counted it as a failure. Because it wasn't a return code 0, even though it updated code, my cmd.wait that was watching the git.latest failed to kick off.

Should we count this warning as a success?
