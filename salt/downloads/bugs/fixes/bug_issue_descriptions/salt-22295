I am trying to test the new yubico auth in 2015.2.0rc1.

I am getting this error.

```

If you were trying to pass additional data to be used in a template context, please populate 'context' with 'key: value' pairs.

eedgar@saltmaster-dev:~$ salt --log-file=/dev/null -a yubico '*' test.ping
username: eedgar
password:
Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
