I managed to track this bug back through to the source, but I'm just about to head to bed.

PR #28737 changed things to use a new `mysql.db_get` function, which would be nice except it doesn't work properly.  I'm guessing there aren't any test cases that cover this particular quirk.
It gets the database info with this query:

``` sql
SELECT DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME, DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA
 WHERE SCHEMA_NAME='name';
```

That's fine, but the database name has `_` replaced with `\_`, which in this context is wrong.  I'd guess the same applies to `%` becoming `\%` but I'm not 100% sure on that (no pun intended lol) so confirmation would be good.

If someone can throw a quick fix at it that would be ace, I'll try to find some time tomorrow if not.
