I'm trying to run salt-master as unprivileged user on a shared hosting server, in my home directory. There is a problem with permission traversal check starting the master:

```
SaltClientError: Could not access /home. Please give myuser read permissions.
```

and it's expected because `ll -d /home` gives:

```
drwxr-x--x 280 root root 12288 10 apr 02:37 /home
```

But I'd rather expect it shouldn't be a problem because `/home/myuser` is read/write to myuser. Nevertheless the master doesn't start and I have to stop the exception keep looping with ctrl c.

I can't change /home permissions. Any workaround? Maybe it's possible to disable traversal check? 

Issue details:

``` console
$ cat ~/local/etc/salt/master
# ...other config...
user: myuser
root_dir: /home/myuser/local
