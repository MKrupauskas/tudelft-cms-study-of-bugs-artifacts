### Description of Issue/Question
win_lgpo does not properly pack the group policy version number after incrementing the values when a user or group policy value is greater than 16384, which will cause a failure on the subsequent attempt of win_lgpo to increment the value (gpedit.msc can be used to properly reset the value as a workaround, but any subsequent changes by win_lgpo will put an invalid version number in the file)

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Attempt to apply a policy when a Machine/User policy number larger than 16384.  If win_lgpo sets the policy, an invalid version number will be set into the gpt.ini file which will cause subsequent attempts by win_lgpo to set a policy to fail.
