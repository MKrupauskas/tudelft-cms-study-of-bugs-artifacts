I'm running the latest develop on CentOS 5.

I noticed that the pkg.installed state was failing. I did some more poking around and realized that the pkg.install execution module is not working. Here's my salt-call output:

```

Here's my versions info:

```
[root@ip-172-31-8-176 ~]# salt-call test.versions_report

```

Having zmq 2.1.9 doesn't seem to be causing this issue. I'm getting this even when running salt-call.
