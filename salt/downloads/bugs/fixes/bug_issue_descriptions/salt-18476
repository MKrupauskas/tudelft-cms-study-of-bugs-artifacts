I don't know exactly where to report this or put it, but we can go from here. 

System: Ubuntu 14.04
PPA: Saltstack and Chris-Lea/zeromq

I did a normal upgrade and upgraded my saltstack via apt-get. The upgrade went okay, but I was unable to run salt commands correctly. It kept on throwing issues because it could not find the correct zmq. pyzmq was installed correctly.

I found out the version was incorrect. I had to back out my pyzmq package from Ubuntu and push in the correct package from pypi. 

I would consider this a low issue as there are workarounds.
