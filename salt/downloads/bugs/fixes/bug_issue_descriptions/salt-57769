**Description**
postgres.datadir_init does not create an external WAL directory when requested via the "waldir" parameter - the "waldir" parameter is not passed through to _run_initdb(): https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/postgres.py#L3596

**Setup**
no special setup neccessary

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
look at the code and it's obvious

**Expected behavior**
pass the given parameters

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Versions Report**
Support for "waldir" and "checksums" parameters to datadir_init() was added in 2019.2 but both parameters were not passed through to _run_initdb() (which makes me wonder if I screwed up back then or if there was some merge disaster?). The "checksums" parameter has been fixed in commit 35e2cacac6e4dfe21208434b2dea295c62561e9e but "waldir" has once again been missed, so here we go.
