I created couple new servers today and noticed that the output of the mine function I use for getting  the ip address of the minion is returning in a different format.    I can find documentation about the change in format for defining a mine function, but nothing noting the difference in output.

Am I overlooking something?

### Set
mine function definition (via pillar):
```
mine_functions:
  internal_ip:
    - mine_function: grains.get
    - fqdn_ip4
  internal_ips:
    - mine_function: grains.get
    - ipv4
```

command to get mine data:
```
salt saltmaster mine.get '*' internal_ip
```
expected output:
```
    minion_name:
        - 10.1.2.3
```
received output:
```
    minion_name:
        ----------
        __data__:
            - 10.1.2.3
        __saltmine_acl__:
            1
```

When used in a jinja template I receive an error that there is not an element 0
```
{% for server, addr in salt['mine.get'](match, 'internal_ip', tgt_type='compound').items() | sort(case_sensitive=False) -%}
{{ host }}     IN    A   {{ addr[0] }}
{% endfor -%}
```
```
