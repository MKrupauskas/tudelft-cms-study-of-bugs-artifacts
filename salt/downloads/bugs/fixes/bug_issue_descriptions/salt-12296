If the file minion_id begins with a BOM (byte-order mark, FF FE in hex bytes) as is the default for Windows unicode file writing, when the minion tries to authenticate with the master it will cause the master to hang, requiring a restart.

The following messages are typical of what appears in the master log:

```
2014-04-25 17:29:43,104 [salt.master][INFO] Authentication request from web014
2014-04-25 17:29:44,152 [salt.master][INFO] Authentication request from web013
2014-04-25 17:40:11,787 [salt.master][INFO] Authentication request from web011
2014-04-25 17:40:12,866 [salt.master][INFO] Authentication request from web012
2014-04-25 17:40:13,116 [salt.master][INFO] Authentication request from web014
```

Note that the master hangs immediately after this log message.

The bug can be reproduced (using minion and master version 2014.1.3) by doing the following in Powershell on the minion:

```
PS> $($env:COMPUTERNAME).toLower() > C:\salt\conf\minion_id
PS> Restart-Service salt-minion
```

This will cause the master to hang.

Workaround is to ensure minion_id is ASCII:

```
PS> $($env:COMPUTERNAME).toLower() |Out-File -Encoding "ASCII" C:\salt\conf\minion_id
```
