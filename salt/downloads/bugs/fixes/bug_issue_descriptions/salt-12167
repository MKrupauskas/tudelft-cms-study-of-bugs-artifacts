I've upgraded some of our Windows based 2014.1.0 and 2014.1.1 minions to 2014.1.3 from the following site using the Salt-Minion-2014.1.3-AMD64-Setup.exe installer:
http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/windows.html

When doing so, the installer does not honor the master IP given to it during the install.  I've tried with the /S /m=IPADDRESS and during the GUI install.  The c:\salt\conf\minion file always contains master: salt on all of the servers I've tried.  I also tried a fresh install with the same result.  

Also, the carriage returns are no longer the same in the minion conf file.  I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, except that it's corrupt on every install/upgrade I've done so far.  So, even if I manually replace master: salt with master: MYIPADDRESS and restart the salt-minion service, it never talks to the salt master.  If I manually copy a minion file from a previous install and restart the salt-minion service, everything works fine again.
