Adding schedules to a Windows minion succeeds, but a restart of the minion comes up with an empty schedule list.

The log says:

```
[salt.utils.schedule][ERROR   ][10528] Failed to persist the updated schedule
```

The reason is straightforward I think. Here is the code snippet from utils/schedule.py that is producing the log entry:

```
def persist(self):
    '''
    Persist the modified schedule into <<configdir>>/minion.d/_schedule.conf
    '''
    schedule_conf = os.path.join(
            salt.syspaths.CONFIG_DIR,
            'minion.d',
            '_schedule.conf')
    log.debug('Persisting schedule')
    try:
        with salt.utils.fopen(schedule_conf, 'wb+') as fp_:
            fp_.write(yaml.dump({'schedule': self.opts['schedule']}))
    except (IOError, OSError):
        log.error('Failed to persist the updated schedule')
```

The problem is, that the target directory `minion.d` was not created by the installer. After manually creating the directory and reapplication of the schedule, the issue was gone, schedules were successfully persisted and immediately available after restart of the minion.

Please fix the minion installer.

Used minion installer: Salt-Minion-2015.8.4-AMD64-Setup.exe
