I found a problem setting up a PPA repository, which I resolved by reverting commit a1bcf971.  The problem showed up with the following state:

```
zfs_ppa:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - ppa: zfs-native/stable
```

which errors out like so:

```
----------
[ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1278, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/pkgrepo.py", line 233, in managed
    sanitizedkwargs = __salt__['pkg.expand_repo_def'](kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/apt.py", line 1295, in expand_repo_def
    repo = _strip_uri(repokwargs['repo'])
----------
```

Specifically in this case, `repokwargs` doesn't contain a `repo` key:

```
{
    'ppa': 'zfs-native/stable',
    'state': 'pkgrepo',
    '__id__': 'zfs_ppa',
    'fun': 'managed',
    '__env__': 'base',
    '__sls__': 'zfs',
    'order': 10005
}
```

Happy Thanksgiving; thanks for making Salt!  :)
