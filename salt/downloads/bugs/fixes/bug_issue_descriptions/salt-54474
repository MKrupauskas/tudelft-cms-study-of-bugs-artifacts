### Description of Issue

Introduced in 2019.2.0, the `virt.pool_delete()` function has a `fast` parameter. There are two issues with this parameter:

* it is inversed with its meaning. `fast=True` actually adds the `libvirt.VIR_STORAGE_POOL_DELETE_ZEROED` flag, that should zero the pool and make the delete operation much slower.

* After investigations, none of the libvirt storage backends actually implements this flag, which means that in all cases the default `virt.pool_delete()` call will raise a libvirt exception like the following one:

> Failed deleting pool: unsupported flags (0x1) in function virStorageBackendDeleteLocal

The proposed solution would be to completely remove the `fast` parameter. In all cases changing this part of the API shouldn't hurt, since defaults don't work at all.
