### Description of Issue

from the docs https://docs.saltstack.com/en/2016.11/ref/states/all/salt.states.service.html :

> By default if a service is triggered to refresh due to a watch statement the service is by default 
> restarted. If the desired behavior is to reload the service, then set the reload value to True:

With the following code I'd expect the service to be restarted as soon as the file `/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf` changes:

```sls
/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://neo4j/neo4j.conf
    - require:
      - pkg: neo4j

neo4j_service:
  service.running:
    - name: neo4j
    - enable: True
    - restart: True
    - watch:
        - file: /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
```

What I get however is the following:

The service gets enabled but is not restarted. It works fine on the second run when the file has changed, i.e. when the service is already enabled and running, it is restarted.
