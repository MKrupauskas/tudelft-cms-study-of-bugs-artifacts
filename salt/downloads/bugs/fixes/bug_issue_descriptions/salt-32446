I tried to get all the connected minions from the master.
There are several ways i can do that, such as "salt-run manage.up" or write a python script use salt.wheel.minions.connected().

But i run a command like below:

```
salt '*' saltutil.wheel minions.connected
```

It seems the minions receive the command and execute, then of course return 'None'.

It confused me that [the document](https://salt.readthedocs.org/en/stable/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.saltutil.html#salt.modules.saltutil.wheel) about "salt.modules.saltutil.wheel" said,  "Execute a wheel module (this function must be run on the master)", and i did run this command on the master.

The version of salt i am using is salt 2015.8.5 (Beryllium).
