### Description of Issue/Question

The data type of NodeState members has changed in libcloud >= 1.0.  In the latest stable (0.20.1), it is an integer, in >= 1.0.0, it is a string.

**0.20.1**
https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/87deb04498ea8bb5068e362810c3d2ab89359b48/libcloud/compute/types.py#L192

In version 1.0.0, it is a string

**1.0.0**
https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/735a786e05590a6a1425bff042e8cd35206579b2/libcloud/compute/types.py#L244

Salt-Cloud, explicitly the node_state function, is expecting an integer.
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0a35106df9b430436493bcab531e500a3d3c04f9/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py#L54

This results in an error:
Failed to execute 'gce.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: 'running', which ultimately affects the deletion of nodes.

For context, here's the [pull request](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/624) in libcloud referencing where the change was made and the discussion behind it.
### Possible Solutions

I see a few options to resolve this.
- libcloud version guard for Salt.  Set a max libcloud version  < 1.0.0, probably around [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0a35106df9b430436493bcab531e500a3d3c04f9/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py#L51)
- Push it on the provider wrappers.  Have each wrapper do their own checks for data type and version
- Have node_state do a data type (kind of a hack) or a version check

The first option is the easiest, of course.  It's also not clear to me the future of node_state, as it's not used in too many places.  Node state is an important concept; rather than a utility function, perhaps we should make it an enum or a class (in libcloud it's a class with defined data members) drivers can directly reference?

Happy to implement the fix but would like some feedback/thoughts before I do.  FYI @erjohnso FYI @tonybaloney
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Install libcloud >=1.0.0
2. pip install -I apache-libcloud==1.0.0-rc2
3. create a cloud node (tested on GCE, but reading the code, looks like ec2 would be affected)
4. Run commands
   1. (delete a node) `salt-cloud -d instance-name` (No machines were found to be destroyed)
   2. (query nodes) `salt-cloud -Q` (no response)
5. With the debug flag set, we see:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2352, in run_parallel_map_providers_query
    cloud.clouds[data['fun']]()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 443, in list_nodes
    'state': node_state(node.state)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 67, in node_state
    return states[id_]
KeyError: 'running' 
```
### Versions Report

All recent salt-cloud versions expect node.state to be an integer
