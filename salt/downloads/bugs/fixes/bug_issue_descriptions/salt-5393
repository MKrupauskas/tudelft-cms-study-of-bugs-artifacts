I don't know where the error is actually being formatted, but after digging it turns out this error:

```
State: - pkg
Name:      baseinstall
Function:  installed
    Result:    False
    Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: <long package list here>. The following packages were already installed: <more packages here>.
    Changes:   
```

Is actually being generated by a missing keyword (clarification edit: a missing entry in the accept_keywords file, not anything within Salt).  The way the comment is phrased gives the impression that the update failed /because/ the packages were already installed, rather than that being a separate bit of status information.

Any thoughts on how this could be made more helpful to the user?  I had to run salt-minion in the foreground to find out what emerge was actually complaining about.
