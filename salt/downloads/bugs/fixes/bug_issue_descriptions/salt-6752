When salt parses CLI arguments to pass to the module execution functions, it passes them through `yaml.safe_load()`. This has the unfortunate side effect of turning a value of `|` into an empty string:

``` python
Python 2.7.5 (default, May 12 2013, 12:00:47)
[GCC 4.8.0 20130502 (prerelease)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import yaml
>>> yaml.safe_load('|')
''
>>>
```

I have a fix prepared for this, and will submit a pull req shortly.
