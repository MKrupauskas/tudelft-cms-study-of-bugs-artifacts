spm install <package> duplicating folders in the /srv/spm/salt dir
1. Set everything up to install a package (create_repo, update_repo, etc.)
2. Run `spm install apache` for example.
3. Go to the /srv/salt/spm dir. In the example above, there are two, nested apache folders `srv/spm/salt/apache/apache/init.sls`

In order to get the state to run user must run `salt '*' state.sls apache.apache`. This works, but probably not the normal expectation for running state files.

Expecting that only one apache folder would get created in the .spm
