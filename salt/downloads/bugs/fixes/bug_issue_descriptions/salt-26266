Hi,

I am trying to setup the unit tests and it keeps getting stuck on pw_user_test.py.  The log says:
`14:56:53,533 [salttesting.unit                        :190 ][DEBUG   ] >>>>> START >>>>> unit.modules.pw_user_test.PwUserTestCase.test_getent
14:57:18,691 [salt.utils                              :26  ][TRACE   ] Trying pysss.getgrouplist for 'root'`

and then iterates through our entire nis based employee list.  It's pretty expensive to do each iteration, effectively 3-4 seconds.  This means it's prohibitive to run.

What is this function used for?  Does it make sense to disable it for our infrastructure or is there a way to limit it to just the local /etc/passwd file or a more cross platform approach for local accounts?
