I wirte some sls to stop about thirty useless service on widnows.
It exec to long that master return:  Minon did not return.
I exec `salt-minion -l info` on minon and can see too many `sc qc` cmd like:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "VSS" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and
Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "W3SVC" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "WebClient" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "WinHttpAutoProxySvc" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "winmgmt" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "WmdmPmSN" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "Wmi" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "WmiApSrv" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'sc qc "WPFFontCache_v0400" 5000' in directory 'C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator'
```

It used about 10 minutes to complet  this `state.highstate -v` cmd.
Then I can use `jobs.lookup_jid` to get the result.They all works well.

How can I avoid 'minion did not return' ?
Is there someway to cut down  the states.service exec time?

saltversion: 2014.1.5
