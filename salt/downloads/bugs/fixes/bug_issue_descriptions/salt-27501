`pkg search` starting from version 1.6.0 defaults to show comments what makes at least `pkg.latest` got broken:

Please, consider checking `pkg` version and adding `-q` if version >= 1.6.0 (`pkg search -q pkg_name`) and please help me fix this until release, as I've got a bunch of my `sls`'s broken =( Would it be sufficient to just add `-q` into `cmd` definition in function `latest_version` in `python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/pkgng.py`?
