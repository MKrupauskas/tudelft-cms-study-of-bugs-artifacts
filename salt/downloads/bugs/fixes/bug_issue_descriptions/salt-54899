### Description of Issue
Trying to execute salt module chocolatey to list installed packages on Windows minions.

`salt -G 'os:Windows' chocolatey.list local_only=True`

Minions never return anything, I just get [No Reponse] on master.

If I run

`salt-call --local chocolatey.list local_only=True`

on the minion itself, I get expected output, which is the list of chocolatey packages currently installed on the minion.

### Setup
There is nothing particular about my setup. I have a master running on Ubuntu 18.04 (Py3) and two Windows minions, Server 2016 and Server 2019.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
As per above

`salt -G 'os:Windows' chocolatey.list local_only=True`

### Versions Report
Master and minions both running latest 2019.2.1
