### Description of Issue/Question
The provided example of the locale state output's an error on 2018 version of salt.

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to decode stdout from command [u'locale', u'-a'], non-decodable characters have been replaced
local:
----------
          ID: generate-locale
    Function: locale.present
        Name: en_US.UTF-8
      Result: True
     Comment: Locale en_US.UTF-8 is already present

          ID: set-locale
    Function: locale.system
        Name: en_US.UTF-8
      Result: True
     Comment: System locale en_US.UTF-8 already set
     Started: 14:53:41.913166
    Duration: 32.42 ms
     Changes:

Summary for local
------------

```

But the state seem to have worked fine.

Same state does work flawless on 2017.7 minions/master

### Setup
Pretty much the same setup as the example in:
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.locale.html
```
generate-locale:
  locale.present:
    - name: en_US.UTF-8

set-locale:
  locale.system:
    - name: en_US.UTF-8
    - require:
      - locale: generate-locale
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just create a state in a 2018 version of salt with the setup above (or from the example).
