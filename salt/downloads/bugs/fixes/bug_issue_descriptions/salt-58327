**Description**
On certain systems, win32pdh.CollectQueryData can raise pywintypes.error with `No data to return.` (observed recently on 2008 R2), which is not handled by the `win_pdh` module, this then causes status beacon to fail.

**Setup**
Configure status beacon as described on https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/beacons/all/salt.beacons.status.html

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Have "specifically" configured Windows Server OS (no idea what's the exact cause in Win internal).

**Expected behavior**
Beacon doesn't raise exception, returns no counters for loadavg.

**Versions Report**
v2019.2.5 on `Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard`, although the win_pdh module hasn't changed between 2019.2 and current version
