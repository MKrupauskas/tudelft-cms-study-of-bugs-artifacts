Am I missing something or was the support for `__env__` keyword dropped in 2015.8.0? This was a great feature, allowing to spawn arbitrarily named branches in Git and have their Pillar data completely isolated from production and other branches.

I couldn't come up with such a configuration that would use pillar data from the same branch as file (sls) data. The 'environment' minion option is ignored and every minion pulls pillar data from the 'master' branch.

My temporary solution was reverting back to legacy ext_pillar schema, but I fear this will get unsupported too, eventually. Is there a way to mimic this behavior in 2015.8 or was it removed by purpose?

Thaks a lot.
