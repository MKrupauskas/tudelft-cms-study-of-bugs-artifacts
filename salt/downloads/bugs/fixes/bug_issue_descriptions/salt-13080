Hi,

I've been seeing an issue when I target many minions with state runs, where the output on the master indicates that there are pillar issues with various minions.  The issues it reports are old, and no longer in place in the pillar files themselves.  I've tried saltutil.refresh_pillar from the master, and killing off the /var/cache/salt directory on the minions themselves followed by a restart of salt-minion to no avail.   As a last resort, I also tried deleting /var/cache/salt/master on the master followed by a restart of salt-master, which hasn't worked either.  Any ideas what could be causing this?

```
salt -E ^ln.* state.sls states.monitoring.diskspace
...
...
minion01:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering SLS 'environments.live.web.django-sites.beta' failed, render error:

              - 'file:  /root/.pypirc file for dj ... 
                 ^
```

Again, these are pillar issues that did exist at one time, but have been fixed.  Running 'salt-call pillar.data' on the minions themselves show proper pillar rendering.
