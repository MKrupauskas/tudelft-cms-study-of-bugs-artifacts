**Description**
I have several entries such as  "user: sdb://services/service_account"  in my /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/   files 
example: 

```
Austin:
  driver: vmware
  user: sdb://mysqlite/svc_acct
  password: sdb://mysqlite/svc_pass
  url: 'vcenter-host'

```
Using the latest version salt-cloud I am getting errors.  This works with the 2019.x versions.  If I replace the sdb:// entries with the credentials all works properly.
This works properly:
```
 salt-run sdb.get 'sdb://mysqlite/svc_acct'
 salt-run sdb.get 'sdb://mysqlite/svc_pass'
```
I have already tried the patch mentioned in #57016  to no avail
