I'm using salt 2014.1.1-1precise1 on ubuntu 12.04.

I want to append an ssh host key to a known_hosts file, but salt won't let me if the known_hosts file doesn't already exist:

```
$ salt 'append-test' state.single file.append name=/root/.ssh/known_hosts contents_pillar=github:hostkey
append-test:
----------
          ID: /root/.ssh/known_hosts
    Function: file.append
      Result: False
     Comment: /root/.ssh/known_hosts: file not found
     Changes:   

Summary                                                                                    
------------

```

I was able to work around it by requiring file.touch first, but that is not ideal.
