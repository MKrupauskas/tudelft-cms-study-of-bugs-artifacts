The rdp.py module only appears to be compatible with Windows Vista and higher only as the namespace used for querying the terminal services settings is not supported on XP and 2003.

The namespace on XP and Server 2003 is 'root\cimv2' and 'root\cimv2\TerminalServices' on Vista and newer.

When rdp.status is run on a 2003 Server the system will throw a Get-WmiObject : Invalid namespace error.

Not sure if it is also possible but since Powershell is a requirement, it should be perhaps noted in the docs or checked for in the module as 2003 Servers did not ship with Powershell.
