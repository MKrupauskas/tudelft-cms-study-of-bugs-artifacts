To give a practical example: `gitlab-formula/gitlab/init.sls` includes some external formulas. If for example I try to include postgresql instead of postgres, when I run `salt \* state.sls gitlab` the error I'll get is:

```
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'gitlab' in env 'base'
```

instead of informing me it can't find the included sls.
