A freshly installed Minion on Ubuntu 12.04.4 is showing similar behavior as I have mentioned in #10317, the minion.d file (currently only have one) is being read a about 5-10 times during the start of the minion.

Same applies on minion.pem which is being loaded about as much during startup. At first it appeared to be on purpose to prevent the memory from being read but since none of the subsequent calls are loading the key it appears it may be a bug instead.

Here is the relevant part of the logs:
Minion.pem:

Note that this is based on a grep done on the logfile, some other things are being logged in between..
