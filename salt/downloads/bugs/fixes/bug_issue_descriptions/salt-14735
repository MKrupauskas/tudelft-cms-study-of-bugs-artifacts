If you make a mistake in your SLS files you can end up with not so descriptive errors like:

```
local:
    - No matching sls found for 'some.special.state' in env 'base'
```

Even though `some/special/state.sls` exists fine but you made an error somewhere. Errors in general are not very explanatory (e.g. raw python responses). This should be more helpful.
