### Description of Issue/Question

`ec2_pillar.py` will not pull `instance-id` when present in grains list falsely failing to populate pillar data.

### Setup
Setup of master config to enable ec2_pillar
```
ext_pillar:
  - ec2_pillar:
      use_grain: True
      tag_list_sep: ';'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Enable the ec2_pillar with the above and refresh pillar. Doing so will not populate the pillar correctly and have an error message when running salt master in debug.

```
Minion-id is not in AWS instance-id formation, and there is no instance-id grain for minion XXXX
```

Following up on this log it looks like the ec2_pillar file is calling grains but not in the correct way.

Modifying this line https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/95d1b9c032a6aa336891552dcc27c05bbe4ba5c8/salt/pillar/ec2_pillar.py#L113 to
```
grain_instance_id = __grains__.get('instance-id', None)
```
fixes the issue and pulls the `instance-id` correctly. When running a `grains.ls` I do not see a `meta-data` key either.

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
