When using a backport or a newer version distributed by a vendor (in this case saltstack), one would like to be able to use the "fromrepo" attribute for pkg.installed

With the new repo.saltstack.com you've abandoned the "DISTRO-saltstack-VERSION" namespace (eg. jessie-saltstack-2015-05), this is a real shame because we cannot use the fromrepo and the tedious way of doing it is to deploy some apt-pinning... (not recommended)
