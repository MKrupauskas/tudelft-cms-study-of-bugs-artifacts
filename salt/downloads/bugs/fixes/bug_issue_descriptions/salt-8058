I'm running a salt minion masterless on CentOS 5.10. It is a very minimal installation, so it's likely that something is missing that would otherwise be there.

When I run the highstate I get to the point where the top file is being read and matched against (I think), but after attempting to cache modules, grain, etc, the highstate hangs after the MinionEvent sockets are displayed.

The minion config file:

```
file_client: local
```

The `top.sls` file:

```
base:
  'nodename:sample':
    - match: grain
    - testing
```

The `testing.sls` file (used for minions where the nodename grain is "sample"):

```
httpd:
  pkg:
    - installed
```

When I run the highstate (`sudo salt-call -l all state.highstate`) these are the last few lines of the output I get:

```

Here is the output from `sudo salt-call --versions-report`:

EDIT: Clarified that this is a minimal installation of the OS. Updated the `testing.sls` to attempt to install httpd instead of apache (silly me).
