Hello,

I use

```
# Setup the MySQL requirements for WSUMAGE-base
###########################################################
{{ magento['db_name'] }}:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: {{ magento['db_user'] }}
    - password: {{ magento['db_pass'] }}
    - host: {{ magento['db_host'] }}
    - require:
      - service: mysqld
  mysql_database.present:
    - name: {{ magento['db_name'] }}
    - require:
      - service: mysqld
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: all privileges
    - database: {{ magento['db_name'] }}.*
    - user: {{ magento['db_user'] }}
    - require:
      - service: mysqld
```

and get 

```
 Name: wsumage_network - Function: mysql_database.present - Result: True
----------
    State: - mysql_grants
    Name:      wsumage_network
    Function:  present
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

Looks like a Boolean is being treated as a list?
