**Description**
It looks like changing the hostname causes network.service to fail, as it does indeed not exist on CentOS stream

**Setup**

Something similar to the following:

```YAML
Configure Network Settings:
  network.system:
    - enabled: True
    - hostname: {{ fqdn }}
    - apply_hostname: True
    - retain_settings: True
    - dns:
      {%- for ip in ip4_resolvers %}
      - {{ ip }}
      {%- endfor %}
      {%- if inv.get('ip6') %}
        {%- for ip in ip6_resolvers %}
      - {{ ip }}
        {%- endfor %}
      {%- endif %}
```

on a CentOS Stream minion should do it.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
See above.

**Expected behavior**
The network settings should be applied without error.

is raised, and it's accurate- CentOS Stream does in fact not have any unit named `network.service`:

```Bash

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

1 loaded units listed.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
```
```Bash
[ ~ ] # systemctl list-unit-files --all network.service
