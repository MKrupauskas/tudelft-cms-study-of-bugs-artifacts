E.g. a `Git.config` entry fails rendering of the SLS file because git is not installed, even when it has `Pkg.installed('git')` above and as argument `require=[Pkg('git')]`.

This is tested to be the case with versions 2015.5.3, 2015.8 and develop.
All I could find on this is issue #10918 which was closed, but for an unexplained reason, I didn't see reference to a fix.

If this is impossible to fix, please consider deprecating pyobjects. I don't see any value in a renderer that needs manual installation of packages in order to work...
