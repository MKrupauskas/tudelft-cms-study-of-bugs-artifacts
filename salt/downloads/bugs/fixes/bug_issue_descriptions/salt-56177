### Description of Issue

when running an operation with the mysql state it fails as the conv object is not defined properly. I'm unsure whether PyMySQL handles it incorrectly, but I suspect it's rather salt as it should get the default value of `None`.

```
    Function: mysql_database.present
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1981, in call

                File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pymysql/connections.py", line 689, in __init__
                  self.encoders = dict([(k, v) for (k, v) in conv.items() if type(k) is not int])
              AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

the mysql connector tries to get the config option for `conv` https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L373:

```
    _connarg('connection_conv', 'conv', get_opts)
```

this tries to read it from the config  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L357:

```
            val = __salt__['config.option']('mysql.{0}'.format(name), None)
```

The default value should be `None`, but the method returns and empty string `` and therefor not `None` is returned.

the config option is then passed to PyMySQL which checks if `conv` is `None` (but not empty string: https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/blob/master/pymysql/connections.py#L302

Therefor it fails shortly after: https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/blob/master/pymysql/connections.py#L306
