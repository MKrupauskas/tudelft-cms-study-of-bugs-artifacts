### Description of Issue/Question

If the `master_finger` configuration option on the minion doesn't match the fingerprint of the master to which it's connecting, it stacktraces and hangs, rather than giving a nice error and failing gracefully as it does when the public key itself doesn't match:

```
root@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~# salt-minion

    self._finger_fail(self.opts['master_finger'], m_pub_fn)

```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Set `master_finger` on the minion to a fingerprint which doesn't match the master RSA key
