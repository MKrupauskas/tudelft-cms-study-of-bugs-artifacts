With the behaviour of cmd.powershell automatically adding 'ConvertTo-Json -Depth 32' some commands will not return. The bug isn't really with salt but rather how the PowerShell command ConvertTo-Json deals with such a high depth.
### Expected Behavior

cmd.powershell should return the output of the command
### Actual Behavior

Certain commands will not return data in a reasonable time frame. 
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

cmd.run 'dir' works
cmd.run 'dir' shell='powershell' works
cmd.run 'dir | ConvertTo-Json' works
cmd.run 'dir | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 32' never returns
cmd.powershell 'dir' never returns
Simply running 'dir | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 32' in PowerShell on a windows machine will display the same behaviour

I would propose that the default depth of 2 is used and a flag 'json_depth' is introduced to allow users needing a higher depth to override it.
