From an EC2 with instance credentials, when trying to access an s3 via fileclient.get_url an AttributeError is raised and squashed.

```
In [1]: from salt.fileclient import LocalClient
In [2]: import salt.config
In [3]: config = salt.config.minion_config("/etc/salt/minion")
In [4]: c = LocalClient(config)
In [5]: c.get_url("s3://<my_bucket>/<my_key>", "/tmp/test.file", makedirs=True)
MinionError: Could not fetch from s3://<my_bucket>/<my_key>"
```

Exception is being caught by an almost completely bare except clause:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/fileclient.py#L561
Taking that out raises an AttributeError.
It appears that s3 is never imported into salt.utils or salt.utils.s3 is never imported in salt.fileclient
Workaround for now:

```
In [8]: import salt.utils.s3 as s3
In [9]: salt.fileclient.salt.utils.s3 = s3
In [10]: c.get_url("s3://<my_bucket>/<my_key>", "/tmp/test.file", makedirs=True)
Out[10]: '/tmp/test.file'
```
