### Description of Issue/Question

``` yaml
    productname:
        /dev/mem: No such file or directory
    biosreleasedate:
        /dev/mem: No such file or directory
    biosversion:
        /dev/mem: No such file or directory
    manufacturer:
        /dev/mem: No such file or directory
```

Probably better to have the grain emtpy... or not exist when /dev/mem is not present.
### Setup

Ubuntu under SmartOS as a LX zone
