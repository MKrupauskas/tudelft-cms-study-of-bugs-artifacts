### Description of Issue/Question
This was initially discovered when using the boto_elasticache state, and noticed the issue actually lies within the module the state is using.

This particular boto module (and perhaps other boto modules) doesn't seem to use the supplied key, and keyid supplied into the module arguments, and likewise, their respective states. Placing credentials in ~/.aws/credentials will work though.

I haven't had enough time to trace the issue, but all of the functions in the boto.elasticache module use the following to get/test the connection info:
`conn = _get_conn(region=region, key=key, keyid=keyid, profile=profile)`

Following this may lead to the issue.

### Setup
```
salt-call boto_elasticache.get_config mct-ec1 region='us-west-1' key='xxx' keyid='xxx'
[ERROR   ] Failed to get config for cache cluster mct-ec1.
local:
```

This EC cluster exists.. If I place the credentials in ~/.aws./credentials instead of supplying via CLI, this works.

```
salt-call boto_elasticache.get_config mct-ec1 region='us-west-1'
local:
    ----------
    engine:
        memcached
    cache_parameter_group:
        default.memcached1.4
    cache_cluster_id:
        mct-ec1
```
Yes, the credentials supplied via CLI and what's stored in the credentials file match. :)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use credentials supplied via CLI in the module arguments, and make sure none are specified in ~/.aws/credentials as you may get a false positive.
