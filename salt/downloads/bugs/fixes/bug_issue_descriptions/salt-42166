### Description of Issue/Question
While playing around for #40320 

I wrote the following state to see if it would handle a IPv6 network.
```
/tmp/test:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ '2001:470:7ee7:30::/64' | network_hosts }}
```

Which resulted in
```

```

Give the massive size of an IPv6 subnet this is not unexpected, but /64 is a common netmask.
This should be handled better, maybe print a warning if there will be to many entries?
