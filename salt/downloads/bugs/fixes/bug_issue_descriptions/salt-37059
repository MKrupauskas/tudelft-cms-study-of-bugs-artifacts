### Description of Issue/Question

If you create a beacon which fetches any files from the master, any scheduled jobs you have which utilize the fileserver will hang at 100% CPU forever.
### Setup

/srv/salt/_beacons/hangtest.py

```
import logging
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
def beacon(config):
    log.info('Running hangtest beacon')
    __salt__['cp.cache_file']('salt://_beacons/hangtest.py')
    return []
```

/srv/pillar/top.sls

```
base:
  '*':
    - hangtest
```

/srv/pillar/hangtest.sls

```
beacons:
  hangtest:
    interval: 1

schedule:
  cache_file_for_hang:
    function: cp.cache_file
    seconds: 10
    args:
      - salt://_beacons/hangtest.py
    return_job: False
```

Setup:

```
# salt '*' saltutil.sync_all
# salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar
# service salt-minion restart
```

The second run of the scheduled job (about 10 seconds after minion start) should hang forever at 100% CPU. Note that `service salt-minion stop` will not stop that process either.

Removing the `cp.cache_file` from the beacon fixes the issue. Scheduled jobs that don't use the fileserver (such as `test.ping`) will not hang even with fileserver operations in the beacon.
