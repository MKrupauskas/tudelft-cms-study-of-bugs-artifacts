Using 2014.7.0rc6

Tested on CentOS 6.5 (ssh-minion on Rackspace)

Probably not describing/wording this entirely accurately. Contact me for other details if needed.

In talking with Tom, we can add this to the Known Issues list of 2014.7.0 and fix in 2014.7.1.

Ran the following command from master: salt-ssh gwtest state.sls apache

Here is the apache.sls:

```
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    {% if grains['os_family'] == 'RedHat' %}
    - name: httpd
    {% elif grains['os_family'] == 'Debian' %}
    - name: apache2
    {% endif %}
```

Get the following results on master:

```
gwtest:
----------
          ID: apache
    Function: pkg.installed
        Name: httpd
      Result: False
     Comment: The following package(s) were not found, and no possible matches were found in the package db: httpd

When troubleshooting on ssh-minion, ran this command: `python salt-call --local -l debug -c /tmp/.root_1ec649__salt/ pkg.list_pkgs`

Get this error:

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'repoquery --plugins --queryformat="%{NAME}_|-%{VERSION}_|-%{RELEASE}_|-%{ARCH}_|-%{REPOID}" --all --pkgnarrow=installed' failed with return code: 127
[ERROR   ] stderr: /bin/bash: repoquery: command not found
```

Installed yum-utils on ssh-minion

Re-ran with success the same command: `python salt-call --local -l debug -c /tmp/.root_1ec649__salt/ pkg.list_pkgs`

Re-ran state file from master against same minion with a success.

Looks like we have a dependency on `yum-utils` for this module. Should probably remove this dep.
