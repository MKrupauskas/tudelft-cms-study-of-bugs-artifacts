Trying to use contents_pillar to populate rsa private and public keys for github access in my salt minions. Using salt v.0.17.0

This is how I'm using it

https://github.com/bakodo/salt-states/blob/master/salt/deploy/init.sls#L14

```
deploykey:
  file.managed:
    - name: /root/.ssh/github_{{ pillar['repo_name'] }}
    # - source: salt://deploy/id_rsa
    - contents_pillar: 'id_rsa'
    - makedirs: True
    - mode: 600
```

$salt '*' pillar.get id_rsa 
shows the key is there

The resulting private key file is empty
