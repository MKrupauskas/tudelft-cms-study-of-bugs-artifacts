### Description of Issue/Question
This is basically the same issue like #13197 for Debian/Ubuntu based OS: If you install a pkg from specific deb you can't pass a version information to *aptpkg*. Instead of the yum pkg provider, *aptpkg* uses *pkg_resource.parse_targets* to parse *sources* which doesn't support *<pkg_name>-\<version>* notation.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create and run a state which installs *my_custom_pkg-0.1-1.deb*, i.e.
    ```yaml
    install custom package:
      pkg.installed:
        - sources:
          - my_custom_pkg: salt://test-pkg-sources/files/my_custom_pkg-0.1-1.deb
    ```
2. Now try to deploy *my_custom_pkg-0.2-1.deb*. You would try to change the source file but your Minions won't pick up the changes because my_custom_pkg is already present.

### Current workaround
Create a lock grain item or file with version information to check for. If not present force installation and set new lock.

### Salt solution
It would be nice if we could use same logic across various pkg provider when supported. I.e. implement same parser logic. However, this won't be that easy because *aptpkg* provider supports *<pkg_name>:<arch>* notation according to comments in source code yum provider for example doesn't support.
