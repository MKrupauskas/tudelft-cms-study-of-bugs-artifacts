### Description of Issue/Question

I have a custom reactor in which I am creating a custom event and including grain values

```
  _mminion().functions['event.send']('scheduled-job-return', data=event_data,
                                     with_grains=[
                                       "teams",
                                       "servicerole",
                                       "flavor",
                                       "cluster",
                                       "environment",
                                       "owner",
                                       "pod",
                                       "alert_channel",
                                     ])
```

In a few cases the "alert_channel" grain is not defined on the minion.  When I process the event in my reactor, the value of `data.grains["alert_channel"]` is the string "None" instead of the value None.
