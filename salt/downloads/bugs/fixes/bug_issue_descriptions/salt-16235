`--state-output` seems to be broke in latest `develop` branch. It seems to show full output even if `terse` or `changes` are given.

``` sh
salt --state-output=terse \* state.highstate
```

I don't think there are any tests for the state_output parsers as far as I can tell. Probably should implement test for these if not.
