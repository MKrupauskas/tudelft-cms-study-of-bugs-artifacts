**Description**
`pillar_cache_backed: memory` is not experimental it is just broken. pillar makes log.debug calls to `self.cache._dict` however the CacheDict object does not have a _dict Attribute. while the CacheDisk object does. this completely breaks pillar if you try setting the pillar_cache backend to memory. 

**Setup**
set up pillar cache with `pillar_cache_backend: memory` refresh the minions cache and very the masters log and also see there are no pillars on the minions. 

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

See setup steps above and look in the logs for the following error and see that no minions have pillar. 

```
2020-10-29 08:40:17,845 [salt.master      :2019][ERROR   ][7443] Error in function _pillar:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    log.debug("Scanning cache: %s", self.cache._dict)
AttributeError: 'CacheDict' object has no attribute '_dict'
```


**Expected behavior**
Even if experimental the basic functionality should at least keep a catastrophic failing of pillar rendering from happening.

Although this issue goes back to at least 2018.3.5 maybe as far back as when the option to include `pillar_cache_backend` was allowed.
