When running a command as follows:

```
root@salt-dev:~# salt-call boto_asg.exists name=test-ec2-vpc --log-level debug
```

The following is returned:

```
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Using cached minion ID from /etc/salt/minion_id: salt-dev
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
```

Expected behavior is:

```
root@salt-dev:~# salt-call boto_asg.exists test-ec2-vpc --log-level debug
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Using cached minion ID from /etc/salt/minion_id: salt-dev
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded .returner

    True
```
