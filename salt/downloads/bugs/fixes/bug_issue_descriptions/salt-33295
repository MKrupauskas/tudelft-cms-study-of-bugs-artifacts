### Description of Issue/Question

The service.running state fails on Linux Mint, with `KeyError: 'service.enabled'`. For current versions of Mint, the os and os_family grains are both set to 'LinuxMint' by default. Manually setting them in /etc/salt/grains to "Mint" and "Debian" respectively (which I believe were the old defaults) corrects the behavior. Grepping the modules directory suggests that upstart.py contains the module that should be used, but it is checking the OS grain for 'Mint' as opposed to 'LinuxMint'.

(A similar failed grain lookup seems to break several saltstack formulas, FYI -- so far I've had trouble with ntp-formula and salt-formula)
### Setup

A simple state can reproduce the behavior:

```
test-service:
  service.running:
    - name: ssh
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use bootstrap to install on a Mint 17.3 box.
Run the state above and get this:

```
[INFO    ] Completed state [ssh] at time 22:06:57.799060
local:

          ID: testsvc
    Function: service.running
        Name: ssh
      Result: False

### Workaround

Applying the old(?) grains in /etc/salt/grains makes things work again:

```
os_family: Debian
os: Mint
```
