### Description of Issue/Question
When an spm package has been previously installed, and spm install -f is used to install a newer version of the package, running spm info <formula> doesn't show that the version has been updated.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Generate a new SPM-enabled formula repo, such as with this cookiecutter: https://github.com/mitodl/saltstack-formula-cookiecutter (formula doesn't have to do anything, just having the format is good enough)
Version should already be set to 1 in the FORMULA file
Run spm build 
Run spm install <formula>
Run spm info <formula>
Make a change to init.sls file in the formula
Bump the version to 2 in the FORMULA file
Run spm build
Run spm update_repo
Run spm install -f <formula>
Run spm info <formula>
Note that the sls change was made, but the version from spm info was not updated
