v2014.7 significantly changes the semantics of the event listeners:

```
#2014.1.10
event = salt.utils.event.MasterEvent('/var/run/salt/master')
# an event A is generated here
e = event.get_event()
# e represents event A
```

```
#2014.7
event = salt.utils.event.MasterEvent('/var/run/salt/master')
# an event A is generated here
e = event.get_event()
# e misses event A
# an event B is generated here
e = event.get_event()
# e captures event B â€¦ maybe â€¦
```
