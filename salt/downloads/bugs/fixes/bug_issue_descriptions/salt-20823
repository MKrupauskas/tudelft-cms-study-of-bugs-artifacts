Hello! EC2 operations fails when there is unicode tags on any of instances:

```
$ salt-call -l trace cloud.full_query
.....
[DEBUG   ] Failed to execute 'ec2.list_nodes_min()' while querying for running nodes: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 70860-70863: ordinal not in range(128)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2198, in run_parallel_map_providers_query
    cloud.clouds[data['fun']]()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py", line 2720, in list_nodes_min
    instances = query(params)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py", line 345, in query
    result.text
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 70860-70863: ordinal not in range(128)
......
```

By the way, even with --hard-crash option this exception is caught somewhere, and I can't figure out how to run pdb to debug it.
