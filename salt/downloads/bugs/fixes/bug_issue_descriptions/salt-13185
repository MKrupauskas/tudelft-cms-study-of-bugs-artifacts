Hi folks,

First off, Salt is amazing!!! Made my life a thousand times simpler :) Thank you for creating such a wonderful piece of software.

I'm having some problems though. When I try to do a file.recurse on a directory that resides on gitfs, it fails. It says that the directory does not exist. However, if I try to do file.managed on a file inside that directory, it works.

So the following config doesn't work:

myprogram_conf:
  file.recurse:
    - name: /usr/local/bin/myprogram/conf/
    - source: salt://myprogram/files/conf/

It returns:  "The directory 'salt://myprogram/files/conf' does not exist on the salt fileserver in saltenv 'dev'"

But this one works fine:

myprogram_conf:
  file.managed:
    - name: /usr/local/bin/myprogram/conf/a.txt
    - source: salt://myprogram/files/conf/a.txt

I only have this issue when the source file/directory is in gitfs. Does file.recurse not work for gitfs based dirs?

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.
