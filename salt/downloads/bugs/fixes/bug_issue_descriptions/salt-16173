hi:
   this is the thing

I create a custom grains that include two funtions ,it can return a dist {a:'123',b:'234'} ,then i executed 
saltutil.sync_grains command, so i can use grains.get commond to get "a"  and "b" result.
while , i changed my grains let  it  return dist  {a:"123"} and use saltutil.sync_grains again, but somehow ,i still can use "grains.get  b " command to get  output "234"

ps: salt-run cache.clear_all was used in my test case.
