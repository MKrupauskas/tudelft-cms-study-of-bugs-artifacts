I have the following custom grain:

cat /srv/salt/_grains/dave.py

```
def zzz():
    me = {}
    me['zzzzz'] = 'Dave grain'
    return me
```

It is not getting deployed to salt-ssh minions.

I did see that custom modules and states are being synced to:

```
/tmp/.root_salt/running_data/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_modules
/tmp/.root_salt/running_data/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_states
```

But there is no:

```
/tmp/.root_salt/running_data/var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_grains
```
