Again a retrocompat bug, dying here because we used a watch rather than a require is a total nonsense.
I'm ok that pkg.latest will not react on a watch, i'm not OK for it to die, moreover on states i wrote a LONG while ago...
We should make the state warn (yellow) and put the comment, but dying is too hard...
Watch is "just" a specilized require, afterall.
