We are using the cassandra_driver-1.0.0b7-py2.6 code installed to /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/ on RHEL 6. This works fine in stand-alone python scripts and if imported into an execution module running under salt 2014.1.0 using the following syntax:

```
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
from cassandra.decoder import dict_factory
```

However, it does not import into an external pillar we are trying to write but gives the error:
    ImportError: No module named cluster
