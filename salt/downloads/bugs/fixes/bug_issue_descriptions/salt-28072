I just rolled a fresh Salt master running 2015.8.1, freshly installed libgit2 from source and hit this issue:

```
[ERROR   ] Exception 'authentication required but no callback set' caught while fetching git_pillar remote 'production git@gitlab.com:...'
[ERROR   ] Exception 'authentication required but no callback set' caught while fetching gitfs remote 'git@gitlab.com:...
```

Rolling back to pygit/libgit 0.22.x solved my issue, but I didn't see an open issue regarding this problem, so I figured it'd be good to at least have an issue open about it. I don't have time to produce a fix right now - sorry! For anyone curious, I believe the problem ties to this pull request: https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2/pull/568
