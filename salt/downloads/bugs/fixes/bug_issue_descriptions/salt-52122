I used to store a bunch of stuff in custom grains.conf, some of which was host specific, and I switched it all over to pillars. I used to be able to target that data via grains, but when I try to target via `salt -I var:value` it times out (`test.ping` and `state.apply test=true`) and the minion doesn't return even though it picks the correct minions to talk to. My sole remaining 2018 minion does return either the `test.ping` or `state.apply test=true` 

The pillars do work for pulling data into my .sls files. It's just the targeting that's not functioning.

### Setup
My pillars look like:

```
{% if opts['id'] == 'hostname' %}
   owner: bob
   provider: aws
   location: oh
   role: webserver
   phpversion: php71
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I run:
`salt "*" saltutil.refresh_pillar` and it updates all minions.
`salt "*" pillar.itmes` shows all the data it's supposed to for all minions.
`salt -I "owner:bob" test.ping`  only works for my one minion running 2018.

The exact error message is: `    Minion did not return. [Not connected]`

No error messages in the minion logs on the minions.
