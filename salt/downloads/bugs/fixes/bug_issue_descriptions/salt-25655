I'm using salt-ssh, which automatically sets root_dir to `/tmp/.user_hash__salt`, which is where the thin client is deployed. This is fine, except I'd love it if it was possible to define a path (specifically the log path) outside of the root dir.

The problem is that the [`salt.utils.path_join` function](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b6f42ca951a2439bce024dc0c40c6a89d8149468/salt/utils/__init__.py#L839-L861), used when [parsing paths in the config](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b6f42ca951a2439bce024dc0c40c6a89d8149468/salt/config.py#L1388-L1400), behaves differently from `os.path.join`.

```
>>> import os.path
>>> os.path.join('/foo', '/bar')
'/bar'
>>> import salt.utils
>>> salt.utils.path_join('/foo', '/bar')
'/foo/bar'
```

This means I can't just put `log_dir: /var/log/salt/minion` into the config and expect it to work. On the other hand I can't imagine this can be changed, as a lot of current code relies on this behaviour (correct me if I'm wrong).

Could there be a way to configure a path to be outside the root dir?
