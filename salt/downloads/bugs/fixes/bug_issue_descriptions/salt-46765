### Description of Issue/Question
I am trying to configure the epel yum repository to use a local mirror after installing the epel-release package to set a baseurl and remove the metalink that is set. 

When trying to remove the metalink setting, I get an error.

### Setup
No special setup is required.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
0. Start with a RedHat 7 or CentOS 7 system
1. yum install -y http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm
2. salt-call --local pkg.mod_repo epel metalink= baseurl='http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/$basearch'

```

```

A solution is to modify this section in `mod_repo` function as follows:
```
    # Build a list of keys to be deleted
    todelete = []
    for key in repo_opts:
        if repo_opts[key] != 0 and not repo_opts[key]:
            del repo_opts[key]
            todelete.append(key)
```

To:
```
    # Build a list of keys to be deleted
    todelete = []
    for key in repo_opts:
        if repo_opts[key] != 0 and not repo_opts[key]:
            todelete.append(key)
    for key in todelete:
        del repo_opts[key]
```
