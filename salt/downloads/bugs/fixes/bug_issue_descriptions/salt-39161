### Description of Issue/Question
There are some inconsisencies in salt-ssh regarding pillars defined with match:grain. It seems pillars are defined but not usable. 
I'm not sure if it is a bug, or a side-effect of the limitations of salt-ssh with minions targeting

### Setup
/etc/salt/roster : 
```
test:
  host: 10.0.0.1
  priv: agent-forwarding
  grains:
    roles:
      - apache
```

/srv/pillar/top.sls
```
base:
  'roles:apache':
    - match: grain
    - certs/certbot
```
/srv/pillar/certs/certbot.sls
```
certs:
  certbot:
    - {{ grains['fqdn'] }}
```

When checking our pillar, we get : 
```
$ salt-ssh 'test' grains.get roles
test:
    - apache

$ salt-ssh 'test' pillar.items
test:
    ----------
```
This seems to confirm that grain matching does not work. If I use match:list, or globing, everything works fine. 

However, what puzzles me happens when running a highstate: 
/srv/salt/top.sls
```
base:
  'certs:certbot':
    - match: pillar
    - states/ssl/certs

  'roles:apache':
    - match: grain
    - states/apache2
```
```
$ salt-ssh 'test' state.apply test=True
test:
[...]
    - Rendering SLS 'base:states/ssl/certs' failed: Jinja error: 'Pillar key not found: certs'
[...]
      {% if pillar['certs'] is defined %}
      {% if 'certbot' in salt['pillar.keys']('certs') %}    <======================
```
The state is run, meaning the pillar exists. But the state can't find it. 
And if I comment out the lines about certs:certbot, the state for apache2 is run, meaning the gain match here.
