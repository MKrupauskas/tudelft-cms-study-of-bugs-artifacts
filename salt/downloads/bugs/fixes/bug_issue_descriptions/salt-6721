I am trying to use a state to disable Linux (CentOS 5) bonded interfaces that was configured during kickstart.

```
bond1:
  network.managed:
    - type: bond
    - enabled: False
```

throws the following exception:

```
    State: - network
    Name:      bond1
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1201, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/network.py", line 175, in managed
    new = __salt__['ip.build_interface'](name, type, enabled, kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/rh_ip.py", line 824, in build_interface
    opts = _parse_settings_eth(settings, iface_type, enabled, iface)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/rh_ip.py", line 560, in _parse_settings_eth
    bonding = _parse_settings_bond(opts, iface)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/rh_ip.py", line 204, in _parse_settings_bond
    if opts['mode'] in ['balance-rr', '0']:
KeyError: 'mode'
```

Documentation does not list "mode" as a required parameter for network.managed - nor should it really be needed if the state is being used to disable something.

The workaround is to add "- mode: 0" or any other valid value.
