 I've run into an issue with the orchestration runner in the new 2016.3.0 version.

We use the orchestration runner heavily and the fixes to this runner are the main reason we're trying to upgrade ASAP; however, this issue is somewhat of a blocker.

The orchestration runner seems to not return the 'highstate' formatted output when everything succeeds but it does return it when there is a failure in one of the states.

Quick example:

install_vim.sls contains:

```
vim-enhanced:
  pkg.installed
```

test_orch.sls contains:

```
test_orchestartion:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: '*'
    - sls: install_vim
```

This is what I get when I run it:

```
salt-run state.orchestrate test_orch

```

Now if I change the vim package name in install_vim.sls to 'bad_package_name':

```
