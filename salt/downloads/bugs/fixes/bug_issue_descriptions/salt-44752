### Description of Issue/Question

I'm just experimenting with salt-api.  I started up the daemon while I had an incorrect path to the TLS files.  The log message said "Did not find any netapi configurations, nothing to start".  Once I ran "sudo salt-api -l debug" it was clear what the problem is.

The log message made me think I was _missing_ some configuration, rather than having incorrect configuration.  Perhaps the log message could be improved, or the exception from salt.netapi.res_cherrypy could be caught and logged.
I suggest that the error log message should be modified

### Setup

I'm using a Debian Jessie salt-master, with the 2017.7.2+ds-1 version of the salt-master and salt-api packages installed, from "http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/latest/ jessie/main amd64 Packages".  The relevant section of my master configuration:

$ cat /etc/salt/master.d/cherrypy.conf
rest_cherrypy:
  port: 8000
  ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/localhost.crt
  ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/localhost.key

Note that the ssl_crt and ssl_key paths are incorrect, so those files do not exist. 


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

When starting salt-api the following is logged in /var/log/salt/api:

2017-11-29 16:14:33,372 [salt.client.netapi][ERROR   ][1067] Did not find any netapi configurations, nothing to start


When running "sudo salt-api -l debug" there is (of course) lots of output, the most relevant of which looks like:

Process salt.loaded.int.netapi.rest_cherrypy.start:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 258, in _bootstrap
    self.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 114, in run
    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/__init__.py", line 90, in start
    verify_certs(apiopts['ssl_crt'], apiopts['ssl_key'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/netapi/rest_cherrypy/__init__.py", line 72, in verify_certs
    raise Exception(msg.format(arg))
Exception: Could not find a certificate: /etc/pki/tls/localhost.crt
If you want to quickly generate a self-signed certificate, use the tls.create_self_signed_cert function in Salt
