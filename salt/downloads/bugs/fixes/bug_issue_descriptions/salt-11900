## Problem/Example

This is a simple Salt state to enable and start `jenkins` service:

```
# jenkins.sls
activate_jenkins_service:
    service.running:
        - name: jenkins
        - enable: True
```

Official Jenkins installation on [RedHat/CentOS/Fedora](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+RedHat+distributions#InstallingJenkinsonRedHatdistributions-Start%2FStop) uses init.d/sysv scripts.

Manually enabling and starting through init.d/sysv scripts perfectly works even on systemd-based Fedora 20:

```
systemctl enable jenkins                                                                                                                                                                             
jenkins.service is not a native service, redirecting to /sbin/chkconfig.
Executing /sbin/chkconfig jenkins on

systemctl start jenkins
```

On the other hand, Salt fails to execute the state:

```
salt-call -l all state.sls jenkins
...
          ID: activate_jenkins_service
    Function: service.running
        Name: jenkins
      Result: False
     Comment: The named service jenkins is not available
     Changes:   
...
```
## Cause

The problem stems from the fact that Salt executes `systemctl list-unit-files` command which only lists systemd unit files excluding init.d/sysv scripts:

```
...
[INFO    ] Executing state service.running for jenkins
[INFO    ] Executing command 'systemctl --full list-unit-files | col -b' in directory '/root'
...
```

Because Salt doesn't see required `jenkins` service in the list of unit files, it doesn't pass next execution to `systemctl` for enabling/starting/... the service and does't let `systemctl` to tell "authoritatively" about actual existence of the service.
## Proposal

This issue is very closely related to issue #8444 (as far as the proposed solution is concerned) and described in [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8444#issuecomment-28317923).

Rather than executing any pre-validation logic (i.e. finding service name somewhere), Salt should rely on systemd (and its `systemctl` command) to determine whether states to enable/start/... the service failed or succeeded. In other words, Salt should execute `systemctl` with any arbitrary service name optimistically and report result of the execution instead of trying to predict its outcome.
## Workaround

Again, see it in issue #8444.
