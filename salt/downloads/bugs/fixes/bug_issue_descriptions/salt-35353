### Description of Issue/Question

I have a simple mysql user salt state that should update the password of the root user:

```
set-mysql-root-password:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: root
    - host: localhost
    - password: {{ rootpass }}
    - connection_pass: ""
    - unix_socket: False
    - watch:
      - pkg: install-mysql-server
```

The problem is, that during the installation of mysql-server on Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) the `root@localhost` user is created with the `auth_socket` authentication plugin.

This means that the password change of Salt does not really do anything. It might change the password but you still can only login via Unix Socket.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `state.highstate` with the above state and a mysql user `root@localhost` present with auth plugin `auth_socket`.

Salt tells you everything is fine:

```
----------
          ID: set-mysql-root-password
    Function: mysql_user.present
        Name: root
      Result: True
     Comment: User root@localhost is already present with the desired password
     Started: 20:02:43.512921
    Duration: 16.678 ms
     Changes:   
----------
```

You still will not be able to login with that user / password.
