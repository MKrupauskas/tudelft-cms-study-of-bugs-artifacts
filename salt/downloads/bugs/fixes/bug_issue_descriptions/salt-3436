My pillar data is supplied by cmd_yaml, and some of it is unicoded (UTF-8). I have used `pdb` and printf-style debugging to verify that the `ext_pillar` function in `salt/pillar/cmd_yaml.py` returns those data properly as unicode() type.

I want to use these data in a Jinja2 template. Unfortunately (again using `pdb` and printf-style debugging), the data passed as "Context" to the Jinja2 processor are no longer unicoded.

This means that somewhere within Salt, between `ext_pillar` and instantiating a Jinja2 template as part of `file.managed`, the data are converted from Unicode to ASCII, without a conversion error, meaning that the data are squashed to an ASCII-representation. And indeed, the character 'â€¦' is stored as "\xe2\x80\xa6", not as "\u2026" as it should.
