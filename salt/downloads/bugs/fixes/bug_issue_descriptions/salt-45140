I using file.recurse to transfer a directory to a minion, most of the files in the directory are .dll files. Somtimes there is no problem,but sometimes, the names of some files may be change, and It caused my IIS service to be wrong. 

Here is my .sls file
```
D:\EZP.WeiXin.Service.Host:
  file.recurse:
    - source: salt://release/EZP.WeiXin/{{pillar["version"]}}
    - mkdirs: True
    - include_empty: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Sometimes, when I transfer those files first time, this problem will arise, 
this is the error commant:
`Failed to commit change: [Errno 13] Permission denied: u'F:/publish/EZP.WeiXin.Service.Host\\bin\\EZP.WeiXin.Service.Host.dll'`, 
and Execution results show failure.
but when I transfer them again without any change, the problem above was goneand execution results show successful. In spite of this, some of the names of some files have been changed very strangely.Like this:
![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24819310/34295072-55eaadd2-e746-11e7-9105-a30f58b12e88.png),it should have been "EZP.WeiXin.Service.Host.dll".
This happens more than once, and it's on different clients, different files. These minions's systems are all Winserver 2008 R2.
