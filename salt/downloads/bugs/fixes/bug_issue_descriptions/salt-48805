Hello @all,

Sorry, i am not VmWare specialist and can be wrong in some term, but i will try to  describe the situation.

We have two DC: DC1 and DC2.
Several servers located in DC1, several servers in DC2. But we have 3 servers which use _'Disaster Recovery Replica created VMware Site Recovery Manager'_. It is very cool[ VmWare feature](https://youtu.be/5OaSemd8qAc).

But on DC1 we have a real server. On DC2 we have 'copied fake server', look to pic:

Via salt-cloud we can not choose the correct VmWare farm and we can not create snapshot, because salt-cloud tried to create snapshot for 'copied fake server':
```
[me@secrect_host]$ sudo salt-cloud -y -a create_snapshot VM snapshot_name="just_for_fun" description="why not" memdump=False quiesce=False
[ERROR   ] Error while creating snapshot of VM: (vim.fault.MethodDisabled) {
   dynamicType = <unset>,
   dynamicProperty = (vmodl.DynamicProperty) [],
   msg = "The method is disabled by 'com.vmware.vcDr'",
   faultCause = <unset>,
   faultMessage = (vmodl.LocalizableMessage) [],
   source = 'com.vmware.vcDr'
}
vmware_farm_on_DC2:
    ----------
    vmware:
        ----------
        vm:
            failed to create snapshot
```

Could you please suggest something?

Thanks in advance!
