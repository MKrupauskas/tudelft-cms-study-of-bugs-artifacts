**Description**
After upgrading python-msgpack, salt was unable to transfer large volumes of information via salt-api due to msgpack's new max_str_length value. As far as I know there's no workaround available in Salt. I had to downgrade msgpack for my api-connected tools to continue working.

**Setup**
Salt 2019.2.4 or 3000.2 with python-msgpack > 0.5.6

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Attempt to retrieve a lot of information (for example a full copy of the minion data cache) from rest_cherrypy. If you tail the Master log, you'll see the data is generated and retrieved, but cannot be passed to salt-api because it is larger than msgpack's max_str_length value.

**Expected behavior**
salt-api gives you the information you ask for
