I need to parse output from salt. But when I run command like this: `salt -L node1,node2 cmd.run_all 'ls' --output=yaml --output-file=tmp.output`, I only got return of one node in tmp.output file.

I don't think it's correct. What I expected, it should be same as output in stdout when I run without '--output-file' option.

I think salt should append output to file here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/output/__init__.py#L25
