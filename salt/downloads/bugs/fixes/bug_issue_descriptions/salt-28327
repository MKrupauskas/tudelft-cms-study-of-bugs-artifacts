I have 3 servers. 1 master (master-01) and 2 minions (is-01 and is-05)
master-01 and is-01 has salt version 2015.5.2
is-05 has salt version 2015.5.5
When I try to get the FQDN grain of both is-\* servers from the master, I got different results for both of them.
The older version return the FQDN but the newer is returning only the hostname.
But, when I get the same grain locally on the is-05 (the newer salt version), I get the correct FQDN.

```
[root@master-01]$ salt -C 'cloud* or is-*' grains.get saltversion
master-01.domain.loc:
    2015.5.2
is-01.domain.loc:
    2015.5.2
is-05.domain.loc:
    2015.5.5

[root@master-01]$ salt 'is-*' grains.get fqdn
is-01.domain.loc:
    is-01.domain.loc
is-05.domain.loc:
    is-05

[root@is-05]$ salt-call grains.get fqdn
local:
    is-05.domain.loc
```

Why there is difference in the grain value depending of that is it come from the master with "salt" command or on the minion with "salt-call" command? And why different version return different value?
