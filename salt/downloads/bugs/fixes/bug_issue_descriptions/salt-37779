### Description of Issue/Question

When using the `debconf.set_file` state, it will always report changes when doing a test run and never report changes when not doing a test run.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

 1. Setup a file with debconf selections that differ from what is currently set.
 2. Do a highstate and notice no changes are reported
 3. Check output of debconf-getselections to see changes were applied
 4. Do another highstate with `test=True` and notice changes are reported although there are none
