Aborting a job leads to corrupted salt-thin.tgz in the next run

```
>>> salt-ssh minion test.ping

minion
----------
retcode:
    12
stderr:

    WARNING: checksum mismatch for "/tmp/.root_dcdf8c__salt/salt-thin.tgz"
stdout:
    ERROR: The salt thin transfer was corrupted
```

Shouldn't the file be ignored the next time or another tmp dir be created?
