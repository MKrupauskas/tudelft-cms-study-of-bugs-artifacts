I've setup consul on a saltmaster server, I testing creating keys/values using API and it seems all working fine. 

I used following setup on my saltmaster

```
consul_config:
  consul.host: 127.0.0.1
  consul.port: 8500

ext_pillar:
  - consul: consul_config root=salt-shared
  - consul: consul_config root=salt-private/%(minion_id)s
```

but when I run `pillar.items` i get this in the log file

```
2015-11-25 15:07:04,423 [salt.pillar                                ][ERROR   ][8498] Failed to load ext_pillar consul: argument to reversed() must be a sequence

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/pillar/consul_pillar.py", line 134, in fetch_tree
    for item in reversed(items):

```
