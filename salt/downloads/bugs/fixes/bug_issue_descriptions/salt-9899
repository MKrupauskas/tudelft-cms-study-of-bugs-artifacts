Trying out salt-virt I get the following error : 

```

This was after creating / removing / purging some images. Some images were remove through libvirt directly. 

At some point there seemed to be a "conflict" with a VM that was manually added to libvirt. cf this bit of log (tty.img is the manual VM)

```
qemu-img: Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/tty.img': No such file or directory

```
