### Description of Issue/Question

I'm seeing lots of WARNING level log messages in my salt minions log files, and they are mostly of this form:

[salt.loaded.int.module.rpm ][WARNING ][15309] Failed to interpret results of rpmdev-vercmp output: 0:5-3 == 0:5-3

I've previously installed rpmdevtools after a previous warning from Salt encouraged me to do so.

It looks like the output of rpmdevtools is different to what this code expects: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/rpm.py#L672
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run either:

`salt-call --local pkg.version_cmp '0.2-001' '0.2.0.1-002'` to see what Salt is doing:

Output:
[INFO    ] Executing command ['rpmdev-vercmp', '0:0.2-001', '0:0.2.0.1-002'] in directory '/root'
[WARNING ] Failed to interpret results of rpmdev-vercmp output: 0:0.2-001 < 0:0.2.0.1-002

OR

`rpmdev-vercmp '0.2-001' '0.2.0.1-002'` to see what the underlying rpmdev-vercmp library is doing:

Output:
0.2-001 < 0.2.0.1-002
