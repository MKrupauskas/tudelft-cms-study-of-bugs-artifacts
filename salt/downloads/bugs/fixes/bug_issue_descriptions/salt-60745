**Description**

Jinja gives a warning that `contextfunction` is being renamed to `pass_context` in Jinja 3.1:

```bash
/root/.pyenv/versions/3.6.10/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/utils/jinja.py:715: DeprecationWarning: 'contextfunction' is renamed to 'pass_context', the old name will be removed in Jinja 3.1.
```

This looks like it may be a slight fix by modifying https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/utils/jinja.py#L709 in order to avoid future problems with Jinja as our dependency tree upgrades over time. Though, I don't know how many additional steps may need to occur to ensure we can upgrade the dependency tree to contain Jinja 3.x.
