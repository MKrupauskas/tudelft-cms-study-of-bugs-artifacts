Running 2014.7 (+some backports) on Ubuntu14.04, the mdadm state does not currently work.
The error seems to basically come from the addition of `python_shell=False` to modules/mdadm.py in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/18288/files#diff-e37643eaf3d236b3cd45ab6b89a99da3R50

Also see my comment to the mentioned commit: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/18288#issuecomment-77892998

Regarding the error message, I assume that something is messing with the PATH, however the env dict seems to have it right (`mdadm` is in /sbin/). So it might be a more general problem with the 2014.7 implementation of `cmd.run` with python_shell=False.
