I'm writing an sls file that includes user.present and then sets the gid. (Windows)

The gid is being set to an AD group that includes a backslash.  So it takes the form of:

```
user.present:
-gid: ObfuscatedDomainName\obfuscated_domain_group.
```

Now, during the FIRST run of state.highstate, when the user HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN CREATED, the user.present call fails if the backslash is not escaped (so `\\`).

SUBSEQUENT calls of state.highstate fail with the message `"these values could not be changed: {'gid': 'ObfuscatedDomainName\\\\obfuscated_domain_group'}"` if the backslash IS escaped.  Notice how the backslash is double escaped.

I believe that the salt is doing escaping in some cases but not others.  I don't care whether the slash should or shouldn't need to be escaped in the sls, I just want it to be consistent.
