Here's the state :

squid:
  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
    - reload: True

When a change is made, it reloads Squid, but the status says "Service restarted".

---

```
State: - service
Name:      squid
Function:  running
    Result:    True
    Comment:   Service restarted
    Changes:   squid: True
```

Comment should say "Service reloaded". This would help with services that do not support reloading.
