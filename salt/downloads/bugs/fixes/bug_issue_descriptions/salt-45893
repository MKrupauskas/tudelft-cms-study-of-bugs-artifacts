### Description of Issue/Question
`archive.extracted` seems to be broken in 2017.7.3 w.r.t cached values.  [Debug log](https://gist.github.com/CrackerJackMack/c77370ff8fb8b242c7be7dcef4ad0389) shows the error manifesting in 2017.7.3.  This issue is **not** present in 2016.11.9.  Both versions were released on Feb 5th 2018.   I've been developing a new salt infrastructure just using "stable" with the bootstrap script and noticed my old working state was no longer working.  If previous stable was 2017.7.1 then this would be a regression.
