I have just added `source_hash_update: True` to an existing `archive.extracted` state that has been working happily for the last year and it causes an exception trying to compare checksums:

```
Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1733, in call

                  if compareChecksum(hash_fname, name, hash[1]):
              IndexError: list index out of range
```

My state looks like this:

```
{{role}}-{{environmentName}} {{installMedia}}:
  archive.extracted:
  - name: {{installMedia}}
  - source: {{remoteInstallArchive}}
  - source_hash: {{remoteInstallArchiveMd5}}
  - source_hash_update: True
  - user: root
  - group: root
  - archive_format: tar
  - tar_options: zxv
  - if_missing: {{installMedia}}
  - keep: True
  - onlyif: test -d {{installPath}}
```

I have tested this with **2016.3.2** and **2016.3.3** and both fail with the same error - am I doing something wrong?
