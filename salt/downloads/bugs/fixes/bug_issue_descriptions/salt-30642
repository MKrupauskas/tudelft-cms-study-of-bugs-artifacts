On 2015.8.3-253-gb1e604a I am trying to define a custom grain that should retrieve details from a device via proxy. The problem is that in the grain I cannot use the __proxy__ -- please check exception below:

```
NameError: global name '__proxy__'  is not defined
```

Moreover, I checked the logs and the grain is loaded **before** the init is called for the proxy.
