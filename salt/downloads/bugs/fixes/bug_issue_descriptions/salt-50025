This report has been prompted by a [user comment](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/salt-users/wP5r2nStBtI/TMripp5sAgAJ).

The very top of the `/etc/salt/master` config file reads:

    ##### Primary configuration settings #####
    ##########################################
    # This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master.
    # Values that are commented out but have an empty line after the comment are
    # defaults that do not need to be set in the config. If there is no blank line
    # after the comment then the value is presented as an example and is not the
    # default.

However, as mentioned there, some defaults do **not** have an empty line immediately following them, i.e.:

    #file_roots:
    #  base:
    #    - /srv/salt
    #

or:

    #pillar_roots:
    #  base:
    #    - /srv/pillar
    #

The reverse is also true, i.e.:

    #file_ignore_regex:
    #  - '/\.svn($|/)'
    #  - '/\.git($|/)'
    

or:

    #ext_pillar:
    #  - hiera: /etc/hiera.yaml
    #  - cmd_yaml: cat /etc/salt/yaml
    

It is quite confusing as, despite a very clear comment at the beginning of the config file, one cannot be sure whether a particular value is the default or not.

Do you have any means of auto-generating the `master` config file with the defaults correctly followed by a blank line?

If not, please let me know and I'll provide a patch.
