### Description of Issue/Question

The `runas` kwarg does not work as expected for the `cmd.run` state

Apparently there used to be a `user` argument which was deprecated in favour of `runas`.

However, the `cmd.run` state still wants & expects `user`, completely ignoring `runas` and not even giving a deprecation warning.

I'm quite willing to hack up a patch if confirmed, should be easy enough.
