### Description of Issue/Question
The JSON standard for an array is that it starts with a [ (left bracket) and ends with a ] (right bracket), with values between these being separated by a comma (http://www.json.org/index.html).

When using the salt runner module the array structure is being incorrectly formatted with whole array being wrapped in quotation marks("), including the left and right brackets, which makes the JSON structure incorrect.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I am running the following salt-run command against a Pure Storage FlashArray's RestAPI service:
```
# salt-run http.query https://10.234.112.107/api/1.8/host/salt-host method=POST data='{"wwnlist": ["0011223344556677","1122334455667788"]}' persist_session=True verify_ssl=false
error:
    HTTP 400: BAD REQUEST
status:
    400
```

Log file from storage array receiving incorrectly formed JSON structure:

```
2017-03-13 11:19:26.095 [INFO] 10.234.112.46 >> POST http://10.234.112.107/api/1.8/host/salt-host
{
  "wwnlist":"['0011223344556677', '1122334455667788']"
}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pure/rest/controller/util.py", line 97, in execute
    (command, args) = get_args(command_list, version, params)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pure/rest/controller/util.py", line 392, in get_args
    raise RestException("Value of argument {} needs to be one of {}.".format(key, arg.arg_type), Code.BAD_REQUEST)
RestException: Value of argument wwnlist needs to be one of ['list'].
2017-03-13 11:19:26.101 [WARNING] << 400 BAD REQUEST
{
  "msg":"Value of argument wwnlist needs to be one of ['list']."
}
```
The Pure Storage RestAPI works with Ansible URI module calls as well as Puppet and Python calls. Only Salt causes this error.
