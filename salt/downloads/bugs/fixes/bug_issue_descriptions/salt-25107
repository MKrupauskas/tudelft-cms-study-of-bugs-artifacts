There is a regression in how RunnerClient handles args/kwargs in develop (tested on dd80bec7689e). This will affect people calling runners via the Python API and salt-api.

@DmitryKuzmenko I apologize for not reading pull req #24831 more closely. The fix needs to be in RunnerClient and not in the rest_cherrypy module. We must maintain a backward compatible RunnerClient interface. Commit 954ba6e needs to be reverted.
