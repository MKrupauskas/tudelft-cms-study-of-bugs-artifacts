While working on the OpenEmbedded port of the salt-syndic script I noticed that salt-syndic by default creates the salt-syndic.pid and salt-syndic.log files on the root directory, instead of using the documented defaults /var/run/salt-syndic.pid and /var/log/salt/master.

I debugged the code and noticed (if I understood the code flow correctly....) that the function syndic_config (config.py) loads the default values from DEFAULT_MINION_OPTS and DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS first, then it sets the syndic log_file and pidfile settings to the values on the combined settings dictionary of 'syndic_log_file' and 'syndic_pidfile'. However, those values don't exist on  either DEFAULT_MINION_OPTS  or DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS, so the salt-syndic.log and salt-syndic.pid values are (incorrectly) applied as defaults. I was going to fix this myself, but looks like the problem is broader, as there is no DEFAULT_SYNDIC_OPTS.
