### Description of Issue/Question
We have a custom runner module that is used during bootstrapping new minions.  The initializing orchestration calls two functions from this module, in order to register them to some external services.  The second call would throw a KeyError module.function_name, even though the function was clearly there.  So mocked up some test sls to try and reproduce this.

### Setup
`_modules/runners/test.py`
```
import salt.client

def one():
  caller = salt.client.Caller()
  host = caller.cmd('grains.get','host')
  return host

def two():
  return 'TWO'
```
`orch.sls`
```
one:
  salt.runner:
    - name: test.one
two:
  salt.runner:
    - name: test.two
```

Output:
```
----------
          ID: one
    Function: salt.runner
        Name: test.one
      Result: True
     Comment: Runner function 'test.one' executed.
