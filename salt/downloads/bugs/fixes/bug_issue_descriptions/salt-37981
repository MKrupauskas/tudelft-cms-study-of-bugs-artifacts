### Description of Issue/Question

When creating vms into a vpc using ec2 in salt-cloud, the new vm will always have the default security group.

### Setup

/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/provider.conf

```
aws_provider:
    id: XX
    key: 'XX'
    driver: ec2
    keyname: admin
    private_key: /etc/salt/admin.pem
    ssh_username: ubuntu
    ssh_interface: private_ips
```

/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/profiles.conf

```
generic:
  provider: aws_provider
  location: us-east-1
  size: m4.xlarge
  image: ami-xxxxx
  del_root_vol_on_destroy: True
  minion:
    master: 1.1.1.1
  securitygroupid:
    - sg-1111111
  subnetid: subnet-dd999999
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt-cloud -p generic test1 -l trace`

This will always set to the 'default' security group. I added some prints to try and debug ec2.py. When salt-cloud queries for the group name it always gets back an empty set. 

This worked on the previous version of salt I was using: 2016.3.4. 

I also had to add the fix from here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/37966 to even get this far.
