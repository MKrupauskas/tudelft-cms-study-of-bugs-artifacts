pillar.get through the salt.client.Caller interface is intermittent. It appears to be an authentication issue according to the logs. 

We do have a work-around, and are basically reading the EC2 tags directly from AWS using Boto 3 on the Salt master when a minion initially connects, and setting minion grains for those tags, instead of using the ec2_pillar at all.
