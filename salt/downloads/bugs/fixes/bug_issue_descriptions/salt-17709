The `mod_repo()` function tries to catch exceptions from `get_repo()` to determine if the PPA is installed. If it doesn't catch an exception, it assumes the PPA is installed, otherwise it shells out to `add-apt-repository` to add it.

The problem is that `get_repo()` doesn't throw an exception anymore, not since the 0.17 release. It just returns empty. This causes the `mod_repo()` function to never add new PPAs, and this in turn causes the `pkgrepo.managed` state to incorrectly report success when attempting to add new PPAs.
### Two Options:
1. Parse the the return of `get_repo()` rather than trying to catch its exceptions
2. Change `get_repo()` back to how it was in 2014.1 and throw an exception rather than returning empty.

I have a tested (on Ubuntu 12.04) patch for the 1st option that makes the `pkgrepo.managed` state work properly for me again. I've created PR #17712 with these changes.

This should only affect 2014.7.
