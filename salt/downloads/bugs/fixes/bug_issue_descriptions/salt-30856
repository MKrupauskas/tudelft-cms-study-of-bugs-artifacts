(Encountered in version 2015.8.3)

Hello!

I am running into an interesting issue using salt-ssh to execute custom modules relying on pillar data.

When querying for the target's pillar using: `salt-ssh '*' pillar.items` the custom pillar entries are present, however within a custom execution module the `__pillar__` entry only contains the default set of master pillar entries, none of the custom entries.

Checking the `pillar.json` that is deployed via salt-ssh to the target in `salt_state.tgz` the full pillar is visible.

The custom module that I have resulted to testing with whilst attempting to debug is:

```
def test():
    return __pillar__
```

Has anyone ran into anything similar? I can find some open issues regarding salt-ssh and pillars but most of these seem to be in regards to failing to render the pillar at all.
