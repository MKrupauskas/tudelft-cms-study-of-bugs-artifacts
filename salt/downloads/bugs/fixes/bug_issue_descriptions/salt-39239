### Description of Issue/Question
I have a service that I check to see if pkgs, a directory, and a file change. If any change I want to restart the service. I am doing this with salt-ssh. Using a watch works, but using a listen doesn't.

I wanted to switch to listen to avoid the order being changed.

### Setup
Example: 
```
{% from 'foo/map.jinja' import foo with context %}
 
foo_service:
  module.wait:
    - name: service.systemctl_reload
    - listen:
      - pkg: foo_pkgs
      - file: foo_init_file
  service.running:
    - name: {{ foo.service.name }}
    - enable: True
    - listen:
      - pkg: foo_pkgs
      - file: foo_config_dir
      - file: foo_init_file
 ```
 
Output: 
16:38:16   Name: foo_pkgs - Function: pkg.installed - Result: Changed Started: - 16:37:42.563045 Duration: 13448.689 ms
16:38:16   Name: foo - Function: service.running - Result: Clean Started: - 16:37:57.601214 Duration: 21.391 ms
