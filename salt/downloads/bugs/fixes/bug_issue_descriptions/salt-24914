Currently the failover code does not respect syndic setups.  A syndic can only point to one upstream master of masters at a time.  Ideally we would like to leverage the failover code so if an upstream master fails, the syndic will switch masters automatically like a normal minion can.

The workaround is to have the minion that runs on the syndic point to the same upstream master that is syndicating.  Then the master-of-masters can control the syndic and you can write a state to file.manage /etc/salt/master (or a file in /etc/salt/master.d) so you can manually switch the syndic.  You could also potentially write a reactor to do this.
