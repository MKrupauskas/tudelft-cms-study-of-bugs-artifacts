### Description of Issue/Question
The `ssh_known_hosts.present` state function does not support SH256-hashed public key fingerprints, which would be given by modern versions of OpenSSH binaries. For example:
```console
$ ssh-keyscan bitbucket.org | ssh-keygen -lf -
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-123
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-125
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-126
2048 SHA256:zzXQOXSRBEiUtuE8AikJYKwbHaxvSc0ojez9YXaGp1A bitbucket.org (RSA)
```
At the moment, I can't use such strong hash in SLS, but have to deal with legacy MD5:
```console
$ ssh-keyscan bitbucket.org | ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf -
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-123
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-132
# bitbucket.org:22 SSH-2.0-conker_1.0.284-7b46313 app-133
2048 MD5:97:8c:1b:f2:6f:14:6b:5c:3b:ec:aa:46:46:74:7c:40 bitbucket.org (RSA)
```
Also, this is little bit awkward that the option `-E md5` seems to be not documented properly and you need to remember how to extract proper fingerprint.

### Setup
```yaml
Authorize SSH host bitbucket.org:
  ssh_known_hosts.present:
    - name: bitbucket.org
    - enc: ssh-rsa
    - fingerprint: zzXQOXSRBEiUtuE8AikJYKwbHaxvSc0ojez9YXaGp1A
```

### Actual result
```yaml
----------
          ID: Authorize SSH host bitbucket.org
    Function: ssh_known_hosts.present
        Name: bitbucket.org
      Result: False
     Comment: Remote host public key found but its fingerprint does not match one you have provided
     Started: 10:41:59.213731
    Duration: 1000.601 ms
     Changes:   

```

### Expected result
The key has been added successfully.
