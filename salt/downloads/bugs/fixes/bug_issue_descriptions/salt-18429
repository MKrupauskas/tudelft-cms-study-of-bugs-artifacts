assuming a pillar containing:

```
settings:
  foo: 1
  buzz: 2
```

The following will result in the pillar 'settings:buzz' being undefined, whereas I'd expect it to be left intact and only the specific key to be overridden, or at least the pillar_source_merging_strategy to apply here as well:

```
salt '*' state.sls some.state pillar='{"settings":{"foo":"a"}}'
```

I believe the culprit is a line in: salt/state.py:State._gather_pillar():

```
ret.update(self._pillar_override)
```

which should be using Pillar.merge_sources() instead, in order to apply the pillar merge policy
