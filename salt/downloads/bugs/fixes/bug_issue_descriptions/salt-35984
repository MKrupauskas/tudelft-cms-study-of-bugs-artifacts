I try to copy a file from minion to master using:

`salt -l debug 'minion' cp.push /etc/issue`

And I get the following error: 

```
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1332, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/cp.py", line 799, in push
        load_path_list = os.path.split(load_path_split_drive)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 92, in split
        i = p.rfind('/') + 1
    AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'rfind'
```

Problem seems to be with the latest release 2016.3.3 , if I revert to 2016.3.2 it works properly.

Version used on minion:

```
dpkg -l | grep salt

ii  salt-common                    2016.3.3+ds-1             all          shared libraries that salt requires for all packages
ii  salt-minion                    2016.3.3+ds-1             all          client package for salt, the distributed remote execution system
```
