Some of the new boto tests in 2016.3 are causing the test suite to hang when run in succession. (They do not hang when run individually, but when the entire unit test suite runs, they hang.) These tests were disabled in #31955.

The issues with these tests need to be worked out so we can get these tests running again. More relevant discussion can be found in #31926 as well.
