Running the official vm-depot image as a master and the 2014.7.5 version of the client (on Windows). I've made a state to update the minion config. But I cant seem to get it out to my minion, it just says that the file was not found, even though I can copy it manually with the `cp` command.
## minion-config.sls

```
salt-minion:
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - watch:
      - file: C:/salt/conf/minion
  file.managed:
    - name: C:/salt/conf/minion
    - template: jinja
    - source:
      - salt://salt/config/minion.jinja
```
## show_sls on the minion

To check I have no stale cache stuff, I'm checking the minions idea of how the state should look and it seems correct.

```
[root@vmdepot-saltm saltpad]# salt 'dev-eu-iceb-01' state.show_sls salt.minion-config  -t 600
dev-eu-iceb-01:
    ----------
    salt-minion:
        ----------
        __env__:
            base
        __sls__:
            salt.minion-config
        file:
            |_
              ----------
              name:

              ----------
              order:
                  10001
        service:
            |_
              ----------
              enable:
                  True
            |_
              ----------
              watch:
                  |_
                    ----------
                    file:
                        C:/salt/conf/minion
            - running
            |_
              ----------
              order:
                  10000
```
## cp.get_file

To test so that the saltmaster actually have the file I do a cp.get_file which succeeds (green text returned and I've verified that the file gets copied to the minion).

```
[root@vmdepot-saltm saltpad]# salt 'dev-eu-iceb-01' cp.get_file salt://salt/config/minion.jinja  C:/dummy.txt
dev-eu-iceb-01:
    C:/dummy.txt
```
## state.sls

But, when I run the state...it says it can't find the file. I've enabled trace logging but it says nothing but this error.

```
[root@vmdepot-saltm saltpad]# salt 'dev-eu-iceb-01' state.sls salt.minion-config  -t 600
