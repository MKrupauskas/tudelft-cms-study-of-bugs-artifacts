### Description of Issue/Question

When I run dockerng.running in test=true it does things instead of saying that it would do things - it seems to download docker images for instead of just saying that it would do so.
Btw why does it download at all? I thought dockerng.image_present does this? Shouldnt dockerng.running fail if the image isnt present?

First run:

```
          ID: rancher_server_container
    Function: dockerng.running
        Name: rancher-server
      Result: None
