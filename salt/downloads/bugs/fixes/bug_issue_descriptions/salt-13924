We have a really awful package from IBM with the actual package name of: `gpfs.gplbin-2.6.32-279.31.1.el6.x86_64` for our cluster filesystem software. Since the package name (confirmed with `rpm --qf '%{NAME}\n' | grep gpfs`) actually includes x86_64, salt is unable to install it.

The relevant section of code (from a very quick cursory scan) is [somewhere around here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/pkg.py#L177) in `pkg._find_install_targets()`.
