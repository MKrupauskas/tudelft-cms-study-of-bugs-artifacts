I have a minion configured with the following /etc/salt/minion.d/beacon.conf:

```
# Initialize the wtmp beacon when the minion starts up

beacons:
  pkg:
    - pkgs:
        - bind9-host
        - sysdig
    - refresh:  True
  diskusage:
    - /var:  85%
```

My minion has new versions of bind9-host & sysdig available for upgrading and /var is used past 90%, but I do not see any events being sent by the beacons when i run `salt-run state.event pretty=True` on my master.  I've restarted salt-minion a bunch of times, and see no activity for these beacons in /var/log/salt/minion.   I'm not finding activity in the debug log on my salt-master either, but maybe I'm missing something since I'm not familiar w/the log data yet for this.   I can provide an excerpt of our debug log if useful.
