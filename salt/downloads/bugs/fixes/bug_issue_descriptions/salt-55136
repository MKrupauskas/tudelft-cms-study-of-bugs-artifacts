### Description of Issue
While testing 2019.2.2 I noticed that smartos_imgadm cannot deal with orphaned images due to them not having a 'name' key.

According to the SmartOS folks this should not happend unless you messed up with image creation. I'll try and write a fix for this to go into master.

### Setup
n/a

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Have a SmartOS node with a broken image, rather hard to do unfortunately.
