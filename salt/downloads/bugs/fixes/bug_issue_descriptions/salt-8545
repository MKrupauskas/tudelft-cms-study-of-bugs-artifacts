I'm running salt 0.17.1 on Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4.

When installing a package via salt, it seems the users associated with that package aren't installed. However, when I install the package with yum they are. Reinstalling the package also re-installs the user.

Here's my sls file:

```
httpd:
  pkg:
    - installed
  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
    - require:
      - pkg: httpd
```

In this case, the httpd rpm (and its dependencies) are installed, but the apache user and apache group are not. I can work around this by installing the user and group manually, but I don't understand why it's not pulled in with the package. Any suggestions for how to debug?
