### Description of Issue/Question

salt-call considers port number in minion config as part of the master hostname and fails to resolve it

suspect, that it was introduced by https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/8171c73b00868a1a135d20e201e6ec6e2230895f

Works fine on 2016.3.3

### Setup
/etc/salt/minion

master:
    - mysaltmaster.example.com:4506

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
with the above config:
salt-call test.ping
