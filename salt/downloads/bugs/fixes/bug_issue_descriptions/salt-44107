I have a virtualenv Salt setup which I use for salt-ssh, which works perfectly fine with Python 2. However, if I try to run it with Python 3, it fails. I'm running salt-ssh from a Debian 9 machine, the target machine is a Debian 8 machine with Python 3 installed.

```
$ salt-ssh odin test.ping
odin:
    ----------
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
        Traceback (most recent call last):

        ImportError: cannot import name 'Generator'
        
        During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

        ImportError: No module named 'backports_abc'
    stdout:
```

`sudo find /var/tmp/.salt_* -name backports_abc*` on the target system yields no results.

If I manually install backports_abc into the Salt virtualenv, it works again.
