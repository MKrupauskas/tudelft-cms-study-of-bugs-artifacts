Had a strange issue pop up.  I was running 2014.1.4.  I installed 2014.1.5 over the top of 2014.1.4 with a fresh checkout of v2014.1.5 from github using 'python setup.py install --force' and restarted the salt-master and salt-minion service.  

I spun up two new nodes on Digital Ocean using salt-cloud and attempted to manually set a grain using salt 'nginx*' grains.setval role webserver.

I received an error for both nodes indicating something to the affect of a malformed index, though unfortunately I didn't capture it exactly.  Afterwords the grains seemed to be corrupted as I received the same error when trying to apply a highstate.

I downgraded to 2014.1.4 and the error went away.  I upgraded to 2014.1.5 again this morning using the same method and have not been able to reproduce the error.

It sounds like it may have been a caching issue, but its difficult to say since I haven't been able to reproduce.  

Thank you,
-Mike
