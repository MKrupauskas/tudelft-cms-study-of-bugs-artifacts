### Description of Issue/Question
It appear that salt does not validate the grant and fail with a failed to execute.
The produced query is valid, i tested it in mysql, but the grant parser don't accept it

It would be helpfull to have this level of granulirity with privileges

### Setup

```
 mysql_grant_user:                              
   mysql_grants.present:                        
     - name: user
     - host: localhost                             
     - grant: "select (Column1,Column2)"                    
     - database: 'db.table'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use a per column grant, salt will produce the sql query : 
```
grant select (Column1,Column2) on db.table to user@localhost
```
But it don't valide it, and don't execute it as well.
