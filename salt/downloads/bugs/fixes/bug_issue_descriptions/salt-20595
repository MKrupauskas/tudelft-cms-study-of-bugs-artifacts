I am having problems with the kmod salt state I created for a Linux
module named with a dash '-' .

Originally, I had:

```
dm_multipath:
  kmod.present:
    - persist: True
```

But this gave me:

```
      ID: dm_multipath
Function: kmod.present
  Result: False
 Comment: Kernel module dm_multipath is unavailable
 Started:
Duration:
 Changes:  
```

So, looking at the kernel modules that were loaded on another machine:

```
$ lsmod |grep multipath
dm_multipath           18562  0
dm_mod                 85047  6 dm_multipath,dm_mirror,dm_log
```

Which corresponds with the file:

```
/lib/modules/2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64/kernel/drivers/md/dm-multipath.ko
```

I realized the weirdness that is "the Linux kernel modules subsystem",
which is that the files that have a dash ('-') in the name get listed
with the dash replaced with an underscore ('_').  So, since the module
was "unavailable", I changed the init.sls:

```
dm-multipath:
  kmod.present:
    - persist: True
```

And that worked:

```
      ID: dm-multipath
Function: kmod.present
  Result: True
 Comment: Loaded kernel module dm-multipath
 Started:
Duration:
 Changes:  
          ----------
          dm-multipath:
              loaded
          dm_multipath:
              loaded
```

(Notice that both the one with the dash and the one with the
underscore get checked.)

But I rerun, and get:

```
      ID: dm-multipath
Function: kmod.present
  Result: False
 Comment: Failed to load kernel module dm-multipath
 Started:
Duration:
 Changes:
```

So now, neither works:

```
      ID: dm_multipath
Function: kmod.present
  Result: False
 Comment: Kernel module dm_multipath is unavailable
 Started:
Duration:
 Changes:  

      ID: dm-multipath
Function: kmod.present
  Result: False
 Comment: Failed to load kernel module dm-multipath
 Started:
Duration:
 Changes:
```

There was a patch (#13239) that I guess is what gives the 2 "loaded"s
above.  But now, I either get an "unavailable" or an unloadable.  Also
possibly related:  #13240

I just looked at this again, and did an 'rmmod dm_multipath' before
calling the salt state, and the one with a dash worked, but the one
with the underscore failed.  My conclusion from this is that once the
above is fixed, in addition, 'kmod.present' needs to check if the
module is already loaded, and fail with a comment "already loaded" or
something like that.  Perhaps add a flag to unload then load, but not
allow that by default, because you wouldn't necessarily always want to
reload a kernel module.
