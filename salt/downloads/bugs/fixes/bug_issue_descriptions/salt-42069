### Description of Issue/Question
Nitrogen, `local_repo.p` file does not get created when running `spm update_repo`

### Setup
Setup SPM environment, create `/etc/salt/spm.repos.d/spm.repo` and add:
```
my_repo:
  url: file:///srv/spm_build
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run command `spm update_repo`.

The command seems to run fine but a `local_repo.d` file should get created in `/var/cache/salt/spm`.
