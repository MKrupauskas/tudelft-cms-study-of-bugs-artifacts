### Description of Issue
Someone contacted me via email that pdbedit module/state wasn't working.
The person is using samba 4.3.11 and the required fields in the pdbedit output are missing.

I was using samba 4.8.x when writing this module, there should probably be a version check that doesn't load the module when the version is older.

### Setup
N/a

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Try and use pdbedit module or state on samba older than 4.8.x
