### Description of Issue/Question
Can anyone please explain how to use the godaddy driver? I am trying for hours now and I think I already followed every howto and doc I found regarding libcloud_dns with godaddy.

Thank you very much.

### Setup
#### Config
/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/godaddy.conf

    my-godaddy:
      driver: 'godaddy'
      key: 'my-super-secret-key'
      secret: 'my-super-secret'
      shopper_id: 'some_digits'

#### state

    my-godaddy_testdomain.com:
      libcloud_dns.zone_present:
        - domain: 'testdomain.com'
        - profile: 'my-godaddy'
        - type: master

#### Error

    ----------
              ID: my-godaddy_testdomain.com
        Function: libcloud_dns.zone_present
          Result: False

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

    # salt-cloud --list-providers
    [WARNING ] The cloud driver, 'godaddy', configured under the 'my-godaddy' cloud provider alias, could not be loaded. Please check your provider configuration files and ensure all required dependencies are installed for the 'godaddy' driver.
    In rare cases, this could indicate the 'godaddy.get_configured_provider()' function could not be found.
    Removing 'godaddy' from the available providers list
    Error: There was an error listing providers: There are no cloud providers configured.
