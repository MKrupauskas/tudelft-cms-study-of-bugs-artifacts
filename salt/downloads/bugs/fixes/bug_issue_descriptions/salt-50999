### Description of Issue/Question
When virt-what exits with a code of 0 and an empty output ( which is valid according to the man page https://linux.die.net/man/1/virt-what ) an unhandled exception occurs as we try and split the output into a list and use the last line.

### Setup

Fresh develop branch install on machine that produces blank output for virt-what.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Fresh develop branch install and start on a machine that will give no output for the virt-what process.
