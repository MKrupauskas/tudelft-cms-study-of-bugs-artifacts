### Description of Issue/Question

The version 241 of systemd introduced recently on archlinux has a different output for its version. Because of this different output, systemd.py can't parse it correctly and therefore leads to `Unable to determine systemd version from systemctl ` from salt.

Output of `systemctl --version` on its latest version of archlinux : `systemd 241 (241.7-2-arch)`
`salt/utils/systemd.py:68` expects a version formatted like `systemd 241`
