### Description of Issue/Question
I have a formula that installs the Graylog repo package from its https source url. It worked fine until I upgraded Salt to 2017.7.0 this week.

### Setup

```
graylog.repo:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - graylog-2.2-repository: 'https://packages.graylog2.org/repo/packages/graylog-2.3-repository_latest.rpm'

```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Please use the docker container created to reproduce the issue.

`docker run -it danlsgiga/salt-pkg-http:2017.7.0
`

It returns with the following error but works just fine from curl or any browser:

```
