When I try to push a non-existent directory like so:

`salt 'minion-id' cp.push_dir /wqef`

Salt returns this:

`minion-id:
    True`

This is the same result I get for cases where the directory does exist. 

I tried the same thing with cp.push (for files instead of directories) and get the expected result (false for the case where the file doesn't exist). In all my test cases I was running salt from the master.
