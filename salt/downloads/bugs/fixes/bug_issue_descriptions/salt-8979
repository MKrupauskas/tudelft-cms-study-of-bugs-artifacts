The following example returns True on CentOS 6 , Fedora 19, Fedora 20 on i686 and x86_64 machines. However it will return False on a Fedora 20 Arm Machine (tested in a Qemu-arm VM and on a BeagleBone Black)

Example:

```
# salt 'arm-minion' pkg.check_db tmux

'arm-minion' :
    ----------
    tmux:
        ----------
        found:
            False
        suggestions:

```

Logging into the minion and running a yum install tmux is successful.

Interestingly enough a noarch package does not return anything and no errors are shown on the minion.

Using salt 0.17.2.

I dug into this when my "pkg.installed" states where failing and tried pkg.check_db.
