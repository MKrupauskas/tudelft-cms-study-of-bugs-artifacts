### Description of Issue/Question
Recently i upgraded Salt from version 2018.3.0 to 2019.2.0 and i noticed, that CPU usage of salt-master process is slowly rising and during 2 days it hits 100% of CPU load. It happens both on virtual and physical machines. It does this, no matter how many minions i have connected. Restarting service brings CPU load back to 0.

I am running on SLE 15.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install salt-master, run service.
