When running `pip install --install-option="--salt-transport=raet" salt`, pip seems to pull `pyzmq` as a dependency. Down the stream pip passes the `--salt-transport=raet` to the `setup.py install` of `pyzmq` causing the build to fail.

The reason I'm looking to use raet is because I thought I might test Salt on Cygwin and `pyzmq` won't compile on Cygwin. `pip install raet` completes just fine and thus there's hope! Also, since I'm targeting a standalone minion, I don't even need a transport, but it'd be nice to have for future.

Here's a complete log:
