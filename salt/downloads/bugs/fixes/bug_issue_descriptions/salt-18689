Affects Salt `2014.7.0` on Windows.

On Windows, some processes might not be accessible to the user running `salt-minion` such as system processes.

For example, the process `audiodg.exe` which is present on some Windows boxes is one of them and causes this backtrace, even when `pgrep`-ing for a completely different process:

```
$ salt MN1221-C0002 ps.pgrep firefox

MN1221-C0002:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "salt/minion.py", line 1019, in _thread_return
      File "salt/modules/ps.py", line 292, in pgrep
      File "salt/modules/ps.py", line 67, in _get_proc_name
      File "psutil/__init__.py", line 490, in name
      File "psutil/_pswindows.py", line 206, in wrapper
      File "psutil/_pswindows.py", line 241, in name
      File "psutil/_pswindows.py", line 213, in wrapper
    AccessDenied: (pid=18904)
```

The first thing to do to fix this, is to handle the `psutil.NoSuchProcess` exception in the `psutil.process_iter()` iteration in `ps.pgrep`, but some more work in other places might be needed as well.

I'm working on a fix and will provide a PR once I have a proper solution.
