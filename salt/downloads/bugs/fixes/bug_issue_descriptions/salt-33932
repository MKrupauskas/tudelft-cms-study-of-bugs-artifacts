### Description of Issue/Question

Hashing the global known hosts file (/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts), changes it's permissions to 600, making it unreadable by non-root processes. It's caused by ssh-keygen, which prior to creating the hashed known_hosts file, sets it's own umask to 077, something which isn't mentioned in it's documentation.
### Setup

No special setup required
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1.  create a state which adds an SSH pubkey to the global file using ssh_known_hosts.present, with hash_known_hosts set to True (default)
2. run highstate on a test host
3. compare file permissions of /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts created by ssh-keygen, and the original file /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.old on the testhost:

```
# ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts*
-rw------- 1 root root 4202 Jun 10 13:37 /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3286 Jun 10 13:37 /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.old
```
