Hello,

I have a Problem getting salt-ssh to work with AIX. 
We have several AIX Systems with different Versions and all of them have the same problem

salt version is one of
salt-ssh 2015.5.3 (Lithium) (ubuntu Package)
salt-ssh 2015.8.0-458-g0149038 (Beryllium) (GIT Checkout)

```
root@salt:/root > salt-ssh aixhost mount.active
aixhost:
    ----------
    retcode:
        1
    stderr:
        /bin/sh[14]: python3:  not found.
        /bin/sh[14]: python27:  not found.
        WARNING: Unable to locate current thin  version: /tmp/.root_3664b7_salt/version.
        Traceback (most recent call last):

            if os.path.islink(path):
          File "/usr/bin/../../opt/freeware/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 145, in islink
            return stat.S_ISLNK(st.st_mode)
          File "/usr/bin/../../opt/freeware/lib/python2.7/stat.py", line 56, in S_ISLNK
            return S_IFMT(mode) == S_IFLNK
        RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded    stdout:
        /usr/bin/scp
```

I found the same Issue in #25478, the Solution there is that the scp Binary is not installed which on my AIX Machine it is.

Copied the File over by hand without a problem like one commecnt said in: #25026

```
root@salt:/root > scp -o KbdInteractiveAuthentication=no -o PasswordAuthentication=yes -o GSSAPIAuthentication=no -o ConnectTimeout=65 -o Port=22 -o IdentityFile=/etc/salt/pki/master/ssh/salt-ssh.rsa -o User=root /var/cache/salt/master/thin/thin.tgz aixhost:/tmp/salt-thin.tgz
thin.tgz                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     100% 4185KB   4.1MB/s   00:00
```
