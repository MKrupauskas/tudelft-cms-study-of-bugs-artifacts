When using gitfs in production as a backend for states (and someday pillars), it would be very useful to not need to restart the master daemon every time a new commit is made to the git repository.

Right now one has to
1. rm -rf /var/cache/salt/master/gitfs/*
2. restart the master daemon

instead a command like "salt '*' master.gitrefresh" would be very handy.  Even better, in addition a refresh interval (e.g. every 5 minutes) as a configurable option would be hugely helpful, particularly in dynamic environments where state updates may happen several times a day, via git commits.
