### Description of Issue/Question

npm install is throwing an error when npm is version 5+/nodejs is version 8. I believe this is something to do with the `npm list --global --json` command

### Setup
```
nodejs_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: NodeJS Upstream
    - baseurl: https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub_8.x/el/7/$basearch
    # From https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub/el/NODESOURCE-GPG-SIGNING-KEY-EL
    - gpgkey: https://rpm.nodesource.com/pub/el/NODESOURCE-GPG-SIGNING-KEY-EL

nodejs:
  pkg.installed:
    - require:
      - pkgrepo: nodejs_repo

# Because node is installed in a different folder on local machines to servers.
# Alternative would be to have a different "location of node bin" parameter in each parameters.yml file.
/usr/local/bin/node:
  file.symlink:
    - target: /usr/bin/node

/usr/local/lib/node_modules:
  file.symlink:
    - target: /usr/lib/node_modules/

less@1.3.2:
  npm.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: nodejs
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I have the above state, which installs nodejs 8 (and therefore npm5), as well as setting some symlinks for us and installing a specific version of less (1.3.2).

When executed with salt this error is returned. All other states run fine, it's just the npm install that fails. It may be worth noting that this package is currently installed from before we upgraded to npm5/nodejs8.

I've attached the output of `npm list --json --global` which is what I understand it to be running. It's a bit long. I can't see a property name which is what I understand the deocder.py to be looking for.
