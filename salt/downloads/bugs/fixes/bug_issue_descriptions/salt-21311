Attempts to use external_auth ldap with TLS enabled on RHEL 6 causes a failure due to OS trusted CA info not being loaded by salt master:

```
CommandExecutionError: Failed to bind to LDAP server ldaps://server:636 as cn=user,dc=example,dc=com: {'info': "TLS error -8172:Peer's certificate issuer has been marked as not trusted by the user.", 'desc': "Can't contact LDAP server"}
```

Steps to reproduce:
- Configure ldap external_auth
- Start salt-master
- Attempt to run an authorized command.
- Output: above CommandExecutionError in DEBUG log, and user receives 'Failed to authenticate!'

Workaround:
Start salt-master manually with:
- `LDAPTLS_CACERT=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt salt-master`
- Commands work as expected.
