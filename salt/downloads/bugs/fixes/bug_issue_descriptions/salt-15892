New install on RHEL 6.5, [master log](http://pastebin.com/Lmz58q8d) shows nothing obvious (to me, but I'm a n00b).  Minions [hang trying to connect](http://pastebin.com/kJu8J408) (that one was on another machine, but the same thing happens with a minion on the master machine).  Even the `salt` command on the master hangs with the same problem.

Installing 2014.1.10 (with install_salt.sh or yum) fixes all these problems.  Re-installing 2014.7.0rc2 brings them back.
