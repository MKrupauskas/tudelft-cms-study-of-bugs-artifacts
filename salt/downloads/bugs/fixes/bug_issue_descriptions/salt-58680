**Description**
Hello,

While analyzing salt on SonarCloud I saw a comparison between incompatible types (dict and int) in [`salt/modules/consul.py`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/75bc0b70870e420b039334c974742dcc7fd4e4f7/salt/modules/consul.py#L1072). If executed it will raise a `TypeError`. You can see [the issue in SonarCloud here](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource_salt&issues=AXUIKzvLPoEr8CkZiQ7E&open=AXUIKzvLPoEr8CkZiQ7E).

Maybe the developer wanted to write instead
```
if len(check_dd) > 0:
```
Then I would recommend to replace it with a more pythonic
```
if check_dd:
```

**Setup**
There is no setup. This issue was detected by using the SonarCloud online service.
You can run the same analysis in a few clicks. I used [this configuration file](https://github.com/nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource/salt/commit/aec7a4ce1e0ecad066703cfa9fc5c48378e15a64) to separate properly main code from test code.

**Versions Report**
This issue was found directly on the master branch of salt. I didn't check if it was present in any released version.

**Additional context**
In case you have any question, suggestion or if you see a False Positive on SonarCloud you can reach out on [SonarSource community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).

A few notes in case you want to use SonarCloud:
* SonarCloud can easily import pylint and flake8 issues in case you want to use a rule SonarCloud does not already provide. Note however that if you select a rule already covered by SonarCloud you might see different issues than what Pylint/Flake8 report. We design our code analyzers to avoid False Positives as much as possible and to detect complex bugs.
* SonarCloud is free for open-source projects.
