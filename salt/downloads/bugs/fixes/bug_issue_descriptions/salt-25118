After updating from `2015.5.0` to `2015.5.2` the `rabbitmq_vhost` state is broken and throws an exception when a vhost is created:

```
          ID: rabbitmq_vhost_test
    Function: rabbitmq_vhost.present
        Name: rw
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1563, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/rabbitmq_vhost.py", line 84, in present
                  if any(user, owner, conf, write, read):

This is a known issue and has been fixed in #24524 (01c99ad7677991cee541f2e9da7a0751674d0fbb) almost a month ago but this one hasn't been backported.

That particular fix does indeed resolve it. After adding a patched `rabbitmq_vhost.py` to my `_states` my states are now executing just fine.
