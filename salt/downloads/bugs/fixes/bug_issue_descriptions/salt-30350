win_servermanager.py relies on the ServerManager powershell module.

The ServerManager module is only available on 64bit windows versions 2008R2 and higher.

If a user (for some horrible reason) has 32bit salt installed on 64bit Windows 2008R2 or higher, it will launch a 32bit powershell window which will not be able to find the ServerManager module and will return the following to the master:

A check should be made in the **virtual** function to check for versions higher than 2008R2 and 64bitness.
