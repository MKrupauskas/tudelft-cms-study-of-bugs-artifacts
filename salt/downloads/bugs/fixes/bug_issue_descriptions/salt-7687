After upgrading to 0.17.0 I wanted to use the hgfs fileserver backend and configured it in /etc/salt/master as follows:

```
fileserver_backend:
  - hg

hgfs_remotes:
  - /root/ops

hgfs_root: salt/sls

hgfs_branch_method: branches
```

Installed python-hglib through pip and restarted the salt master. /root/ops has a vanilla hg repository with a top.sls in salt/sls.

When I run highstate on any of my minions, I get the following error in the salt master debug output:

```
[ERROR   ] Error in function _master_opts:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/master.py", line 1444, in run_func
    ret = getattr(self, func)(load)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/master.py", line 891, in _master_opts
    envs = self._file_envs()
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/fileserver/__init__.py", line 153, in envs
    ret.update(self.servers[fstr]())
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/fileserver/hgfs.py", line 176, in envs
    tags = repo.get_tags()
AttributeError: 'hgclient' object has no attribute 'get_tags'
```

The same happens with a remote hg repository served over http.

I've looked through the code in hgfs.py, but can't really figure out why my repository would not have this function.

The problem is reproducible in a mint salt-sandbox environment from https://github.com/elasticdog/salt-sandbox.
