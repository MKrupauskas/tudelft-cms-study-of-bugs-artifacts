### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->
I notice unwanted parameter markers being added to the each of the elements when I read the pillar data to variables. The filter `|tojson` also does not help to clean it up. 

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
```
{% set appr = salt['pillar.get']('s_db:appro') %}

chk:
  file.managed:
  - name: /tmp/appr.txt
  - contents: |
      {{appr}}

[u"u'pravkul'", u"u'mehcel'", u"u'tgrill'"]

```
The same is noticed when I use `|tojson` also.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
