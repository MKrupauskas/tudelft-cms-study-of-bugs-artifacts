Python-zmq is listed as required, but not version 14.5 or greater, as is available in the Saltstack repo.  This works fine on new installs, as the Saltstack repo package will be chosen vs. epel.  On an upgrade though, from pre-Saltstack repo, the current 14.3 from epel will be used and doesn't provide what's needed for Salt to work correctly.  This should probably be corrected in the spec file so that upgrades work correctly.
