I was getting this error

The logs show:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'launchctl list -x nginx' in directory '/Users/sambev'
[ERROR   ] Command 'launchctl list -x nginx' failed with return code: 113
[ERROR   ] stderr: Could not find service "-x" in domain for system
```

After digging in I saw that the launchctl module's _get_launchctl_data has this:

``` python
def _get_launchctl_data(job_label, runas=None):
    cmd = 'launchctl list -x {0}'.format(job_label)
```

But `man launchctl` tells me:
-x       This flag is no longer supported.

I don't know if we can just remove the flag and not break older versions. 10.9 man page says:
If [-x] is specified, the information for the specified job is output as an XML property list.

But most plist files I know are all xml. Would be nice to hear from other OSX users.
