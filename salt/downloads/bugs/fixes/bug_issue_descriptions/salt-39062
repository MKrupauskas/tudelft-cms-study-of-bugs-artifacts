### Description of Issue/Question
Attempting to import_yml an empty defaults.yml and then use as a pillar.get override throws an error in 2016.11.2.

For example, a state created with something like the following (our state/formula cookie-cutter does this for every state we create):

```
{% import_yaml 'path/to/formula/defaults.yml' as formula_defaults -%}
{% from 'path/to/formula/map.jinja' import formula with context %}

{% set formula_settings = salt['pillar.get']('formula:pillar', default=formula_defaults, merge=True) -%}
```

Starting with 2016.11.2, when using the above setup, if the defaults.yml is empty, the following error is now thrown:
```
Problem running salt function in Jinja template: default must be a dictionary when merge=True
```
Oddly (at least to me), state.show_sls does not throw an error.

Perhaps this is to be expected (which is fine), but had functioned previously.  The workaround is to put something in the defaults.yml:

```
empty_defaults: True
```

### Setup
Create a state using the defaults/pillar override block as described above, leave defaults.yml empty.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
attempt to apply state created as described

### Versions Report
Issue seen on RHEL6/7 and CentOS 7
