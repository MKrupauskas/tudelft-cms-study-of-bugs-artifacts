Problem Analysis:

A 'rev' value is added to the opts list in the states/svn.py file in method svn.export. This list is then used in the corresponding modules/svn.py svn.export method to fill up the missing revision argument which has been introduced some point of time. This way, one of the opts parameters is taken as argument for the revision argument in the svn.export implementation.

There is no work around.

I already have a patch for that.
