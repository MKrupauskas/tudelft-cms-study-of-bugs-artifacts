If you have an existing user `example` with home set to `/home/wrong`
Specifying the following in the state file:

```
example:
    user.present:
       - fullname: Example
       - shell: /bin/zsh
       - home: /home/example
```

I can't really determine if it is a bug or a feature, since the state's name is `present`. How ever, if I consider that this state completely adds a user to systems where it does not exists, I would also say it should be that case that the state should modify systems to correspond with the state describe in the yaml. 

Hence, this might be a bug or a feature request.
I would appreciate your feedback.
