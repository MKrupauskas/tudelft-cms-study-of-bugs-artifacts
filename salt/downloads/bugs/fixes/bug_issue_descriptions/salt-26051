When running the test suite with `--transport tcp` and `-m` on the HEAD of the 2015.8 branch, some troubling slowdowns begin to occur midway through the test run, eventually slowing to 5+ seconds between tests, with some failing. These slowdowns and failures do not occur with the ZeroMQ tests.

When tailing '/tmp/salt-runtests.log`, this type of error begins to become very frequent around the time the tests begin to slow: 

```
14:45:02,558 [salt.minion                             :1272][WARNING ] The minion failed to return the job information for job 20150805144402014451. This is often due to the master being shut down or overloaded. If the master is running consider increasing the worker_threads value.
```

By default, the test runner starts up a master with `worker_threads: 3`. (As specified in `salt/tests/integration/files/conf/master`. However, any attempt to increase the number of threads beyond three seems to prevent the minions from connecting initally at all, and thusly, the test suite does not even run. It simply hangs for two minutes prior to the module and state sync and then times out and exits.

I have attempted to adjust the value of the `backlog` variable up from 5 (which does not seem to be supported by *NIX systems) and downward toward zero. Moving it upward has no effect and moving it downwards seems to make the above warning message appear earlier and more frequently, though this is only a casual observation.

At present, the slowdowns are siginficant enough to prevent the entire test suite from completing in under three hours, while the ZeroMQ side takes about twenty-five to thirty minutes.

No performance degredation is observed when simply using Salt via the CLI.
