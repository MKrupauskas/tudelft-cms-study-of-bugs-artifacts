I've declared an EC2  EBS volume in a cloud profile that is to be created from an existing snapshot. I've also specified that I want it to be a GP2 (SSD) volume:

```
volumes:
    - { device: /dev/sdf, type: gp2, snapshot: snap-63380d10 } 
```

The volume is created, but it is always a 'standard' magnetic volume, not the gp2 SSD volume that was requested.
