Hi all,

The main idea is the possibility to redefine the variables used in a defaults.yaml file in the pillar.sls.

I create the following example for a sysctl formula: 

https://gist.github.com/dseira/1adfedf28503fa0ae4c6

With that functionality you can manage the next case:

You define all the default sysctl params in the defaults.yml and, then for every server you can overwrite some params needed.

An example (pseudocode):

In the defaults.yml:

``` yaml
net.ipv4_forward:0
kernel.sysrq:0
```

In the pillar:

``` yaml
if server1:
    net.ipv4_forward:1
```

In that case, when the state is applied, the server1 should have the next params:

``` yaml
net.ipv4_forward:1
kernel.sysrq: 0
```

Or, if the server2 is not defined in the pillar, it takes the defaults:

``` yaml
net.ipv4_forward:0
kernel.sysrq:0
```

This would be nice because the pillar file would be shorter than having to put all the same params for every server in the pillar; all the common params would be in the defaults.yaml.
