### Description of Issue/Question

An existing proxy minion is unable to start due to a wrong cast in the grains. 

In ```/etc/salt/proxy.d/_schedule.conf```:

```yaml
osrelease_info: !!python/tuple [proxy]
```

Additionally, this does not seem to be a particular case, as other grains were not cast to string (as before). Did that change recently in Carbon?
If so, I think a fix would be very recommended to be included in ```2016.11.1``` - I will look into it and try to understand how it works. I will also need to cast the unicode bits from the [napalm grains](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/grains/napalm.py) to string types, e.g.: ```serial: !!python/unicode 'T2405'```.

This is not a problem only for myself, I'm pretty sure it broke few other things (especially in proxy minions).

After correcting  ```/etc/salt/proxy.d/_schedule.conf``` to ```osrelease_info: proxy``` it worked fine.
