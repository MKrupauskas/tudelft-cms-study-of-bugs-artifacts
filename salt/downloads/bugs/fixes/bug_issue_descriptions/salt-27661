According to the docker-py 1.4 API documentation, providing arguments to `client.start` is decrecated. These arguments should be provided to the create method instead. This follows from a similiar change in the Docker API 1.15. We're now at 1.20 so it's high time to switch. 

A consequence of using the deprecated API is that you can't provide LogConfig arguments to docker. The reason is that the only way to provide this with docker-py is in the `host_config` provided to `client.create` however, the `host_config` given to `client.start` overrides these. 

```
Deprecation warning: For API version > 1.15, it is highly recommended to provide host config options in the host_config parameter of create_container
```
