About half of the time when I run my salt-ssh command to update my servers, I am rewarded with these type of errors:

frontend-prod002:

```
    An Exception occurred while executing state.highstate: [Errno 17] File exists: '/Users/phpdave11/code/salt/cache/master/roots/hash/base'
```

backend-prod004:

```
    An Exception occurred while executing state.highstate: [Errno 17] File exists: '/Users/phpdave11/code/salt/cache/master/files/base/mysql'
```

Here's my salt-ssh command:

```
    salt-ssh --log-level=info --config-dir=/Users/phpdave11/code/salt/bin/../config \
    --roster-file=/Users/phpdave11/code/salt/bin/../config/roster.d/phpdave11-prod \
    \*prod\* state.highstate
```

This was happening in 2014.7, and I recently upgraded to 2015.5 but I still see the same thing.
