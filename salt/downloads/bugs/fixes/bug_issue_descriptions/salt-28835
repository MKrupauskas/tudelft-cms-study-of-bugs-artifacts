I just found out that the following snippet will fail:

```
rsyslogd:
  user.present:
    - fullname: Rsyslogd user, salt created
    - shell: /bin/sh
    - home: /srv/logs/
    - system: True
```

Since the fullname contains a comma, applying this state several time result into this:

```
rsyslogd:x:994:992:Rsyslogd user, salt created, salt created, salt created, salt created, salt created,,,:/srv/logs/:/bin/sh
```

I assume that fullname should be checked for ',' since this is used as a separator.

```
