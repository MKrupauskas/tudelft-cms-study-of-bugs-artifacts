### Description of Issue/Question

We create users and set passwords for them in a similar way in Linux, MacOS and FreeBSD (with adjusted `$HOME` dirs and `bash` paths), but all our user states fail to set a password on the OpenBSD minion. 

The docs mention setting a password for a user should work in OpenBSD too: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.user.html

### Setup
The following state fails in OpenBSD:
```
dev-account:
  user.present:
    - name: 'dev'
    - fullname: 'Developer Account'
    - shell: '/usr/local/bin/bash'
    - home: '/home/dev/'
    - password: '$1$yKL7JOOJ$cKD684neV2MTj6MZ1mdI70'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply the above state to an OpenBSD minion. On the first run, you get:
```
          ID: dev-account                                                                                                                                   
    Function: user.present                                             
        Name: dev                                                               
      Result: False

I think this failed in 5.8 and 5.9 too, judging by how old our workaround  for OpenBSD in our state is. But I don't have an installation to re-test.
