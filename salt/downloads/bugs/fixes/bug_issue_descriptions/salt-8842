Randomly salt stopped working. I restarted the master and local minion to no avail. (All minions were failing to receive commands, not just the local minion but my testing was primarily done with the local minion)

I eventually managed to fix it after numerous restarts by restarting every minion, removing the /var/cache/salt/master/jobs directory and restarting the master.

I am not sure if what fixed it was restarting of all other minions (ie, if one of the minions was in a bad state which was making the master crap out) or if nuking the cache/salt/master/jobs directory is what resolved it as I had done both at the same time (I was getting a little desperate at that point).

Logs didn't reveal anything of interest in either the master or minion even with the logging level set to trace.

Plenty of disk space and memory was available.
