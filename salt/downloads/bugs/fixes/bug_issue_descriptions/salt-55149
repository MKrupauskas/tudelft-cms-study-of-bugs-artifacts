I have the following pillar setup following instructions 
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/2018.3/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.match.html

It has been working well for two years until I upgrade salt to 2019.2.2 today.
```
{% set region = grains['id'].split('.')[0] %}
region: {{ region }}
{% load_yaml as role_defs %}
web:
  - region1.minion1
  - region1.minion2
zabbix-agent:
  - "G@os:FreeBSD"
{% endload %}
{% set roles = salt.match.search_by(role_defs) or [] %}
role: {{ roles | yaml() }}
rr: [{{ region  }}.{{ roles | join(', ' ~ region ~ '.' ) }}]
```

For example, if I run
`salt region1.minion1 pillar.get role`, it used to give a list 
```
- web
- zabbix-agent
```
but now it gives only one
```
- zabbix-agent
```
This is happening to all my minions. And my highstate is based on `role`, which means everything is broken now.
