### Description of Issue
When using the `archive` function to perform any operation that requires listing the contents of a simple tar archive (including `archive.list` and the `archive.extracted`state, and probably others), Salt doesn't actually use the command specified in the `options` parameter, even if the python tarfile module fails to read the file.

### Setup
Salt 2019.2.0 on Linux

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create a tar archive that the python `tarfile` module can't read (for example with `maven-assembly-plugin` version 2.3).
2. Try to list the contents of the file using the `tar` command (`tar -tvf /path/to/file.tar`); this succeeds.
3. Try to list the contents of the file using Salt (`salt-call --local archive.list /path/to/file.tar`); this fails because python's `tarfile` module can't read the file. Fair enough.
4. Try to read the file using the `options` parameter (`salt-call --local archive.list /path/to/file.tar options="tar -tvf"`); this also fails, and Salt doesn't even *try* to use the `tar` command.
