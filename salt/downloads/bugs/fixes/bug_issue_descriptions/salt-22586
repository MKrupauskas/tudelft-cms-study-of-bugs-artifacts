Hello,

When I run my state with function "mount.mounted" the result is: "Umount: Forced unmount because options (*) changed"
If I remove nonempty opts, the result is the same with the last opts..

I thinks it's a bug, but maybe I misconfigured parameter..
Can you help me please ? I don't want forced remout if this alredy mounted !

**State:**

> /mnt/box:
>  mount.mounted:
> - device: root@box.server.com:/
> - fstype: fuse.sshfs
> - opts:
>   - port=2222
>   - rw
>   - reconnect
>   - allow_other
>   - transform_symlinks
>   - nonempty
>   - _netdev
> - persist: true
> - mkmnt: true
> - pass_num: 2
> - require:
>   - pkg: sshfs
>   - sls: ssh.known_hosts

**Result:**

> ID: /mnt/box
> Function: mount.mounted
>  Result: mount: according to mtab, root@box.server.com:/ is already mounted on /mnt/box
> Comment: Target was already mounted. Entry already exists in the fstab.
