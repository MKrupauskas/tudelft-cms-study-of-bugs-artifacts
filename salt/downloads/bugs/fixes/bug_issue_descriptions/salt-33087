### Description of Issue/Question

In a state file, if I try to clone a git repo (using `git.latest` state function) passing in a specific tag or commit sha1 I'll get incorrect behavior from the git state module. If a clone is required, it will call `git clone` without any `--branch` option, effectively ignoring the `rev` argument (but taking `depth` into account). This should not be a problem if a full clone is made, but if `depth` is given to `git.latest`, the git clone command will use `--depth`, making a shallow clone of the remote's current HEAD (usually master). After shallow cloning the remote HEAD, `git.latest` tries to checkout the given revision and fails because we only have one completely unrelated commit in our local repo, and our local set of tags may also be incomplete.

I suppose this problem goes back to much earlier versions of salt, and I see it's still not correct in 2016.3. I am willing to submit a fix if this bug report gets accepted, but I have no idea which branch I should fork. Please let me know if you're interested in a fix and I can take care of it.
(btw, over 1K sloc in a single python function?!?)
### Setup

SLS file "scratch.sls":

```
clone_specific_rev:
  git.latest:
    - name: https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git
    - target: /home/vagrant/salt
    - rev: v2015.8.0
    - depth: 1
    - user: vagrant
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Output:

```
root@salt:/home/vagrant# salt-ssh remote state.apply scratch
remote:

          ID: clone_specific_rev
    Function: git.latest
        Name: https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git
      Result: False
     Comment: Revision 'v2015.8.0' does not exist in clone
