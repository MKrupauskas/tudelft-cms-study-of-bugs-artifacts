SPM log file not getting created in /var/log/salt/spm. Documentation says a log file should be getting created in /var/log/salt/spm: `https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/spm/#spm-logfile`

Maybe a config setting somewhere turns it on, but not aware of it. I get the impression from the doc that anything SPM does should get logged. Maybe it's only errors or warnings that get logged, not sure.
