************* Module salt.modules.grains
salt/modules/grains.py:228: [W0631(undefined-loop-variable), setvals] Using possibly undefined loop variable 'key'
salt/modules/grains.py:228: [W0631(undefined-loop-variable), setvals] Using possibly undefined loop variable 'val'
```

And `key` & `val` just seem to be the last pair from the earlier loop, so I don't understand what the purpose of this assignment is.
