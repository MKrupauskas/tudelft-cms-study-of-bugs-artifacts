**Description**
I get the following warnings once a minute:

2020-06-23 23:11:13,900 [salt.loaded.int.fileserver.roots:180 ][WARNING ][24993] Skipped invalid cache mtime entry in /var/cache/salt/master/roots/mtime_map: /srv/salt/a/b/c/ifcfg-eth0:0:1533517049.0

**Setup**
Just name a file under /srv/salt using a colon somewhere in the filename.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Just name a file under /srv/salt using a colon somewhere in the filename.

**Expected behavior**
Only real warnings about invalid cache mtime entries should be emitted, not spurious ones that are due to a bug in the code that incorrectly parses the line.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
The problem is pretty easy to spot in the code, and I think also pretty easy to fix. The issue is on line 170 in salt.loaded.int.fileserver.roots (version 3001):

file_path, mtime = line.replace("\n", "").split(":", 1)

When a file path has a colon, the operation barfs because it splits in the wrong place. Just try it on the examples above. The solution is to replace the split method with rsplit or rpartition.

I'm happy to have someone make the change, or also happy to contribute the fix if that's easier (if so, how do I do that? I'm familiar with Python, but not github for pull requests).
