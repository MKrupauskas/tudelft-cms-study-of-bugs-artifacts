When using the following state:
```
auth_type:
  ini.options_present:
    - name: /path/to/file
    - sections:
        pgbouncer:
          auth_type: something
          auth_file: /another/path
```
Everything works fine when there is a change to make.  On the next run, however, when there is nothing to change, it throws an exception:
```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
