I started writing a new test called `test_parse_zone` in tests/unit/modules/dnsutil_test to test the `parse_zone` functionality in salt/modules/dnsutil and the function is giving an index error on the mock dns file that I am passing into the test. 

I got the dns zone file from http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO-7.html in section 7.3. 

@techhat can you take a look at the parse_zone function? See pull req #10539.
