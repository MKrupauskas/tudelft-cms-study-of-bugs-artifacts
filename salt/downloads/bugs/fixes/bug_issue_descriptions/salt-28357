While implementing a custom returner to get #27591 to work without the jid. I added a modified copy of carbon_return.py to _returners synced etc. But when switching in the `event_return: carbon` to my `event_return: carbon_event` returner the master does not seem to find it. 

On top of that it fills up disk space _really_ quickly since the master log is filled with the raw data followed by `Returner 'carbon_event' not found.`, maybe that log should not contain the raw data.
