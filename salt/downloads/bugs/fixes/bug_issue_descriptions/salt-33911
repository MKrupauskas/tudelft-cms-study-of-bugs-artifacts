### Description of Issue/Question

Using `salt['grains.filter_by']()` over salt-ssh goes via this supposed wrapper [/client/ssh/wrapper/grains.py#L141](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/000de9597475afa59b0cd6c7c1f6c3dc1c66a0bc/salt/client/ssh/wrapper/grains.py#L141) -- which indeed has no 'base' kwarg.

One can see none of the other functions are wrappers either, but a copy-paste made some time ago that diverged from new developments.

Ironically, using `salt['grains'].filter_by()` or `salt.grains.filter_by()` does not go through the wrapper and works just fine.
### Setup

example.sls

```
{% set test = salt['grains.filter_by']({
    'default': {'foo': 'bar'},
}, base='default') %}

test-it:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/{{ test.foo }}

```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use the above snippet over salt-ssh.
