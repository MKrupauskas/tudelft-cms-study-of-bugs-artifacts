```
salt '*' disk.usage
minion:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 659, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/disk.py", line 71, in usage
        while not comps[1].isdigit():
    IndexError: list index out of range
```

The output of the `df` command is special because I am inside a docker. Consequently inside the container `df` returns `df: cannot read table of mounted file systems: No such file or directory`

This is quite a special case but I guess there is a better way to handle such exception.

OS: CentOS 6.4
Both minion and master have the same salt version:
