[According to the docs here](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/file_server/dynamic-modules.html#sync-via-states) the dynamic modules should be autoloaded when a state is run if `autoload_dynamic_modules` is True. But when I run `salt '*' state.high_state` on the master my python modules in `salt/_modules` and `salt/_states` are not copied. The same applies to `salt-call state.highstate` on the minion. When I do a `salt '*' saltutil.sync_all` before, the modules and states are found and work correctly.

I've verified the `autoload_dynamic_modules` is turned on with `salt '*' test.get_opts`.

The master and minion both have 0.15.3.
