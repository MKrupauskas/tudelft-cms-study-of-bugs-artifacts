This is on an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Salt 0.17.2.

On the first run:

Subsequent runs (at this point I isolated the states from a full highstate run to a single SLS file):

``` bash

The SLS file:

``` yaml
libvirt:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - pkgs:
        - libvirt-bin
        - libvirt0
  libvirt:
    - keys
    - require:
      - pkg: libvirt
```

I cannot investigate this further at this time (time and priority constraints).
