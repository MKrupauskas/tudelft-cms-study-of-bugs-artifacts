### Description of Issue/Question

`docker.container_running state` does not use the supplied `ipv6_address` if a custom `network_mode` is used.

### Setup
```sls
mynet:
  docker_network.present:
    - enable_ipv6: True
    - ipam_pools:
      - subnet: 10.0.20.0/24
        gateway: 10.0.20.1
      - subnet: fe3f:2180:26:1::/64
        gateway: fe3f:2180:26:1::1

test:
  docker_container.running:
    - image: busybox:latest
    - rm: true
    - detach: True
    - command: sleep 60000
    - network_mode: mynet
    - networks:
      - mynet:
        - ipv4_address: 10.0.20.50
        - ipv6_address: fe3f:2180:26:1::50
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the above state. Run docker inspect test and notice that the addresses for the mynet connection are not the requested addresses. This fails when specifying both ipv4 and ipv6 or just ipv4 or just ipv6.

If you do not specify `network_mode`, the requested address is assigned, but the container is attached to both `mynet` and the default `bridge` network.
