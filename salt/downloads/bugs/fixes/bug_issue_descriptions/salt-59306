**Description**

This is a second-hand report against 3000.4 on Sparc 11.

With a state like:

```sls
Salt Minion | Installed:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: salt-minion
    - version: 3000.4,5.11:20200825T201511Z
```

... an already-installed version doesn't appear to be matched as the version comparison involves a one-item list with the version string vs the version string only:

```text
