When installing global NPM modules, the salt script runs "npm list --silent --json --global" for every global package. This is not needed - this function takes rather long and if only called once will speed up the process. I'm not sure if this can be fixed properly, but calling it once and caching it would speed up the total process quite a lot - allthough i understand if it _needs_ to be called, but well. Just checking :)
