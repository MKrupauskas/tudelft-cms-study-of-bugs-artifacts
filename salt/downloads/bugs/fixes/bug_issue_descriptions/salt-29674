I've got 8 salt masters running in pairs for redundancy. So 4 groups handling roughly 500-600 servers each. Every few days the masters will hang. They both hang at the same time and requires a restart to help clear things up.

I have the minions run a highstate every 30 min. If I used the documented highstate schedule (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/schedule.html#highstates) things would blow up so I'm using a simple schedule cmd.run. I'm also running a cleanup script from the masters every 30 minutes to clean out stale minions.

The command I'm running to clear out stale minions is:

```
salt --out txt "*" test.ping | grep "Not connected" | cut -d ":" -f 1 | xargs -I dead_minion salt-key -y -d dead_minion
```

I did test out `salt-run manage.down removekeys=True` but it didn't seem to work as well.

I'm not seeing any issues with minions being removed per se.. but I am seeing salt master hanging. So when new boxes come online they aren't provisioned properly.

I"m seeing errors in the that seem to suggest that an internal minion check is failing miserably. The log is below.

I'm also seeing endless logs about the "bad load from minion" even after I ping out to all the minions.

The multi-master setup I'm using is:
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster.html

Would this be better?
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster_pki.html

Ideally having two hot is great but if it causes issues then obviously I'll back off of it.

Any help in determining the core issue would be much appreciated.

Thanks!
