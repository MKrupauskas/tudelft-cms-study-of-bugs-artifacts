### Description of Issue
`grains.virtual` unconditionally returns "LDOM" on Oracle solaris, regardless of whether the system is running in LDOM, on bare metal, in VMWare, etc.

### Setup
No special setup required

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt myhostname grains.get virtual`

### Versions Report
2019.2.0

### Analysis
The bug was introduced by f7f8a8ff1fc0841171cdfda99b5c51e465db65fd .  As you can see from the diff, the virtual grain now returns "LDOM" as long as the `virtinfo` command exists.  It doesn't attempt to interpret `virtinfo`'s output at all.
