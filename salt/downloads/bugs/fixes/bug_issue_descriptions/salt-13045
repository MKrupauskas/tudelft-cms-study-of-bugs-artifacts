We're trying to create a pipe `fcgi.sock`.

Salt state we specified is:

```
/var/run/myapp/fcgi.sock:
  file.mknod:
    - user: www-data
    - group: www-data
    - mode: 660
    - ntype: p
```

The first time the state runs it creates this socket correctly, but on subsequent runs it fails with the error:

`File /var/run/myapp/fcgi.sock exists and cannot be overwritten`

despite the fact it should succeed, since the permissions for `fcgi.sock` are:

`srw-rw----  1 www-data www-data    0 May 22 10:39 fcgi.sock`
