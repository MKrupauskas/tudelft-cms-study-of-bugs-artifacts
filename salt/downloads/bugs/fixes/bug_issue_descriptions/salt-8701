I set up a scenario like the image below.

![syndicerror](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/306240/1586571/8c2401ec-522a-11e3-98a8-69131c31a314.png)

Each salt-master has 2 minions below it with properly accepted keys. The syndics also have salt-minion installed and connected to the master directly above it.

When I run 'salt * test.ping' from the master master I only get responses from its 2 minions directly below it and the minion running on the syndic below it. If I stop the minion service on the syndic, then the minions below the syndic respond to commands from the mastermaster.
