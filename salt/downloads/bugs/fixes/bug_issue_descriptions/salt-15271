As I described in #14976, I'm writing a script that does package upgrades in my environment. I'd like my script to know which hosts have successfully upgraded packages, so it can determine if a host needs a reboot or not.

Often the number of packages to be updated means the pkg.upgrade job times out, and my script doesn't get a return value with what happened. Can we add a timeout parameter to the salt/modules/aptpkg.py upgrade method, which is passed to the subsequent cmd.run (and perhaps do similar changes to all the other upgrade() methods that implement pkg.upgrade?)
