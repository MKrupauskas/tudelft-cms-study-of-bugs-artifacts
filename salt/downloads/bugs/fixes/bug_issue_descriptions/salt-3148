On 0.11.1 running under Vagrant/CentOS 6.3, the following complete immediately:

```
salt '*' test.ping
salt db.vm test.ping
salt db.\* test.ping
```

However this command hangs for around 12 seconds before returning to the shell:

```
salt -N db test.ping
```

Lowering the timeout decreases the total hang time to around 4 seconds, so it looks like something is timing out, with retries:

```
salt -t1 -N db test.ping
```

Nothing is reported to the console. -v shows me nothing.
