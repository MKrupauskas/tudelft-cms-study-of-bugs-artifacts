I have tested this on the following salt versions:
2015.5.6, 2015.8.0, 2015.8.1

I have the following sls file:

```
highstateschedule:
  schedule.present:
    - name: master_highstate_schedule
    - seconds: 900
    - function: saltutil.cmd
    - job_args:
      - tgt: '*'
      - fun: state.highstate
      - timeout: 600
```

When I run `salt '*' state.sls highstateschedule` initially i receive the expected output as shown below:

```

When I attempt to run it a second time this is the output I receive:

It seems it is trying to add the schedule a second time and does not check to see if its already set. 

Just as a reference this is the expected output which worked on 2015.5.2:

```
ch3ll-centos:

          ID: highstateschedule
    Function: schedule.present
        Name: master_highstate_schedule
