I use a grain to set an environment on my minions in the /etc/salt/minion but would like to start using /etc/salt/grains as its easier to manage.

I use the following environmental value in many of my states to determine which files to place in which environment like so.

``` jinja
{% set environment = salt['grains.get']('env', '') %}
```

If I remove the grains for env from /etc/salt/minion and add it to the /etc/salt/grains it breaks all my file.managed source paths as its expecting a list indicated by the ['sys'] instead of a single value when using the /etc/salt/grains. Perhaps I am setting the value wrong but I would expect the same behavior from both files which is not the case. Let me know if there is a workaround.

Output::
