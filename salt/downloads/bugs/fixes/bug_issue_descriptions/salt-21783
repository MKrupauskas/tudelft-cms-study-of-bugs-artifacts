Salt is failing `ssh_auth.present` on a `2014.7.2` box. The same state works fine on a `2014.7.1` box. Permissions seem fine, and the error happens whether `/home/garthk/.ssh/authorized_keys` is present or absent. 

```
root@hostname:/home/garthk# salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2014.7.2 (Helium)

I can't easily downgrade: `2014.7.1` is gone from the repo. Any ideas? 

UPDATE: **WORKAROUND:** ensure your SSH keys have a comment.
