### Description of Issue/Question

The following state is waiting forever for a confirmation:

```
Disable_modules:
  apache_module.disabled:
    - name: autoindex 
```

Because when I ran the command manualy:

```
~$ sudo /usr/sbin/a2dismod autoindex
WARNING: The following essential module will be disabled.
This might result in unexpected behavior and should NOT be done
unless you know exactly what you are doing!
 autoindex

To continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!' or retry by passing '-f':
```

The apache_module state would require a 'force' parameter to prevent this. Or run the relevant command with the -f by default.
