**Description**
MacOS `service.running` is not robust.  Testing https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/salt-formula/pull/447  I only managed to get `com.saltstack.salt.master` success once, every other attempt returns-

1. `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.saltstack.salt.master.plist: service already loaded`
2. `Service com.saltstack.salt.master is already enabled, and is dead`
3. `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.saltstack.salt.master.plist: Service is disabled`

**Setup**
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (be sure to remove sensitive info).
