### Description of Issue/Question
On 2017.7.2 py3 setup, state.highstate fails when having this in the minion config file:
```
use_superseded:
  - module.run
```
It affects all state.highstate runs even if not using the module.run state.

It also affects 2017.7.0/7.1.

It is working correctly on a py2 setup.

I just get `minion did not return` and see this in the minion log:
```
