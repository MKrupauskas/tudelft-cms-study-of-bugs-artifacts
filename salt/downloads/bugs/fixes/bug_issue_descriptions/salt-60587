**Description**
The PR https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/60514 and PR https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/60533 where merged close together (within hours of each other), however the new pytest test_core.py needs to intgrate the changes from PR  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/60514 into it.

They were like ships in the night passing each other.  Hence need to update the new pytest grains/test_core.py with the recent changes from the older unit test based grains/test_core.py.
