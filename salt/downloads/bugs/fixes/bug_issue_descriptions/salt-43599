### Description of Issue/Question

Creating a new salt.cache.Cache object using an `opts` argument which does not define a `cache` tag will trigger the default of the `get` at salt/cache/__init__.py around line 76 which says:
` self.driver = opts.get('cache', salt.config.DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS)`

This returns the entire DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS dictionary, which is clearly not correct.

I suspect that the intention is to use:
` self.driver = opts.get('cache', salt.config.DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS['cache'])` which contains the value `localfs`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try creating a salt.cache.Cache(__opts__) object while using a Mocked __opts__ which is missing `cache`. 

### Versions Report

Is present in latest `develop` branch commit as of this writing. 054f7c95519db6f33ea0498caebd6eb6de0be73c

(I am debugging a different branch)...
