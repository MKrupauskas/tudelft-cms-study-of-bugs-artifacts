Hi. It actually installed just fine but when I run it, it complains that it cant find something:

```
[ Apr  1 12:56:30 Executing start method ("/var/opt/csw/svc/method/svc-salt-minion start") ]
/var/opt/csw/svc/method/svc-salt-minion: /opt/csw/bin/salt-minion: not found
[ Apr  1 12:56:30 Method "start" exited with status 1 ]
```

the file is there and when I try to run it like this I get another not found:

```
-bash-3.00# /opt/csw/bin/salt-minion  -d -c /etc/opt/csw/salt/
-bash: /opt/csw/bin/salt-minion: /opt/csw/bin/python2.7: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
```

but the python folder is there:

```
-bash-3.00# ls /opt/csw/lib/python2.7
site-packages
```

What is the problem here?
