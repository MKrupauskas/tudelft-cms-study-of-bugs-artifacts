### Description of Issue/Question

With 2018.3 release, there is regression in file.managed states WRT  [found unexpected ':'](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/YAMLColonInFlowContext) issue.  
Sorry I have no logs available.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

These values have embedded Colon" and file.managed context parsing fails.
```
etcd:
  service:
    initial_cluster: etcd0=https://127.0.0.1:2380
    initial_cluster_state: new
    initial_cluster_token: etcd-cluster-1
    initial_advertise_peer_urls: https://127.0.0.1:2380
    listen_peer_urls: https://127.0.0.1:2380
    listen_client_urls: https://127.0.0.1:2379
    advertise_client_urls: https://127.0.0.1:2379


..

  file.managed:
    - template: jinja
    - context:
      etcd: {{ etcd }}
```

**Workaround:**

```
    - context:
      etcd: {{ etcd|json }}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

A colleague verbally reported same issue with **different formula** so looks like regression.

Reverting to 2017.7 stable resolved any problems.

### Versions Report
