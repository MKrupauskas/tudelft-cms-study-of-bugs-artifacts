Currently when Salt is used to configure bonding on a Debian based system the `/etc/network/interfaces` file is generated with `bond_*` style options.  However, this is a more obscure form than the typically seen `bond-*` style options found in most documentation.  For example, the official [Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt) only references `bond-*` style options, and makes no reference to underscore style `bond_*` options.  This is also the case for the official [Ubuntu Bonding](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBonding) documentation. The official [Debian Bonding Guide](https://wiki.debian.org/Bonding) shows both dash and underscore styles.

Also, using dashes instead of underscores is more consistent with most other options typically seen in `/etc/network/interfaces` files. The options in Salt's `debian_eth.jinja` file that use dashes:

```
allow-hotplug
vlan-raw-device
dns-nameservers
dns-search
wireless-essid
wireless-mode
wpa-ap-scan
wpa-conf
wpa-driver
wpa-group
wpa-key-mgmt
wpa-pairwise
wpa-proto
wpa-psk
wpa-roam
wpa-ssid
pre-up
post-up
pre-down
post-down
```

Compare this with the only other options that seem to typically be used with underscores are the various `bridge_*` options.

It would be more consistent with most online bonding documentation, as well as the rest of the other Salt Debian based network options, if dashes were used instead of underscores in the bonding options.
