I've been trying to test the solarisips package provider which works after a few little tweeks (including changing the virtualname and autodetection parameters).  Solaris 11 requires the use of both IPS and SRV5 style packages which I planned to use the providers over-ride mechanism to switch as required.

The plan was to fix the autodetection such that IPS is the preferred package manager going forward with fall-back to SRV5 for selected packages.  This no longer works in the latest branches after changing to the LazyLoader scheme which appears to load every module when a provider is specified in a state or config file.

I have created a couple of gists to demonstrate the previous and new behaviours setting a provider over-ride for the brew package as an example.   Please refer to the following examples:
- Behaviour (expected) of salt as provided in the PyPi repository (2014.7.3):
  https://gist.github.com/ag-wood/613c48504aeeec3ea790#file-salt-loader-raw_mod-2014-7-3
- Behaviour of salt in latest branches from GIT (2017.2 and Development):
  https://gist.github.com/ag-wood/613c48504aeeec3ea790#file-salt-loader-raw_mod-2015-2

I will continue to look into the root cause of this but would love some pointers on how I might approach this.
