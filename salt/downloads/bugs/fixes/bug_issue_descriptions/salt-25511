Putting the word `provider` in a cloud provider config file on a deprecation path in favor of `driver` works very well in 2015.8 versions and onward.

But if someone takes a cloud driver from 2015.8 or develop and uses it with a pre-2015.8.0 installation of salt, the driver won't work when using the `create` functions, or anywhere were we're aliasing the driver/provider key like this:

```
if 'provider' in vm_:
    vm_['driver'] = vm_.pop('provider')
```
