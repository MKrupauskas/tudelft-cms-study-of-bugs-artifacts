The file.recurse state fails on a masterless windows minion due to how it treats path separators. File.managed works fine with `/` style source paths, but file.recurse fails to find the source unless it's written in the form `salt://x\y\z`.

Error:

As stated previously, if I change the state file to use the source in the form `salt://base\heka\lua_decoders` it works correctly, but this form would break on other platforms and/or using it with a master, plus it looks super weird in the "url" style format.
