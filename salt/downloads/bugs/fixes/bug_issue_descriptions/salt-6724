I was trying to refine and test the https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/salt-formula repo and keep running into this issue.

In my setup I have a Debian 7 box setup as my test master, with just the salt-formula repo via gitfs_remotes for state file definitions.

In this test I have the following servers launched via salt-cloud:
centos-kw-test: CentOS 6.3
debian-kw-test: Debian 7 (Wheezy)
fedora-kw-test: Fedora 18 (Spherical Cow)
ubuntu-kw-test: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
gentoo-kw-test: Gentoo 13.3

When I tried to run `salt \*test state.sls salt.master` the processes seem to have all completed correctly, but only the ubuntu and fedora boxes returned, the other left defunct children as seen at https://gist.github.com/KennethWilke/6242422

I was able to fix this by killing the parent salt-minion processes and restarting them, re-running the state command returned sucessfully the second time. After this I tested `salt \*test service.restart salt-master` and the issue recurred, only the fedora and ubuntu boxes returned successfully and the centos, debian and gentoo boxes have the defunct pids under salt-minion procs.
