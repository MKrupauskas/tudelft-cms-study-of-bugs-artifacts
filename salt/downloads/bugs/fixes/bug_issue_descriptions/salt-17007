When reproducing the setup from https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/7630#issue-20557910 with a masterless minion, some odd behavior is observed:

```
[root@cent6 base]# salt-call state.single file.managed /tmp/foo.txt contents_pillar=foo
[CRITICAL] Rendering SLS 'test' failed, render error:
Jinja variable 'dict' object has no attribute 'mycustomgrain'
[CRITICAL] Pillar render error: Rendering SLS 'test' failed. Please see master log for details.

```

The render error is found, but the file.managed state proceeds anyway, resulting in the target file being empty.

After syncing grains, the problem goes away.
