When test mode is set by default (in minion config `test: True`), at least `salt-call --local` command does not respect override given in command line.
### Actual Results

```
> grep 'test:' /etc/salt/minion
test: True

> salt-call --local state.highstate test=False
...
Summary
-------------
Succeeded: 31
Failed:     0
Not Run:    3
-------------
Total:     34
```

Some states were not run.
### Expected Result

The state should be executed as if config file doesn't have `test: True` setting:

```
> grep 'test:' /etc/salt/minion
# no output

> salt-call --local state.highstate test=False
....
Summary
-------------
Succeeded: 34
Failed:     0

Total:     34
```

All states were run.
### Note

This issue correlates with: #7788, #5411, #3363.

The combination where config `test: False` and CLI `test=True` is fine: CLI overrides config and runs all states in test mode as expected.

```
> grep 'test:' /etc/salt/minion
test: False

> salt-call --local state.highstate test=True
...
