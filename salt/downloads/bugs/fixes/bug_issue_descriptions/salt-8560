Custom compiled deb using tag of 0.17.2 (upgraded master, and 1 minion)

```
root@saltmaster01:~# salt 'minion' state.highstate test=True
Failed to authenticate, is this user permitted to execute commands?
```

So I can't run ANY salt commands at this point?

Before upgrading master (still was on 0.17.1), and minion @ 0.17.2 I get massive failures concerning repos:

```
    State: - pkgrepo
    Name:      deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian newrelic non-free
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False

```

After downgrading master to 0.17.1 I still can't get salt commands to run:

```
root@saltmaster01:~# salt 'minion' state.highstate test=True
Failed to authenticate, is this user permitted to execute commands?
```
