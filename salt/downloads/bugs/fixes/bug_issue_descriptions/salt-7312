I'm trying to empty a directory except for a single file placed there by salt. Using this:

etc/rsyslog.d/:
  file.directory:
    - clean: True
    - exclude_pat: 'E@.*10'

It's my understanding this should leave all files that contain "10", but when I run it it removes all files. I added some debugging to _check_include_exclude and it appears the path_str variable has its first character truncated, which causes the match to fail (ie, a file named 10-whatever is passed in as 0-whatever).

I'm not entirely sure I've debugged the problem correctly, but changing my regular expression or pattern to not include the first character I'm trying to match has resolved the issue.

I'm using version 0.16.4.
