In 2014.7.5 orchestrate displayed a summary for each child job as well as the main orchestrate job. Output was almost identical in style to other salt modules. It no longer seems to in 2015.5.3.

```
Results in 2014.7.5:
Summary
-------------
Succeeded: 11 (changed=10)
Failed:     0
-------------
Total states run:     11
```

Summary still appears if you do `salt * state.highstate`, but a highstate directly but will not appear inside the results from orchestrate. This may partially be due to how orchestrate was changed to show a new style of id and reporting results out of order (using `__run_num__` to figure out their real order).
