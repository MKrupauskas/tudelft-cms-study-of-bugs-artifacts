### Description of Issue
I am working on Manjaro - Arch based Linux distribution.

I wanted to use salt-lint, which unfortunately, asks for salt being installed through python packaging (pip3)

The problem is that the salt package depends on pycrypto, which is at version 2.6.1, which is said, on its home page to have been tested up to python 3.3, and on github, there is no commit since 2014 (!!)

And of course, Arch is using now python 3.8, so I get, from Crypto code:
```
AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'
```

Checking what the distro is using instead of pycrypto - it seems to be pycryptodome, which is a fork/replacement of pycrypto.

You should update the dependency on the python pip package.

### Setup
none

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
have salt-minion try to connect to a master, on a python 3.8 setup, and installed from the python pip package.

By the way, it looks to wrongly detect pycrypto as being installed and NOT pycryptodome! (look also at the versions)
