When using postgres_group.present and postgres_user.present to manage postgresql roles, a highstate with test=True always tells they will be updated, even when already correct. A following highstate with test=False has the correct behavior, and doesn't update the role.
## Example state content :

```
postgresql-group-ldap:
    postgres_group.present:
        - name: ldap
```

---
## Result of a state.highstate with test=True :

```
      ID: postgresql-group-ldap
Function: postgres_group.present
    Name: ldap
  Result: None
 Comment: Group ldap is set to be updated
 Changes:   
```

---
## Result of a state.highstate with test=False :

```
      ID: postgresql-group-ldap
Function: postgres_group.present
    Name: ldap
  Result: True
 Comment: Group ldap is already present
 Changes:   
```

Tested with salt 2014.1.4, and postgresql 8.4/9.1
