I am using the new version in the salt repo for RHEL7 and I am seeing some weird behavior.  When using a configuration with "str" for a hot-hot setup, if both of my masters are up when the minion is started it will connect to both of them no problem and they respond to test.ping commands.  When I shutdown one of the masters, the minion will still respond to test.ping commands.  However, if one of my masters is down in the list on minion start up the minion will fail to completely come up.  Is anyone aware of this issue?

The second problem I am running into, if I setup my minion for "failover" if the first master in my list is down the minion will not attempt to connect to the next one (even with the master_alive_interval set to 10s).  It will continue trying to connect to the downed master over and over again.  If I bring the downed master up, it will connect with an issue, but then if I shut the master down it never actually fails over to the second one in the list.

Does failover work correctly with salt 2014.8.1-1?
