I have run into an issue when trying to execute an orchestrate state on a Syndic from the MoM. The command I am issuing is:

`# salt 'or-syndic-node-test2' saltutil.runner state.orch mods=orch_new_instance`

The log error in the syndic minion log is:

```
[salt.pillar      ][CRITICAL][18742] Rendering SLS 'default' failed, render error:
'config_dir'
```

I traced this down to the GPG renderer:
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/renderers/gpg.py

In particular this function:

```
def _get_key_dir():
    '''
    return the location of the GPG key directory
    '''
    if 'config.get' in __salt__:
        gpg_keydir = __salt__['config.get']('gpg_keydir')
    else:
        gpg_keydir = __opts__.get('gpg_keydir')
    return gpg_keydir or os.path.join(__opts__['config_dir'], 'gpgkeys')
```

I have verified that the __opts__ dict does not include the gpg_keydir. I modified the config.get call to add a default directory and this resolves the issue.
        `gpg_keydir = __salt__['config.get']('gpg_keydir', '/etc/salt/gpgkeys')`

This is just a temporary solution for me and i was hoping there was a better solution. The same orchestrate state works perfectly when called directly on the syndic using salt-run. I have been unable to tell for sure why the dict is missing the gpg_keydir, and possibly other entries, however I have a guess. From what I can tell the minion does not have gpg_keydir set. Since the minion is actually executing the orch runner via saltutil, is it possible that the __opts__ dict from the minion is being used, which doesn't contain the gpg_keydir? Can the gpg_keydir be set in the minion? I also do not have the gpg_keydir set explicitly in the Syndic or MoM, the default is being used. 

In addition to this, I discovered the the custom GPG render module with the above fix was also not being used. The module was being sync'd to the nodes, however I had to edit the version in site-packages in order for this fix to work properly.


### Attempted Remediation Steps:
Add gpg_keydir to pillar
Add gpg_keydir to master config
Add gpg_keydir to minion config on syndic
Add gpg_keydir to syndic config

None of the above steps resulted in the gpg_keydir from being present in __opts__ dict.


### Setup

Pillar with GPG data in it:

```
#!yaml|gpg

auth_backend: ldap

mail_relay:
  hostname: MAILRELAY
  aliases:
    - util
  ip: IP.ADD.DRE.SS

global_env:
  cert_bucket: S3-Bucket

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run The following from the MoM:
`salt 'or-salt-syndic' saltutil.runner state.orch mods=orch_new_thingworx_instance 'pillar={cust_name: acme-sbox2, instance_type: dev, ext_dns: acme-sbox2, region: or, environmentId: 2112, rds_pool_num: 1}'`
