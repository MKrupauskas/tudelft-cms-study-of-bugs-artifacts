We were using salt-cloud to provision servers on Linode, and all was good, until our API key expired. :-(

It appears the old Linode API is still available and working (we have some valid API keys on our dev Linode account which appear to be working), but the old manager was decommissioned in January 2020, so you can't make new API keys for the old API:

I looked at the code in the master branch for the Linode driver and it looks like it's all specific to the old API (you can tell from the all caps JSON keys):

Going forward, salt-cloud is going to need to interact with the API, because no one is going to be able to get keys for the old API (and probably at some point they'll decommission the old API too). m. Until that point, we're going to be locked out from using salt-cloud!
