Hi there, when running the state:

``` yaml
/home/vagrant/venv:
  virtualenv.managed:
    - system_site_packages: False
    - requirements: salt://python-virtualenv/requirements.txt
    - user: vagrant
```

I get the following deprecation warning from modules.pip: 

```
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/pip.py:252: DeprecationWarning: The 'runas' argument to pip.install is deprecated, and will be removed in 0.18.0. Please use 'user' instead.
[DEBUG   ] Changing ownership of requirements file '/tmp/tmpznJT2R' to user 'vagrant'
[INFO    ] Executing command "/home/vagrant/venv/bin/pip install --requirement='/tmp/tmpznJT2R'" as user 'vagrant' in directory '/home/vagrant'
```

Since I'm new to salt, I can't seem to find the code in virtualenv.py that calls this.

PS: Used `- runas: vagrant` at first, then when seeing the deprecation warning, I used `user`. But the `user` param is not really accepted by `virtualenv_mod.py`, but the command seems to work fine anyway, with the same warning of course.
