After upgrading from debian jessie-backports `2015.5.3+ds-1~bpo+1` to repo.saltstack.com `2015.5.9+ds-2` (after #30696 got solved), I cannot apply highstate anymore.

I am getting error messages like:

```
salt 'hvm01*' pillar.items
hvm01.example.com:
    ----------
    _errors:
        - Specified SLS 'salt.mine.hostsfile' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
        - Specified SLS 'proxy' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
        - Specified SLS 'postfix.relay' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
        - Specified SLS 'nginx' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
    nginx:
      ng:
[...]
```

This suggests that the pillar data cannot be retrieved.
However the data that is expected to be in the pillar is listed properly and using pillar.get shows the same output without the error message which is a bit confusing.

```

I am using gitpython as the git ext_pillar provider, tried upgrading it but didn't make a change.
Downgrading to the version from debian backports makes everything back to normal.

Issues that look similar but not the same version are: #30545, #31220 and #31385.
