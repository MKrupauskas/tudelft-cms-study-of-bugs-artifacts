given a sls file like:

```
test1:
  file.append:
    - name: /tmp/test.txt
    - text: "foo bar"
test2:
  file.append:
    - name: /tmp/test.txt
    - text: "foo    bar"
```

you would expect to see results of:

```
foo bar
foo bar
```

but instead you get 

```
foo bar
```

as salt does not appear to differentiate between spaces and tabs for file.append.  This is not documented on https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.append , and appears to be unintentional.

This was tested on 2015.8.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.
