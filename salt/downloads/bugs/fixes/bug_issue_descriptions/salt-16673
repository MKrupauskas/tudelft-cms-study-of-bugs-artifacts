I have disk monitoring built around parsing the output of 

```
salt \* status.diskusage / --out json --out-indent -1
```

With 2014.1.10, that gave me one JSON object per line, which was simple to parse. 2014.1.11 breaks that, giving me output more like:

```
...
{
"octopus": {
"/": {
"available": 17759469568, 
"total": 21001531392
}
}
}
{
"torch": {
"/": {
"available": 17618681856, 
"total": 21001531392
}
}
}
{
"gustav": {
"/": {
"available": 16899362816, 
"total": 21001531392
}
}
}
```

Which is decidedly less useful.

I believe 6c8d7d5456924a6ee5c3bd436538e0062078f5c6 introduced this change. In the comment in that code, it appears that the way to get one object per line is now to set `output_indent` to Null. I'm not sure exactly where that's supposed to happen, but I'm assuming in a master or minion config (there doesn't seem to be a way to set that with commandline options).

So first, it's not clear to me how to restore the old behavior at all. Second, I'm not sure I would want that configured at master/minion level.
