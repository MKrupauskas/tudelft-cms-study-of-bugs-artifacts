### Description of Issue/Question

When running `salt-ssh` I expect it to respect the master option `pillar_merge_lists` but it does not. Unless it is set as an explicit minion option in the roster (`minion_opts:`) it will always default to false. This may be a regression but the changes from #32665 (issue #30809) are still in place. 

My debugging led me to the minion-generated [opts_pkg dict](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2016.11.2/salt/client/ssh/__init__.py#L880) which is passed as “opts” throughout the code. The `__master_opts__` key (added to the dict by the master a few lines further down) contains the master options but all the code only ever cares about the first level dict, never bothering to check the nested master opts. Since this is not the only option that may affect what pillar data a minion will see I’m uncertain if this is intended, a regression, and/or a bug and how best to resolve it. I would rather not specify this as a `minion_opt` for every minion.


### Setup

I used Vagrant with the libvirt provider to set up a test environment for anyone to reproduce. Play around with the `pillar_merge_lists` options in the `minion_opts` and master configuration file.

Create `Vagrantfile`
```sh
cd $(mktemp -d) && cat >Vagrantfile <<EOF
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "debian/jessie64"
  config.vm.provision :salt do |salt|
    # This sets the official Salt repositories up for us
    salt.install_master = true
    salt.no_minion = true
  end
end
EOF
```

Commands
```sh
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
# Now continue in the vagrant box
ssh-add -L >>.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo -i
apt update && apt install salt-ssh
# Add the files below
# Then continue:
salt-ssh -i 'castle' test.ping
salt-ssh -i 'castle' pillar.items
```

Files inside the Vagrant box:
```
==> /etc/salt/roster <==
castle:
  host: localhost
  user: vagrant
  sudo: True
#  minion_opts:
#    pillar_merge_lists: True

==> /etc/salt/master.d/vagrant.conf <==
ssh_use_home_key: True
pillar_merge_lists: True

==> /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant-ssh <==
Defaults    env_keep+=SSH_AUTH_SOCK

==> /srv/pillar/dragons.sls <==
kill:
  - knights

==> /srv/pillar/knights.sls <==
kill:
  - dragons

==> /srv/pillar/top.sls <==
base:
  '*':
    - dragons
    - knights
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Fire up the above Vagrant environment and play around with the option.

```sh
# enable the option only in the master conf
root@jessie:~% vim /etc/salt/master.d/vagrant.conf
root@jessie:~% salt-ssh --refresh 'castle' pillar.items
castle:
    ----------
    kill:
        - dragons
# Now enable it in minion_opts
root@jessie:~% vim /etc/salt/roster
root@jessie:~% salt-ssh --refresh 'castle' pillar.items
castle:
    ----------
    kill:
        - knights
        - dragons
```
