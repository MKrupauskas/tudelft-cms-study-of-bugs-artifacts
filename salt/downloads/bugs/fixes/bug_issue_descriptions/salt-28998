FWIW, i do not like at all the proposed patches, the uses_systemd thing is ugly and add too much code.

If the detection of systemd in there fails, this is this code that has to be fixed, and not a workaround if branch.

The patches for new options for salt cloud templates are wrong, the thing to patch is the module execution interface method.
