### Description of Issue/Question
I accidentally reused an IP address that exists on the network when creating an aliased interface (eg. eth0:1). Salt reports the interface as being successfully added. Should this not rather fail?
### Setup
{{ eth0:1 }}:
  network.managed:
    - name: eth0:1
    - enabled: True
    - type: eth
    - ipaddr: 172.16.0.1
    - netmask: 255.255.0.0

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
   ID: eth0:1
   Function: network.managed
   Name: eth0:1
   Result: True
   Comment: Interface eth0:0 added.
   Started: 12:03:31.274729
   Duration: 4511.09 ms

   Changes:
   interface:
         Added network interface.
   status:
          Interface eth0:0 is up

The created interface does not appear in the output of ifconfig but the ifcfg-eth0:1 file is created in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.
