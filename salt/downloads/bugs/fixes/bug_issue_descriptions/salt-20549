line 156 in salt/states/mount.py should be changed from

```
           if real_device not in device_list:
```

to

```
           if real_device not in [n.rstrip('/') for n in device_list]:
```

This would strip all trailing '/'  from all devices in device_list before comparing it with real_device, which has its trailing slash stripped.

Reason:

NFS mounts, which are already existing, are not matched with the specified name, this gives the following output:

```
          ID: /old_data
    Function: mount.mounted
      Result: True
     Comment: Target was successfully mounted. Entry already exists in the fstab.

              mount:
                  True
              umount:
                  Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: 192.168.0.207:/data1, current: 192.168.0.207:/data1/, /192.168.0.207:/data1
```

Note the trailing slash  of the first and leading slash of the second device name after `current:`
Both do not match the real device. 

netmount.sls file:

```
/old_data:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: 192.168.0.207:/data1
    - fstype: nfs4
