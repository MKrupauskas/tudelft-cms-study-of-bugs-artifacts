### Issue Explained
Have setup external_auth for pam as below, but when I try to run some check on a node group configured 
External_auth setting in the master file
```
external_auth:
  pam:
    dl salt admin%:
      - .*
      - '@wheel'
      - '@runner'
      - '@jobs'
```
Node Group setting in the master file
```
nodegroups:
  DEW1: 'vml*.odf.utx.corp'
#DEW1 - ~1400 servers    
```
Error while running on a node group, but if works as a root user am able to poll the node group
```
[07:05 AM] i@salt03: salt -a pam -N patch_grp1 test.ping
username: i
