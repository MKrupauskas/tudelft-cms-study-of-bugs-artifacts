### Description of Issue/Question
After upgrading salt-master and salt-minion to 2017.7.0 file.managed runs approx 4 times slower than with the old 2016.11.0 version.

state duration before upgrade:
```
Name: /etc/vim/vimrc - Function: file.managed - Result: Clean Started: - 09:30:49.446082 Duration: 44.77 ms
```
state duration after upgrade:
```
Name: /etc/vim/vimrc - Function: file.managed - Result: Clean Started: - 14:16:04.989995 Duration: 164.882 ms
```
managing hundreds of servers with each of them having multiple file.managed states just got worse. the current performance in a huge environment is not acceptable.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- run file.managed state before and after salt-minion and salt-master upgrade and compare timings
