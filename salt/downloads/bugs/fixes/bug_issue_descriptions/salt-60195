**Description**
Trying to debug a jinja template via show_full_context() or straight from the documentation:
Context is: {{ show_full_context()|yaml(False) }}

Should return a dictionary with the a lot of values ....

Example.sls

```
#!jinja|yaml
{% set node = 'unbound' %}
always-passes:
  test.succeed_without_changes:
    - name: {{node}}

Context is: {{ show_full_context()|yaml(False) }}
```
Returns:
```
root@raspberrypi:~# salt 'freebsd_vm' state.apply 'jail.test'
