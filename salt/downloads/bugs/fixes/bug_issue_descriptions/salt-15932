If a user already exists on the system it should also compare groups the user is in to check for any differences in the group list.

E.g., `larry` doesn't show up in the `bar` group.

``` yaml
ommon_users:
  user.present:
    - names:
      - larry
      - curly
      - moe
    - groups:
      - foo

dev_users:
  user.present:
    - name: larry
    - groups:
      - bar
```
