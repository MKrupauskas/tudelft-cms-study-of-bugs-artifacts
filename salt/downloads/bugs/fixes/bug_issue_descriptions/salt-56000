### Description of Issue

Authentication error occurred when using salt-cli on multi-master if masters share cache dir. 

I have 2 salt-masters which are multi-master (active-active). Recently i updated my salt-master's version from `2017.7.8` to `2019.2.0`.
Everything worked fine, but the salt command run from the command line causes an authentication error on the master that was started first.

Then I found this [commit](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/dc910550596e6bf90c09d565eea27e013bbcc8cf). This commit change the directory where authentication key for local communication located. `key_dir` -> `cache_dir`. The authentication key is generated when salt restarted and is used to authenticate when the local user publishes the job.

Because my salt-masters share cache dir(using nfs) to share the gitfs filesystem backend, so the location of authentication key will be same and shared between masters.
since the late started master deletes the existing key`/var/cache/salt/master/.root_key`, the first started master loses the key, causing an authentication error.

is there any workaround to avoid authentication error in this situation?
can i seperate cache dir and key dir as in `2017.7.8`? 
or is it possible the master load an existing key rather than generate one each time it is restarted(this maybe not good for security)?
or sharing cache dir is not recommended usage for multi master?


### Setup
1. install and run multi master
   - share cache dir with nfs
2. connect minions to multi master


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. run command on shell `sudo salt 'minion1' test.ping`
2. `Authentication error occurred.` is occured only the master started first, the late started master works fine
