### Description of Issue/Question
when a grain module returns a tuple as opposed to a list it can't be targeted by value as expected

for example `osrelease_info` returns a tuple and as a result cannot be targeted based on a value eg `osrelease_info:6`

what is confusing is that a master will match a minion ok however the minion itself will not match, so running `salt -G "osrelease_info:6" grains.get saltversion` will yield `Minion did not return. [No response]` from all of the minions that did actually match for `osrelease_info:6`

changing the core.py grain definition for osrelease_info to return a list fixes the issue for me but possibly osrelease_info was made a tuple for performance reasons - #13822

probably finding out why the minion can't access `:0` on the tuple would be the right way to fix

### Setup
nothing special

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt -G "osrelease_info:6" grains.get saltversion
salt-call grains.get osrelease_info:6
