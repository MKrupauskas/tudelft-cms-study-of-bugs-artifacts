### Description of Issue/Question
The status.process salt state always returns false.  Testing with the salt module status.pid works as expected.

### Setup
```
admin@server:~$ cat /srv/salt/process-check.sls
Check if salt is running:
    status.process:
        - name: salt
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

This simple sls script just checks for the process name  "salt", which should match the salt-minion processes on the salt-minion; but the check always comes back false.

```
admin@server:~$ salt '*' state.sls process-check
test-minion:
----------
          ID: Check if ssh is running
    Function: status.process
        Name: salt
      Result: False
     Comment: Process signature "salt" not found
     Started: 01:47:35.468477
    Duration: 111.69 ms
     Changes:

Summary for test-minion
------------
Succeeded: 0
Failed:    1
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time: 111.690 ms
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```


The module that status.process calls is status.pid, which returns the list of pids matching "salt".

```
admin@server:~$ salt '*' status.pid salt
test-minion:
    5272
    5278
    5281
    16892
    18658
```
