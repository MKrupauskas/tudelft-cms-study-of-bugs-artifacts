I just installed a debian stable server with salt-minion 0.16 and updated my master to have 0.16 and there is no debconf module on it, I added the providers with apt in /etc/salt/minion to be able to use apt as backend, but I have no idea what is happening with the debconf module.

It seem that **grains**['os_family'] is returning a string with "" included that is '"Debian"' then the comparison should be (in modules/debconfmod.py function **virtual**):
    if **grains**['os_family'] != '"Debian"':

But I imagine the error is in the way we're getting the os family.
