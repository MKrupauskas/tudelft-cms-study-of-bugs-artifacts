### Description of Issue/Question
It appears that since the upgrade to Salt 2016.11.1 (most likely also 2016.11.0, but we skipped this due to bugs in some modules) the minion doesn't return the highstate results back to the master.

Before Salt 2015.8.0 this wasn't working either. Back then I used my custom returner which used `event.fire_master` to send the return back to the master but since then this wasn't needed anymore. However, due to the chances in the event module this wouldn't work anymore (since it sets up a Salt Client Caller with `file_client=local`)

Old minions running 2016.3.3 and 2016.3.4 still report their highstates. Those that have been upgraded to 2016.11.1 are no longer doing this.

I have now made changes to my own returner to use `use_master_when_local` and highstate results are being returned again, though this is not very optimal since it used to work just fine in the salt-minion in the past without needing workarounds.
