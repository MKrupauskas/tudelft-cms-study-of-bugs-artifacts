@thatch45 FYI, I think this is a show stopper for 2014.1.0

This is causing an exception on 0.16/0.17 minions when the master is upgraded to 2014.1.0

```
[WARNING ] TypeError encountered executing saltutil.find_job: find_job() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given). See debug log for more info. Possibly a missing arguments issue: ArgSpec(args=['jid'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)
```

The kwargs processing code in the 2014.1.0 minion has changed so the issue went unnoticed.

Update - I believe it's just an issue for gather_job_info (so just saltutil.find_job)
