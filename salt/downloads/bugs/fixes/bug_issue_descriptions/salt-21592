Not only does the ini state module rewrite every single line in the file such that `foo = bar` becomes `foo=bar`, even when `foo` is not managed by the module, it also removes lines it doesn't like.

For example, `my.cnf` that comes with MySQL ends with a line like `!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/`. The ini state will delete this line without even reporting the fact.
