### Description

I just installed salt-master-2015.8.7-228.4.x86_64 on my openSUSE Leap 42.1 host and try to start it:
`# salt-master -d`
`'/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/pygit2/__pycache__/pygit2_cffi_ccb73b72x5470904.c:208:18: fatal error: git2.h: No such file or directory`
`#include <git2.h>`
`^`
`compilation terminated.`
`Traceback (most recent call last):`
`File "/usr/bin/salt-master", line 22, in <module>`
`salt_master()`
`File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 47, in salt_master`
`master.start()`
...
`File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/cffi/ffiplatform.py", line 60, in _build`
`raise VerificationError('%s: %s' % (e.__class__.__name__, e))`
`cffi.ffiplatform.VerificationError: CompileError: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`
### Setup

I did not configure anything, as https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/index.html states.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

See above
### Versions Report

(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`.)
This command also terminates with the same missing file. The package salt-master has been installed from repo.saltstack.com, the package python-pygit2 is from the Leap main repo. Which package am I missing to provide the missing file git2.h?

Choosing the slightly older versions from the obs:systemsmanagement:saltstack repo does not change a bit, salt-master terminates with the same message.
