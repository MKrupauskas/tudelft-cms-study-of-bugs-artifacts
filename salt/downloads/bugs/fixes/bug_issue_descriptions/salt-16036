salt/utils/openstack/pyrax/queues.py:43: [E1103(maybe-no-member), RackspaceQueues.delete] Instance of 'dict' has no 'delete' member (but some types could not be inferred)
```

It seems possible that if `show()` encounters an exception, or if the queue is deleted in the time between the existence check and the call to `show()`, then the code will attempt to invoke `.delete()` on an empty dict, and dicts have no `.delete()` method.
