It looks like require_in clause is broken when works with yum.

For example, my states are:

```
#my-repo.sls
my-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: #...
    - name: #...
    - baseurl: #...
    - gpgkey: #...

#my-cool-pkg.sls
include:
  - long.so.long.path.to.my-repo

extend:
  my-repo:
    pkgrepo.managed:
      - require_in:
        - pkg: my-cool-pkg

my-cool-pkg:
  pkg.latest
```

After calling

```
salt 'node' state.sls my-cool-pkg
```

on CentOS 6.4 (0.16.0 salt) i have the repo file contains

```
require_in=[{'pkg': 'my-cool-pkg'}]
```

line
