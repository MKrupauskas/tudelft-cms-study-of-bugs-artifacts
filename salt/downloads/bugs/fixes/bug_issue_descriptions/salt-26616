I get the following error when trying to add a postgres user:

```

    Function: postgres_user.present
        Name: user-name
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

Note that this is on 2014.7.6, but the same code is present currently:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/postgres_user.py#L187

I'm not exactly sure what causes this, as the exact same code snippet was working perfectly fine prior to this with the same code. I'm just adding a postgres user with the name and password set to pillar values, however with the password (and username) set to a static value it still generates the error above.
