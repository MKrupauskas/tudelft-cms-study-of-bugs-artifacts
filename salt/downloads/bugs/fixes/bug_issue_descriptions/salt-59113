**Description**
Managing an htpasswd file with salt's webutil module causes passwords to be logged to `/var/log/salt/minion` in clear text.

**Setup**
```
web_user:
  webutil.user_exists:
    - name: web_user
    - password: {{ password }}
    - htpasswd_file: /var/www/localhost/htpasswd  
    - update: true
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run highstate against machine which doesn't already have the htpasswd file created.  Errors are reported but state is applied correctly.  The error is in the change validation from what I can tell.

```
2020-12-09 23:30:54,176 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod:841 ][ERROR   ][5444] Command '['htpasswd', '-bv', '/var/www/localhost/htpasswd', 'web_user', '<removed for security>']' failed with return code: 3
2020-12-09 23:30:54,177 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod:845 ][ERROR   ][5444] stderr: password verification failed
2020-12-09 23:30:54,177 [salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod:847 ][ERROR   ][5444] retcode: 3
```

**Expected behavior**
The state to be applied and the password verification not to report an error or if there is an exeception, mask sensitive data being reported in the error.
