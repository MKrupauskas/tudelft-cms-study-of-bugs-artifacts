### Description of Issue/Question
From the default config:
```
# Enable permissive access to the salt keys. This allows you to run the
# master or minion as root, but have a non-root group be given access to
# your pki_dir. To make the access explicit, root must belong to the group
# you've given access to. This is potentially quite insecure. If an autosign_file
# is specified, enabling permissive_pki_access will allow group access to that
# specific file.
# permissive_pki_access: False
```
If you look at the code in `salt/utils/verify.py` you'll see this option actually impacts the mode/permissions of ANY directory passed into the `verify_env`  and in fact has no specific impact on the `pki` directory whatsoever. It may make sense to change the name/description of this option to better match what it actually does.
