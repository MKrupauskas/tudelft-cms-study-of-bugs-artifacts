### Description of Issue/Question
The trafficserver state and module always fail with:
`Passed invalid arguments: can only concatenate list (not "tuple") to list.`

This seems to boil down to: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/80d90307b07b3703428ecbb7c8bb468e28a9ae6d/salt/modules/trafficserver.py#L35-L36
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/80d90307b07b3703428ecbb7c8bb468e28a9ae6d/salt/modules/trafficserver.py#L39-L40

As a quick hack, converting the tuple to a list and stringifying seems to work around the issue (beware of potential for problems with shell escaping):
`return ' '.join([_TRAFFICCTL] + [str(arg) for arg in args])`
`return ' '.join([_TRAFFICLINE] + [str(arg) for arg in args])`

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
`apt install trafficserver`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt-call --local trafficserver.status`
