### Description of Issue/Question
Every state in state module ini_manage (except for section_absent) throws an Exception during dry run when option without a section is provided no matter what is already in ini file.


### Setup
```yaml
ini-present:
    ini.options_present:
        - name: /tmp/test.ini
        - strict: True
        - sections:
            selfopt1: val1
            sect1:
                sopt1: val11

ini-absent:
    ini.options_absent:
        - name: /tmp/test.ini
        - sections:
            selfopt1: val1
            sect1:
                sopt1: val11

ini-sect-present:
    ini.sections_present:
        - name: /tmp/test.ini
        - sections:
            - sect1
            - sect2
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Command:
`saltcall --local state.sls dev.ini test=True`

Result:
