Something I noticed on my recent new Ubuntu installs (14.04 and 14.10): `/etc/ufw/salt.ufw` is missing. It always worked before and I could run `ufw allow salt` out of the box, but not anymore.

I think [this file](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/43e69d2842c34cfb49b8997c7c3d5b378b43406a/debian/salt-common.install) should handle it (or at least provide the paths to copy), but I don't know how the installation process works. Is this a regression?
