 I am trying to version lock a certain version of nginx. The Fedora 22 nginx package has an epoch of "1". Unless the version is set as "1:1.8.0-10.fc22", it won't find it. But after it is installed, it recognizes the version as "1.8.0-10.fc22", and so still breaks.

``` saltstack
State:
nginx-pkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - nginx: {{ pillar['nginx'][grains['release_tag']]['version'] }}
```

``` saltstack
Pillar:
nginx:
   fc22:
     version: 1:1.8.0-10.fc22
```
