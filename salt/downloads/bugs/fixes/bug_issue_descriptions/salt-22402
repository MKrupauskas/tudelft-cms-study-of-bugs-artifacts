with openssl you may create a self signed cert like this:

```
openssl genrsa -out fd-$HOSTNAME.key 2048
openssl req -new -key fd-$HOSTNAME.key -x509 -out fd-$HOSTNAME.cert -days 7300
```

Depending on default openssl.cnf for example from openssl ubuntu package, `[usr_cert]` includes `subjectKeyIdentifier=hash`.

But `tls.create_self_signed_cert` misses this, which will let fail, in my case, the certificate creation from salt master (with external pillar, best practice see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/salt-users/D1WRJPaE284/Zjz-rXnucG8J)) for encrypted bacula backups, because bacula file daemon needs `subjectKeyIdentifier` within the self signed cert.

`subjectKeyIdentifier` is set only within the salt module for ca cert based certificate creation
