### Description of Issue

file.managed renders jinja and calculates the diffs between existing file and source file twice.  This is suboptimal and file.check_managed_changes should only run when `test=True`
### Setup

Was running a file.managed with a jinja template and noticed that jinja templating was being called twice for every file.managed.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Make a file.managed with a jinja template and have the jinja code log something and notice it is called twice.
### Versions Report

Noticed bug appeared when upgrading from 2015.8 to 2016.3.  Verified bug exists in todays develop branch.  I have a fix for develop and 2016.3.  Will make a PR shortly.
