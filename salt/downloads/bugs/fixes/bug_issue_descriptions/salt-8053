Need to detect duplicate keys and alert accordingly. Currently this issue persists in 0.16.4 and 0.17.1 versions.

A simple example.
---- mystate.sls---
/tmp/test-file1:
  file.touch

/tmp/test-file1:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://another-file2
------mystate,sls----

I can run 
   salt '*' state.sls mystate
and it will execute one of the state from above.
