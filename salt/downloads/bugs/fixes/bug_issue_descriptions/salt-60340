**Description**
The option to specify the port was removed from the Junos proxy minion. This is what enables running Netconf connections over SSH. As far as I can tell, just adding this option back to the list of parameters in `def init` function resolves the issue and allows Netconf connections over SSH again.

**Setup**
Run `git diff v3002.6 v3003 salt/proxy/junos.py` to see that the port option was removed from the `def init` function.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant)

**Expected behavior**
Respect the port specification in the Pillar configuration.
