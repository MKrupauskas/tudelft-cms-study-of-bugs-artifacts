Testing a bunch of commands on windows 2008 servers (0.16.0 minions, 0.16.0 master). Running 8 or so Windows minions and 2 centos. Everything was working great until i ran a glob "salt '_win_' cmd.run 'powershell.exe '" (yes, not something you should really ever run...powershell with no cmdlets/params) and then after a bit I had to CTRL + C

Exiting on Ctrl-C
This job's jid is:
20130717223346282287
The minions may not have all finished running and any remaining minions will return upon completion. To look up the return data for this job later run:
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20130717223346282287

After that the minions would not respond, even to test.ping, until the minion service was manually restarted. 

I was able to recreate this issue after all the minions were restarted. 

[root@saltpoc201 salt]#  salt '_win_' cmd.run test.ping
[root@saltpoc201 salt]#

Restarting individual minion services brought them back to life, even when others were still unresponsive.
