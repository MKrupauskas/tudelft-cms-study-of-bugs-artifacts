I tried deploying ssh key to a remote machine using salt-ssh but failed. 

The command I used is

> salt-ssh 'machine1' --key-deploy 

and I got the following error:

> machine1:
>           /usr/bin/python2.6: can't open file '/tmp/.salt/salt-call': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

Since I couldn't find much usage of the option --key-deploy from the docs,
I'm just wondering if I used the option incorrectly or it is a bug. Thanks.

My salt-ssh version:
