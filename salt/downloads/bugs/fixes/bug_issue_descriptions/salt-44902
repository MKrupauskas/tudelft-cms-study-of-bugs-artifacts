### Description of Issue/Question

openSUSE allows to install multiple versions of the kernel, which means I have two `kernel-default` packages (same name, but different version) installed at the same time. There are also multiple `gpg-pubkey` package:

```
# rpm -q kernel-default gpg-pubkey
kernel-default-4.4.90-18.32.1.x86_64
kernel-default-4.4.92-18.36.1.x86_64
gpg-pubkey-307e3d54-4be01a65
gpg-pubkey-3dbdc284-53674dd4
gpg-pubkey-6912ee37-58b4c885
```

If a package gets updated via `pkg.latest`, the diff view also reports differences for `kernel-default` and `gpg-pubkey` (the "real" diff is that `jenkins` got updated):

```

                  ----------
                  new:
                      4.4.92-31.1
                  old:
                      4.4.90-28.1,4.4.92-31.1
```

It seems the code that provides the `new` values only reports one version, while the code that provides the `old` values reports all installed versions.

### Setup
```
jenkins:
  service.running:
    - enable: True
  pkg.latest:
    - fromrepo: devel:tools:building
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: devel:tools:building
    - humanname: devel:tools:building
    - baseurl: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/tools:/building/openSUSE_Leap_{{ salt['grains.get']('osrelease') }}/
    - gpgautoimport: True
    - priority: 155
    - refresh: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
* make sure you have an old versions of jenkins installed (you can probably use any other package to test this, as long as it's outdated and an update is available)
* make sure you have multiple packages with the same name installed (`rpm -q gpg-pubkey kernel-default should give more than one result for one of these packages)
* run `state.highstate`

This is from the master. It's running openSUSE 42.2 (as reported), but I use the (rebuilt-for-42.2 ) salt package from openSUSE 42.3.

The minion is openSUSE 42.3 with salt-2017.7.2-14.1.x86_64
