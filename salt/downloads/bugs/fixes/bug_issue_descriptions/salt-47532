### Description of Issue/Question
I don't want this feature, and if it should stay it should be disabled by default.

```salt/client/ssh/__init__.py```:
```
                    roster_fp.write('# Automatically added by "{s_user}" at {s_time}\n{hostname}:\n    host: '
                                    '{hostname}\n    user: {user}'
                                    '\n    passwd: {passwd}\n'.format(s_user=getpass.getuser(),
                                                                      s_time=datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
                                                                      hostname=self.opts.get('tgt', ''),
                                                                      user=self.opts.get('ssh_user', ''),
                                                                      passwd=self.opts.get('ssh_passwd', '')))
                log.info('The host {0} has been added to the roster {1}'.format(self.opts.get('tgt', ''),
                                                                                roster_file))
        else:
log.error('Unable to update roster {0}: access denied'.format(roster_file))
```

It causes things like in my roster:
```
# Automatically added by "edgan" at 2018-05-07T22:18:44.047773
None:
    host: None
    user: ubuntu
    passwd: 
```

Even if the None worked right, which is another bug, I don't want it editing my roster file.

### Setup
roster:
```
dns-dns-01.inf.us-west-2.aws.acme.com:
  host: 10.200.32.10
  sudo: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```salt-ssh -i dns-dns-02.inf.us-west-2.aws.acme.com state.highstate```
