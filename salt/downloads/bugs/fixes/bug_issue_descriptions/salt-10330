I'll happily get schooled if I'm not using it correctly, but trying to "exclude" an SLS doesn't seem to work. Here is a contrived example to illustrate what I'm seeing.

**top.sls**

```
base:
  '*':
    - basic
```

**basic.sls**

```
include:
  - vim

exclude:
  - sls: vim

vim-enhanced:
  pkg.installed
```

**vim.sls**

```
vim-enhanced:
  pkg.installed
```

My understanding from the docs is that excluding vim.sls should entirely remove its contents from the highstate data before trying to evaluate it. But instead, I get the following error running a state.highstate:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
    The conflicting ID is "vim-enhanced" and is found in SLS "base:basic" and SLS "base:vim"
```
