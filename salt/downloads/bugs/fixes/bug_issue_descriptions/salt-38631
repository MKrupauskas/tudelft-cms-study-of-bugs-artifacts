### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup

https://gist.github.com/doitian/edc9fa7e0e0dcca21f722a3d2e024296

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt-call -c ./ state.orchestrate orch_test
```

In masterless mode, `state.sls` is called directly, but kwargs is nested in `kwarg` so all arguments are not passed to the underlying function.
