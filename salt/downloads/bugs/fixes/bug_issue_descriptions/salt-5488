@UtahDave This might be something for you to look into. I don't think that the _is_bin function is used anywhere in win_file.py so this might be able to be removed.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/erik/salt/salt/loader.py", line 600, in gen_functions
    ), fn_, path, desc
  File "/home/erik/salt/salt/modules/win_file.py", line 28, in <module>
    from salt.modules.file import (check_hash, check_managed, check_perms, # pylint: disable=W0611
ImportError: cannot import name _is_bin
```
