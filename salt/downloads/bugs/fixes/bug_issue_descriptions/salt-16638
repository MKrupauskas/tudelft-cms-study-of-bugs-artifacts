I'm hoping to use s3fs on a new 2014.7 based master.  I was puzzled to find that sls files load fine, but the file.recurse states error out with 'none of the specified sources were found'.  I debugged enough to figure out that `cp.list_master` returns a file list, while `cp.list_master_dirs` is always empty.  There is code in s3fs to list directories, so it looks like it should be working.

The states are in a non-base environment, and s3fs is configured in single-bucket-per-environment mode.

Here's my version report:
