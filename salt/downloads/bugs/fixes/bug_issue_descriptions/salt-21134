I was reading #20711 and happened to notice that commit 18d24ea9 changed host_keys from doing a read() to a readline().strip(), which means it only reads the first line of each file now.  I'm not sure if this was intentional, but it prevents being able to read multi-line private keys (should someone actually want to).  As it stands today, ssh.host_keys simply shows things like this:

```
host01:
    ----------
    dsa:
        -----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    dsa.pub:
        ssh-dss AAAAB3Nza...
    key:
        SSH PRIVATE KEY FILE FORMAT 1.1
    key.pub.pub:
        2048 35 280958967...
    rsa:
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    rsa.pub:
        ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...
```
