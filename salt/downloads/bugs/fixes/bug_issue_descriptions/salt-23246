Hello,

I have an OpenBSD VPS on Vultr, on which I am running a salt master. The problem I am facing has to do with having salt listen on IPv6. 
With the default config (i.e. IPv4) I didn't experience any issues. I then adjusted the /etc/salt/master for IPv6 : 

```
interface: '::'
ipv6: True
```

I then restarted the daemon, but it is not listening on the usual ports : 

```
$ sudo netstat -atn -f inet6 
Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto   Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp6         0      0  *.22                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp6         0      0  fe80::1%lo0.25         *.*                    LISTEN
tcp6         0      0  ::1.25                 *.*                    LISTEN
Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto   Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
udp6         0      0  *.514                  *.* 
```

With the IPv4 configuration I had the following : 

```
$ sudo netstat -atn -f inet          
Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto   Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
tcp          0      0  *.22                   *.*                    LISTEN
tcp          0      0  *.4505                 *.*                    LISTEN
tcp          0      0  127.0.0.1.25           *.*                    LISTEN
tcp          0      0  *.4506                 *.*                    LISTEN
Active Internet connections (including servers)
Proto   Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)    
udp          0      0  *.514                  *.*
```

I believe the issue has to do with the way IPv6 is implemented in saltstack.
I saw this snippet of code in `transport/zeromq.py` : 

```
        if self.opts['ipv6'] is True and hasattr(zmq, 'IPV4ONLY'):                                                                                                                                     
            # IPv6 sockets work for both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses                                                                                                                                       
            self._socket.setsockopt(zmq.IPV4ONLY, 0)
```

This is actually not the case for OpenBSD, where sockets are either IPv4-only or IPv6-only. As per man ip6(4)[1](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man4/ip6.4?query=ip6&sec=4) : 

```
IPV6_V6ONLY int *
Get or set whether only IPv6 connections can be made to this socket. For wildcard sockets, this can restrict connections to IPv6 only. With OpenBSD IPv6 sockets are always IPv6-only, so the socket option is read-only (not modifiable).
```

In other words, there are no IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, so to properly operate in dual-stack environnements a daemon needs to bind and listen on two sockets: one with AF_INET, and one with AF_INET6.

I am not familiar enough with ZeroMQ or the SaltStack to fix this, but I thought I'd report it. Perhaps this needs to be fixed in zmq first, and then make its way into SaltStack

Here is the versions report as well : 

```
$ salt --versions-report

Let me know if I can provide any additional information that may be useful.
