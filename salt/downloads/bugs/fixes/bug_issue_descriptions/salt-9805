Basically I have two environments configured and I have my minions isolated via their configuration file to a specific environment. However when I run state.highstate, minions match up to both top.sls files that reside in different environment definitions.

dev/top.sls

```
dev:
  '*':
    - users
```

test/top.sls

```
test:
  '*':
    - users
```

I have minions whose configuration specifically have environment: test and environment: dev, according to the docs it should isolate them to a specific environment on the master, the behavior indicates otherwise.

Current workaround is to use compound matching and to set the grain environment:dev and then always do 'G@environment:dev|testing' in all my top.sls definitions.
