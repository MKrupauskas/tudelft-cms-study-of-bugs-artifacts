### Description of Issue/Question

I ran a highstate with test=True and got the following stacktrace:

```
server03:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1318, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 722, in highstate
        whitelist=kwargs.get('whitelist')
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 3216, in call_highstate
        self.load_dynamic(matches)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2745, in load_dynamic
        refresh=False)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 562, in sync_all
        ret['states'] = sync_states(saltenv, False)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 291, in sync_states
        ret = _sync('states', saltenv)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 93, in _sync
        ret, touched = salt.utils.extmods.sync(__opts__, form, saltenv=saltenv)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/extmods.py", line 127, in sync
        return ret, touched
    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'touched' referenced before assignment
```

I did have a custom module in `/srv/salt/_modules/` but I got the same error when I removed the module from that directory
