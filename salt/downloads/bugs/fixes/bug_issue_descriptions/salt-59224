**Description**
I have an issue with rendering the configuration template via salt

**Setup**
I have been following salt documentation https://docs.saltstack.com/en/master/topics/network_automation/index.html#cross-platform-configuration-management-example-ntp

So I created the same SLS files and Jinja template

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
After running the command sudo salt router2 state.sls router.ntp ..... I see the following output
```
router2:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering SLS 'ntp' failed. Please see master log for details.
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

and this is from master log file:
```
