pyVmomi 6.0 is now available in PyPi. The check that we're doing in `salt.utils.vmware.get_service_instance` to handle SSL errors works very well for pyVmomi version 5.5.x, but pyVmomi 6.0 does not enter the `if block` [where we're handling SSL errors](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/45f283afa75cdd3c85bbd899a060056e21ff5679/salt/utils/vmware.py#L82).

We need to amend this function so that SSL errors are handled both for pyVmomi 5.5.x and pyVmomi 6.0.

The error I get on 6.0 is:

```
