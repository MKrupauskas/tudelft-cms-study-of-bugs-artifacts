### Description of Issue/Question

When I use the netbox module i.e netbox.openconfig_interfaces I get the error
The netbox execution module cannot be loaded:
pynetbox library is not installed.

It seems that the import of netbox does not work properly. When I comment the line about pynetbox.lib everything works. Please check if pynetbox.lib exists at all.

try:
    import pynetbox
    # from pynetbox.lib import RequestError
    HAS_PYNETBOX = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_PYNETBOX = False
