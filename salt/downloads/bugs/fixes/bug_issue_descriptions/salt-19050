Create two users: pri and sec, both with uid 1234, pri being the first in /etc/passwd.

If you command salt to change ownership of a file to user sec it will do a check afterwards and (of course) finds out it's owned by pri. Salt reports this as an error. It should however resolve the userid of the wanted user (sec) and the actual user (pri) and compare them.

Same goes for groups.

Relevant snippet from salt/modules/file.py:

```
    if user:
        if isinstance(user, int):
            user = uid_to_user(user)
        if user != get_user(name, follow_symlinks=follow_symlinks) and user != '': 
            if __opts__['test'] is True:
                ret['changes']['user'] = user
            else:       
                ret['result'] = False
                ret['comment'].append('Failed to change user to {0}'
                                      .format(user))
        elif 'cuser' in perms and user != '':
            ret['changes']['user'] = user
```
