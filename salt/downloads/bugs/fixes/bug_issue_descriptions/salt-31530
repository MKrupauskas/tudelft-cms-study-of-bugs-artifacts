Hi, 
this issue is based  on the following discussion https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!topic/salt-users/elKOx-T0yFM

In some cases, when we install pkg and create the config for it, salt reporting with  

```
[ERROR   ] JSON Render failed for: 
Permission denied, no authentication information
[ERROR   ] No JSON object could be decoded
```

But actually  state executes normal.
### Actual Behavior

Just to show, that screen package is absent at my system:

```
# salt-ssh -i example.com -r 'rpm -qa|grep screen; ls -l /etc/screenrc'
example.com:
    ----------
    retcode:
        2
    stderr:
        ls: cannot access /etc/screenrc: No such file or directory
    stdout:
```

The first run:

```
mysrv salt # salt-ssh  example.com state.sls tools.screen
[ERROR   ] JSON Render failed for: 
Permission denied, no authentication information
[ERROR   ] No JSON object could be decoded
example.com:
```

Second:

```
mysrv salt # salt-ssh  example.com state.sls tools.screen
example.com:

Summary for example.com
------------
Succeeded: 2
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     2
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt-ssh  example.com -r 'yum -y remove screen; rm /etc/screenrc'`
`salt-ssh  example.com state.sls tools.screen`

### Relevant Logs, Configs, or States

cat tools/screen/init.sls 

```
screen:
  pkg.installed

screenrc:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/screenrc
    - source: salt://tools/screen/.screenrc
    - user: root
    - group: root                                                                    
    - mode: 644
```

The contents of the screenrc doesn't matter.
I also tried to provide config with contents_pillar:
`- contents_pillar: screen:screenrc`
without any success.

roster is trivial:

```
example.com:
  host: example.com
```

The issue reproduces on every of my centos7 srvs, and doesn't reproduces on ubuntu\debian srvs.
Also, this is not screen-related issue. I've got the same issue at my `chrony` module.
