**Description**

I am facing an issue with webhook engine and recent SaltSatack versions.  
It was working well with 2018.3.2 

master conf file use this engine: 
```
engines:
    - webhook:
        port: 5001
```

```
salt-run state.event pretty=True
```
I do see zmq between master and minions 

webhooks from Grafana to SaltStack was working well with 2018.3.2 ... 

but with recent versions, if I send a webhook from Grafana 
or a diy webhook using curl from my mac for testing: 
```
curl -sS http://10.83.28.180:5001/test -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '{"foo": "Foo!", "bar": "Bar!"}'
```
```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "Hello World"}' http://10.83.28.180:5001/test
```
```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"sourceDetail": "", "vlans": {"1": {"dynamic": false, "interfaces": {"Ethernet3": {"privatePromoted": false}, "Ethernet6": {"privatePromoted": false}, "Ethernet7": {"privatePromoted": false}, "Ethernet8": {"privatePromoted": false}}, "name": "default", "status": "active"}}}' http://10.83.28.180:5001/test
```

I have this error message in the event bus: 
```
 salt-run state.event pretty=True

Passed invalid arguments: Object of type 'bytes' is not JSON serializable

Usage:

    Watch Salt's event bus and block until the given tag is matched

    .. versionadded:: 2014.7.0
    .. versionchanged:: 2019.2.0
        ``tagmatch`` can now be either a glob or regular expression.

    This is useful for utilizing Salt's event bus from shell scripts or for
    taking simple actions directly from the CLI.

    Enable debug logging to see ignored events.

    :param tagmatch: the event is written to stdout for each tag that matches
        this glob or regular expression.
    :param count: this number is decremented for each event that matches the
        ``tagmatch`` parameter; pass ``-1`` to listen forever.
    :param quiet: do not print to stdout; just block
    :param sock_dir: path to the Salt master's event socket file.
    :param pretty: Output the JSON all on a single line if ``False`` (useful
        for shell tools); pretty-print the JSON output if ``True``.
    :param node: Watch the minion-side or master-side event bus.
        .. versionadded:: 2016.3.0

    CLI Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Reboot a minion and run highstate when it comes back online
        salt 'jerry' system.reboot && \\
            salt-run state.event 'salt/minion/jerry/start' count=1 quiet=True && \\
            salt 'jerry' state.highstate

        # Reboot multiple minions and run highstate when all are back online
        salt -L 'kevin,stewart,dave' system.reboot && \\
            salt-run state.event 'salt/minion/*/start' count=3 quiet=True && \\
            salt -L 'kevin,stewart,dave' state.highstate

        # Watch the event bus forever in a shell while-loop.
        salt-run state.event | while read -r tag data; do
            echo $tag
            echo $data | jq --color-output .
        done

        See :blob:`tests/eventlisten.sh` for an example of usage within a shell
        script.
