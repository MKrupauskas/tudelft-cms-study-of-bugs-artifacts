### Description of Issue/Question
Running the following execution module results in an error.

```
[root@master ~]# salt minion pkg.upgrade disablerepo=saltstack
minion:
    ERROR: Problem encountered upgrading packages. Additional info follows:
    
    changes:
        ----------
    result:
        ----------
        pid:
            13326
        retcode:
            1
        stderr:
            
            
            Error getting repository data for 'saltstack', repository not found
        stdout:
[root@master ~]#
```

On the minion, it seems that the **_get_extra_options** function used by the **upgrade** member function adds an erroneous **disablerepo** entry with the value passed from the command line being enclosed in single-quotes that causes **yum** to error out.  Here is an excerpt from my `/var/log/salt/minion log`:

`2017-11-17 03:50:59,252 [salt.loader.salt.int.module.cmdmod                    ][ERROR   ][54986] Command '['yum', '--quiet', '-y', '--disablerepo=saltstack', "--disablerepo='saltstack'", 'upgrade']' failed with return code: 1`

I  can duplicate the issue with the following Perl script.

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

system( 'yum', '--quiet', '-y', '--disablerepo=saltstack', "--disablerepo='saltstack'", 'check-update' );
```

Output:
```
[root@minion ~]# ./salt-test-01


Error getting repository data for 'saltstack', repository not found
[root@minion ~]# 
```

This does not error on a (quite old) test **RHEL 5** system I have which is running **salt-2016.11.3-2.el5** .

### Setup
The minion is a Red Hat system with the saltstack repository enabled.  (The repository involved should be arbitrary.)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Execute the following on your Salt Master, replacing `<minion>` with your Red Hat minion's name.

`salt <minion> pkg.upgrade disablerepo=saltstack`

_This should be easily testable since the `yum` command should ABEND when the `disablerepo` option is used with **pkg.upgrade**._
