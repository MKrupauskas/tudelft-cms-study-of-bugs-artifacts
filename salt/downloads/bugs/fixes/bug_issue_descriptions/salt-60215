**Description**

In the `salt.crypt` module we use some logic to determine which crypto library we are using. The logic tries M2Crypto, PyCryptodomex, then PyCrypto. The imports in `salt.utils.crypt` do not try to import M2Crypto or PyCryptodomex. This can have negative side effects. I observed code in the `salt.utils.vt.Terminal` stuck after forking because it was calling `Crypto.Random.reinit` via the `salt.utils.crypt.reinit_crypto` even though PyCryptodomex is installed (PyCryptodomex's version of this method is a no-op).

**Setup**

Install both PyCryptdomex and PyCrypto on the same system. Run cloud deployments.


**Expected behavior**

`salt.utils.crypto` sould not try to import PyCrypto when PyCryptodomex is installed.
