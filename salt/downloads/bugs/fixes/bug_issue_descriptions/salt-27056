The pkgng provider on FreeBSD does not use the "BATCH=yes" environment setting when installing new packages.

This is problematic when installing packages that have an interactive post-install script (e.g. mail/postfix). The lack of the batch flag causes `pkg` to forever wait for a user response (which it will never receive), which in turn causes the minion to "hang".

```
# pkg install -qy postfix
===> Creating users and/or groups.
Using existing group 'mail'.
Creating group 'maildrop' with gid '126'.
Creating group 'postfix' with gid '125'.
Creating user 'postfix' with uid '125'.
Adding user 'postfix' to group 'mail'.
Would you like to activate Postfix in /etc/mail/mailer.conf [n]? ^C
```

But, because the minion is still reachable by the master, your highstate never completes or times out, and you then have to log in, kill the minion child, manually install the package in question, and then restart your highstate run.
