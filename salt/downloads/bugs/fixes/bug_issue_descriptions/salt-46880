### Description of Issue/Question

When rabbitmq_policy attempts to make a change I get an exception the priority is defined as an argument twice.

```
----------
          ID: rabbit_ha_policy
    Function: rabbitmq_policy.present
        Name: ha-all-queues
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1878, in call

                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1823, in wrapper

### Setup

```
rabbit_ha_policy:
  rabbitmq_policy.present:
    - name: ha-all-queues
    - pattern: '.*'
    - definition: '{"ha-mode":"all"}'
    - priority: 0
```

Removing the priority argument from this line (and the one just like it a few lines later) in rabbitmq_priority.py makes this work:
```
            result = __salt__['rabbitmq.set_policy'](vhost,
                                                     name,
                                                     pattern,
                                                     definition,
                                                     apply_to,
                                                     priority=priority,
                                                     runas=runas)
```
