### Description of Issue/Question
When using multi-master and all keys have been accepted, a minion does not connect to the other masters when the first master in the list is down. Another symptom of this problem occurs simply when any master in the list is down

In a docker container test environment with 4 masters and 2 minions, each minion connecting to all masters via dns name, stop the first master. Then restart the two minions. Both of the minions will likely have the following error in the logs and be unresponsive from ay other master that is still up:

```
minion1_1  | [ERROR   ] DNS lookup or connection check of 'master1' failed.
minion1_1  | [ERROR   ] Master hostname: 'master1' not found or not responsive. Retrying in 30 seconds
minion1_1  | [ERROR   ] DNS lookup or connection check of 'master1' failed.
minion1_1  | [ERROR   ] Master hostname: 'master1' not found or not responsive. Retrying in 30 seconds
```

### Setup
My minion configuration for both minions is:

```
[root@minion1 /]# cat /etc/salt/minion
master: 
  - master1
  - master2
  - master3
  - master4

log_level_logfile: trace
master_alive_interval: 20
```

My master configurarion for all masters is:
```
auto_accept: True
log_level_logfile: trace
```
