**Description**

The following pre-commit section relies on `nox-py2`, but it looks like we should be (or maybe are in the process of migrating to) `nox` instead:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/3ea196c9c6885762e30a79b0d59490d7b756327d/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L741-L790

If the repository is ready, and a migration off of `nox-py2` won't cause any disruption in the testing pipeline (or local commit workflow), then we should see about migrating these to use `nox` instead of our custom fork.
