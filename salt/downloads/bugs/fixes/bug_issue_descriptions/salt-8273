As I had problems getting `salt-ssh` to work, I tried the `--priv` command line argument, in addition to the `priv:` roster setting. When I ran `salt-ssh` with `--priv ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, I got the following message (first line may be unrelated):

```
[WARNING ] Warning:  sshpass is not present, so password-based authentication is not available.
/Users/foo/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)?
```

I don't know what the purpose of `--priv` is, and how it relates to `priv:`. (`I wish salt-ssh` had more docs.) But I assume something is going wrong here. Mac OS 10.9, Salt 0.17.1
