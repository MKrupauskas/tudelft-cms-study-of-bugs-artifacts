I put my custom module in file_root dir: PATH/TO/File_Root/base/_modules/,  and run salt '*' saltutil.sync_modules or saltutil.sync_all on salt-master, but minion do not  always reload module successfully. sometimes it's ok, and sometimes not. After restart salt-minion, everythings works fine.

I also read some other opened issue, for instance:
1. #14763 said only modules put in file_root can be synced and reload automaticly by command 'saltutil.sync_modules'. I did.
2. #5840 said the issus has be fixed in 0.16.2, but the issue still ocur in version 2015.5. and the issue remain after run 'saltutil.sync_modules' two times.

FYI:
1. salt-master version: 2015.5.5
2. master os: CentOS 6.5
3. salt-minion version: 2015.5.5
4. minion os: Windows Server 2008 R2
