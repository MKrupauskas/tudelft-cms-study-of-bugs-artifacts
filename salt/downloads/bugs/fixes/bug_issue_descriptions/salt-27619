I had this problem when trying to run this state file:

``` salt
postgresql_install:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: postgresql-9.3
    - refresh: True

add_user:
  postgres_user.present:
    - name: user
    - password: user
    - user: postgres
    - require:
      - pkg: postgresql_install
```

Postrgresql fails to install because of missing dependencies found on the minion log:
![minion_log](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7854083/10243262/57484a04-68ef-11e5-8683-40e3d236fbad.png)

 But instead of the `postgresql_install` state failing, the `add_user` state is executed and I get a KeyError which is caused by the absence of the psql command (postgresql failed to install in the first place):

``` python-traceback
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):

```

It may be a bug with the pkg state module.
I'm using salt-master version **2015.5.5** and **2015.5.3** for the salt-minion
