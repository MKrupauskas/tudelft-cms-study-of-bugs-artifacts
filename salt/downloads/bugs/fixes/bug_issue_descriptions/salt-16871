In the module https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blame/develop/salt/modules/win_useradd.py the "add" method doesn't accept a password parameter, and tries to create the user with a blank password. The comments suggest it should take a password.

I notice that the way the user.present state works, it adds the user as one step and then sets the password, so the win_useradd module is consistent with that.

This creates a problem though - the majority of Windows systems will not allow a user to be added with an empty password, unless the local security policy is changed - and this is probably not a good idea.

I think some special handling for Windows might be required here.
