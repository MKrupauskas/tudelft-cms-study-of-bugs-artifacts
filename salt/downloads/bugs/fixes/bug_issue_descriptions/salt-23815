inotify on a directory
example:
/etc/foo
With recurse and autoadd true  (autoadd seems to be the default btw even though docs/code seem to think false)

```
mkdir /etc/foo/bar
[CRITICAL] Beacon processing errored: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 890, in _process_beacons
