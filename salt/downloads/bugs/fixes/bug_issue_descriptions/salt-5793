```
salt-call state.single file.managed name=/tmp/test user=root group=root mode=440 replace=False
```

```
salt-call state.single file.managed name=/tmp/test user=root group=root mode=440 replace=False content='#for local content'
```

Both of these will create the file on first pass, and then set the permissions on the second pass. I have not tested with a source specified.
