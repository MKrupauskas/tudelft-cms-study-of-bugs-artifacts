Here is my state:

```
    nginx:
      service:
        - running
        - enable: True
```

And, here is the relevant debugging output:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state service.running for nginx
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/service nginx status' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/chkconfig --list nginx' in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] stdout: nginx            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/runlevel' in directory '/root'
[DEBUG   ] output: N 3
[INFO    ] Service nginx is already enabled, and is in the desired state
```

And, here is the output:

```
local:
----------
    State: - service
    Name:      nginx
    Function:  running
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Service nginx is already enabled, and is in the desired state
        Changes:

However, nginx is not running.
