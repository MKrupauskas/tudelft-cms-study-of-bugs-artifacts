##### Description

Auto-order does not work when using template code snippets in the states.
##### Environment

Master: CentOS 6.5, salt-master 2014.1.4
Minion: CentOS 6.5, salt-minion 2014.1.4
##### SLS

```
{% set need_install = salt['cmd.script']('salt://chk_require_ver.sh', ...) %}
{% if need_install.retcode %}
..... Here will not be in the sequence of auto-order.
{% endif %}
```
##### Summary

It's unexpected the running sequence of the `state.show_lowstate`.

Before fix this issue, have any suggestion for running states depends on the specified result(stdout/retcode) of cmd.run(script) and in the expected running sequence?
It will helps me a lot to moving deploy code to SaltStack from others.
