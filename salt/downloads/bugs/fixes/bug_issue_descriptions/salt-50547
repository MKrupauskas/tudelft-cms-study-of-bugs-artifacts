man pw:
pw [-R rootdir] [-V etcdir] usershow [-n] name|uid | -u uid [-F] [-P]
        [-7] [-a]

If I add a user that is all numeric, by default it thinks I'm searching for uid instead of name.  To 'force' it to show name, I need to use the '-n' option.

freebsd:# pw useradd -n 12345
freebsd:# pw usershow 12345
pw: no such uid `12345'
freebsd:# pw usershow -n 12345
12345:*:3692:3692::0:0:User &:/home/12345:/bin/sh
freebsd:# pw usershow -u 3692
12345:*:3692:3692::0:0:User &:/home/12345:/bin/sh
freebsd:#

this fixes the issue:

freebsd:# diff "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/bsd_shadow.py" "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/bsd_shadow.py.orig"

### Setup
