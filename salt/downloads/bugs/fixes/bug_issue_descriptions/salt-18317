According to the documentation here: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.publish.html#salt.modules.publish.publish
You're supposed to be able to send in a comma-separated list in a string that will be matched against the positional arguments that the module call you're making. This no longer works. I traced it to this commit: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/36fa800821173a4bb1efc950d92b58602c232304
And this issue: #13294
It seems that the argument parser was switched out to a YAML-like parsing style. This lead me to trying a few other types of syntax including YAML style "[item1, item2]" and Python style "['item1', 'item2']" without success. I will locally revert the publish module since it seems that this is a larger issue than just a simple patch.
