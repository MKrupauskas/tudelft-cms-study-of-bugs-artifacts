In the debug log, I can see that `salt-ssh` reads the master configuration file located in the directory passed via `--config-dir`. However, `salt-ssh` doesn't seem to honor the `file_roots` configuration option, and instead only looks in the default location `/srv/salt` (which isn't even listed in my `file_roots`). As a result, it can't find any states passed to `state.sls`. As soon as I copy state files into `/srv/salt`, things start to work. Mac OS 10.9, Salt 0.17.1.

To troubleshoot this problem, it would help if Salt not only logged `[ERROR   ] No matching sls found for 'foo' in env 'base'`, but also the locations it searched.
