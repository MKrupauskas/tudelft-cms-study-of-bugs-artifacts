### Description of Issue
The `file.managed` state is said to have a `contents_newline` argument which can optionally be specified (as `False`) to prevent a newline from being appended to the end of the managed file when used in conjunction with `contents`, `contents_grains`, or `contents_pillars`.  However, in 2018.3.4 and 2019.2, a newline is currently always added -- looks to be an unintended side-effect of #51252.

Namely this logic block:
```python
            for part in validated_contents:
                for line in part.splitlines():
                    contents += line.rstrip('\n').rstrip('\r') + os.linesep
            if contents_newline and not contents.endswith(os.linesep):
                contents += os.linesep
```

The problem is that `os.linesep` is *always* applied to the last line as a result of the for loop -- the `if` statement does not work as intended because the line will *always* end in `os.linesep` already (unless contents is `[]`).

### Setup
```yaml
manage-rabbitmq-erlang-cookie:
  file.managed:
    - name: /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
    - contents:
      - SOME_EXAMPLE_COOKIE
    - contents_newline: False
    - user: rabbitmq
    - group: rabbitmq
    - mode: 0400
    - watch_in:
      - service: rabbitmq-server
```

(removing the `watch_in` requisite of course!)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply the above state - the managed file should not have a newline at the end... but it will.
