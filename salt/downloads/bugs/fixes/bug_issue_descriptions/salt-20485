In the newest "stable" version, the presence of the `if_missing` attribute on `archive.extracted` causes a failure. For example:

``` yml
consul-template-archive:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /tmp/
    - source: https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/releases/download/v0.4.0/consul-template_0.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    - source_hash: md5=46e46b1ce37e7784746826dc833e2e86
    - archive_format: tar
    - tar_options: v
    - if_missing: /usr/local/bin/consul-template
```

results in:

```
          ID: consul-template-archive
    Function: archive.extracted
        Name: /tmp/
      Result: False

                  tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
              stdout:

Of course, removing if_missing makes it work, but we shouldn't have to download a file on every highstate.

Just to rant for a moment, there's been a lot of instability with the `archive.extracted` state lately... we bootstrap and try to keep our machines on latest "stable" salt binaries, but it has been far from stable over the past few months and has really been messing things up on our end. Is it generally recommended to do this, or do most people just pick a specific minor version and ignore future changes?
