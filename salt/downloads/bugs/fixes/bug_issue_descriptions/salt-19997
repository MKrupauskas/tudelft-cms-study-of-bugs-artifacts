When trying to use a hgfs fileserver backend, I encounter problems. Running fileserver.update results in the following:
## Problem:

```
salt$ sudo salt-run fileserver.update
[ERROR ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

hglib.error.CommandError: (1, '', '') 
```

I've diagnosed the problem as due to hgfs.py initializing a cache of the remote repo at `/var/cache/salt/master/hgfs/<some hash of the repo>/`. Then, the config step checks for the default path of the cache repo using `refs = repo.config(names='paths')`, which translates to `hg showconfig paths`.

However, because this is a freshly inited repo, it does not have any paths configured. This means that `hg showconfig paths` has a return code of 1.

The command is issued by hglib.client.rawcommand, which takes a flag `eh` if errors are supposed to be handled gracefully. This flag isn't set in this case, so an Exception is raised which is not handled.
## Workaround:

I've a workaround in place for this, by manually populating the file .hg/hgrc of the cached repo, subsequent calls to fileserver.update will work correctly.
