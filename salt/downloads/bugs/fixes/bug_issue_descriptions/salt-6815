To reproduce with `salt 0.16.3`:
1. Install `rvm` locally for a user (say, `rvmuser`) not systemwide (say, in the user's `$HOME/.rvm/...`)
2. Install a ruby (say `1.9.3`) and create a test gemset (say `testgemset`)
3. As root, `salt-call gem.install ruby=1.9.3@testgemset runas=rvmuser some_gem`

Actual result: 

`some_gem` is installed in the `default` gemset.

Expected:

`some_gem` should be installed in `testgemset` instead.

I have a guess where things go wrong. The `modules/gem.py::_gem()` method inspects `__salt__['rvm.is_installed']()` to decide whether to install the gem with `rvm.do`, but unfortunately, it seems to be testing `rvm.is_installed` for the current user, not the `runas` user. If `rvm` is installed locally rather than systemwide, it seems like this will break? This is my first 5 minutes looking at salt's code, so I'm likely missing something.
