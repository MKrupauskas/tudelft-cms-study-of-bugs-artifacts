**Description**
The function `shadow.gen_password ` crash with the error message
```
PID check failed. RNG must be re-initialized after fork(). Hint: Try Random.atfork()
```

**Setup**
I think no special configuration is required for this issue.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
[root@salt-master:/srv (master)]# salt salt-master.local shadow.gen_password 'I_am_password' 
salt-master.local:
    ERROR: PID check failed. RNG must be re-initialized after fork(). Hint: Try Random.atfork()
```

**Expected behavior**
Salt should generate an hashed password.

**Additional context**
No problem found in version 2019.2.0 but a system update has been done meanwhile, so some Debian Python 3 packages can have be changed too.
