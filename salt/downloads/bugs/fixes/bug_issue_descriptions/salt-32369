### Description of Issue/Question

dockerng.running restarts my images every time and fails giving this error:

Failed to apply configuration for the following parameters: labels
### Setup

``` sls
docker.:443/atomic/pyal:{{ salt['pillar.get']('version') }}:
  dockerng.image_present:
    - force: True

pyal:
  dockerng.running:
    - name: pyal
    - image: docker:443/atomic/pyal:{{ salt['pillar.get']('version') }}
    - user: user
    - network_mode: bridge
    - labels:
      - pyal: latest
    - restart_policy: on-failure:5
    - ports:
      - "8000/tcp"
    - port_bindings:
      - 127.0.0.1:8000:8000
    - detach: true
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I was also getting similar errors for "user" and "network_mode" until I added them to the state.   Adding them fixed those, but adding "labels" did not.
