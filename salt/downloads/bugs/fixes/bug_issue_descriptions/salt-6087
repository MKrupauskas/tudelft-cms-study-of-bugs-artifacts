Several packages manage users/groups in order to run their daemons (for instance, mysql). However, this is not guaranteed and in the end it's up to the administrator to decide whether he would like to run the package with the default user/group that the package was bundled with.

In this spirit, I am guaranteeing that a given user/group is present on the machine to run that daemon. Nonetheless, if a package has already added that group, then `groupadd` fails with "group '<group>' already exists".

This produces an error when executing the state, which makes other dependent states fail too. My question is whether this behaviour should silently report as "no changes required" or not.

Sample output:

```
[salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ] Command 'groupadd mysql' failed with return code:
[salt.loaded.int.module.cmdmod][ERROR   ] stderr: groupadd: group 'mysql' already exists
```

Thanks for the clarifications.
