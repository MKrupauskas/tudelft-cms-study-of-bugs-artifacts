Command looks this:
salt 'db-01' cp.push /var/backups/some.tar.gz

The file downloaded has same size, but the md4sum is different. And gunzip cannot unzip - the original file can be unzipped.

I test same command in other server but different gzip files, looks fine.
I also test this command in same server but a small text file, looks fine as well...
