### Description of Issue/Question

I cannot target grains with wildcards in more complicated nested grains structures. 
### Setup

```
[root@localhost integration]# cat /etc/salt/grains 
test:
- test1:
    int:
    - test2: active
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Add the grains structure above
2. I can target the grains without wildcards without an issue:

```
[root@localhost integration]# salt -G 'test:test1:int:test2:active' test.ping
10.0.2.15:
    True
```

I can target with a wildcard on the first list in the nested structure and the last grain:

```
[root@localhost integration]# salt -G 'test:*:int:test2:active' test.ping
10.0.2.15:
    True
```

```
[root@localhost integration]# salt -G 'test:test1:int:test2:*' test.ping
10.0.2.15:
    True
```
1. [ISSUE]: I cannot target the grains like so:

```
[root@localhost integration]# salt -G 'test:test1:int:*:active' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```

and

```
[root@localhost integration]# salt -G 'test:test1:*:test2:active' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
