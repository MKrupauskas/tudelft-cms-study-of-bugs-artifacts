When installing salt via bootstrap with a master, the master processes fail to start. Here's the error:

```
 *  INFO: Running install_fedora_check_services()
 *  INFO: Running install_fedora_restart_daemons()
Job for salt-master.service failed. See 'systemctl status salt-master.service' and 'journalctl -xn' for details.
 *  INFO: Running daemons_running()
 * ERROR: salt-master was not found running
 * ERROR: Failed to run daemons_running()!!!
 * ERROR: salt-minion was not found running. Pass '-D' to bootstrap-salt.sh when bootstrapping for additional debugging information...
 * ERROR: salt-master was not found running. Pass '-D' to bootstrap-salt.sh when bootstrapping for additional debugging information...
```

If I start the process after the failure with `systemctl start salt-master` everything runs just fine.
