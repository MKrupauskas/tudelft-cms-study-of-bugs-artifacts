the changes in #14687 lead to the client being unable to install software.

```
The error message the user gets is:
    [ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1379, in call
        **cdata['kwargs'])
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 468, in installed
        **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 161, in _find_install_targets
        cver = cur_pkgs.get(name, [])
    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

The bug can be fixed either by 
1. installing python-apt or
2. reverting commit 241de03c0dae23793e4175309ea5b7ea11905b2b

If python-apt needs to be installed for new versions of salt, then a proper fix would be to add 'python-apt' to package-dependencies of 'salt-common'
