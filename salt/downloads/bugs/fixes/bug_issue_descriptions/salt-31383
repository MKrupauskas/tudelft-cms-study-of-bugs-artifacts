Tested on opensuse_leap42.1.

how to reproduce:

In a new installed machine, with new salt-Minion, before setup the minion itself (so minion-salt-service isn't started)
- change the hostname via hostname "NEWHOST"
- change the file etc/hostname = "NEWHOST".
- don't change the file /etc/hosts

```
cat /etc/hosts
...
127.0.0.2 OLDHOSTNAM
```

```
python -c \'import socket;print  socket.getfqdn()\ '
"NEWHOST"
```

start the salt-minion-service.

minion_id = OLD
# 

If i modify the /etc/hosts, with the "NEWHOST", then  ;
minion_id= "NEWHOST"

I don't know if is an issue on the documentation or the network.py file, because 
according  the official one documentation , minion_id is setting:
1)The Python function socket.getfqdn() is run
2)/etc/hostname is checked (non-Windows only)
3)/etc/hosts
- i was thinking that for minion_id was : 1 OR 2 OR 3 and not 1 & 2 & 3  
- issue similar : #25719
