### Description of Issue/Question

Sometimes when you have an error ocurr with the proxmox driver you end up with a pretty empty message that doesn't provide any clues as to the cause, even when logging is set to trace:

```
[DEBUG   ] Preparing to generate a node using these parameters: {u'ostype': u'other', u'vmid': 107, u'name': u'newcentos.int.wsl'} 
[DEBUG   ] post: https://proxmox:8006/api2/json/nodes/newnode/qemu/102/clone ({u'full': 1, u'newid': 107, u'format': u'qcow2'})
[DEBUG   ] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): proxmox:8006
[DEBUG   ] https://proxmox:8006 "POST /api2/json/nodes/newnode/qemu/102/clone HTTP/1.1" 200 93
Usage: salt-cloud [options] <-m MAP | -p PROFILE> <NAME> [NAME2 ...]

salt-cloud: error: That was a profile error: 
[root@mgm-002 cloud]# 
```

This is rather unhelpful.

I will do a quick PR to fix at least one of these occasions, as I've just tripped over it.

### Setup

Use a proxmox profile that doesn't have a `ip_address` field set.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

As Setup, try deploying the profile.
