### Description of Issue/Question

'salt-cloud -a show_instance' fails with TypeError on EC2 instances. Releases starting from v2016.3.0 are affected.

It's reborn #33162, which was fixed by #33164 on 2015.8 but appeared again on 2016.3 after #33164 was merged into it (679200aeb2fd) because of changed return value of _get_node.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Given an EC2 instance named 'foo1'

```
(py2-env) salt-test@tommynaut:~> salt-cloud -l debug -y -a show_instance foo1
...                                                                          
[ERROR   ] There was an error actioning machines: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
