Hi,

We are experiencing some issues with git on Windows machines. The problem is that the "git pull"-command is executed very slowly. I'm not sure if this is a Salt issue, Git issue or a Windows issue. 

Example

```
root@saltmaster:~# time salt 'host.domain.com' git.pull C:/tmp
host.domain.com:
    Already up-to-date.

real    0m48.787s
user    0m0.264s
sys     0m0.080s
```

```
root@saltmaster:~# time salt 'host.domain.com' cmd.run 'cd C:/tmp & git pull'
host.domain.com:
    Already up-to-date.

real    0m48.790s
user    0m0.288s
sys     0m0.044s

```

It works fine if you are using cmd from Windows to execute "git pull". Other git-command (clone, add, commit, push) via Salt works without any issues at all, and are all finished within a couple of seconds. 

If you start Salt Minion on the Windows Machine directly from cmd (salt-minion.exe -c c:\salt\conf as an example) it works and you will get a fast response. An example where I run the same command but the minion is started via cmd instead of as a service:

```
root@saltmaster:~# time salt 'host.domain.com' git.pull C:/tmp
host.domain.com:
    Already up-to-date.

real    0m0.812s
user    0m0.284s
sys     0m0.040s
```

We have tried with:

Git versions:
Git-1.9.5-preview20141217
Git-1.9.2-preview20140411

Windows OS:
Windows Server 2012
Windows 2008 R2 Standard

Salt Minion versions:
2014.7.1
2014.7.0

Salt Master versions:
2014.7.0
2014.1.13 

Any ideas? Have I done something stupid (it has happened before!)? I tried to search for similiar issues but didn't find anything. 

Thanks in advance
