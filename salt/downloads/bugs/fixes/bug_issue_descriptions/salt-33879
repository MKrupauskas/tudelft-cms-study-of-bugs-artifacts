### Description of Issue/Question

On the head of 2016.3 when testing the fix for issue #32446 there is no return for remote minions. I am expecting the following error: `ERROR: This command can only be executed on a minion that is located on the master.`
### Setup
1. 2 minioins connected to a master. One of them local and one of them remote
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. run the following: `salt '*' saltutil.wheel minions.connected`
2. And you will see that the remote minion does not return anything:

```
root@ip-10-95-162-59:~/salt# salt '*' saltutil.wheel minions.connected -lwarning
masterminion:
    - masterminion
    - remoteminion
remoteminion:
```
