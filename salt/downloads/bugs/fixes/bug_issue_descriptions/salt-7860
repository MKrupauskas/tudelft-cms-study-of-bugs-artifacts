In general it seems like anything that allows for makedirs should also expose dir_mode, otherwise doing something like

```
  file.managed:
    - name: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/deploy_key
    - user: ubuntu
    - group: ubuntu
    - mode: 600
    - makedirs: True
    - contents_pillar: 'deploy_key:ec2'
```

renders the key unusable since .ssh is created with mode 600.
