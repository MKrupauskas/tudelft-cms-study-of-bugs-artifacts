I am unable to find a way to feed kwargs through the salt-run state.orchestrate orchestration. 

```
test salt.function:
  salt.function:
    - name: cmd.run
    - tgt: ursa
   - arg:
     - cd /tmp && pwd && whoami
   - kwarg:
       runas: nobody
```

returns 

```
ursa_master:
----------
          ID: test salt.function
    Function: salt.function
        Name: cmd.run
      Result: True
     Comment: Function ran successfully. Function cmd.run ran on ursa.

              root
    Warnings: 'runas' is an invalid keyword argument for 'salt.function'. If you
              were trying to pass additional data to be used in a template
              context, please populate 'context' with 'key: value' pairs. Your
              approach will work until Salt Carbon is out. Please update your
              state files.

```

tried a good variation of combinations like 

```
   - kwarg:
      context:
         runas: nobody
```

with no luck. 

Can't find a way to get it to work. Is it broken or is the documentation incomplete ?
