```

Here's the state:

``` yaml
s3_file:
  archive.extracted:
    - source: s3://{{ s3_path }}
    - source_hash: sha256={{ hash }}
    - name: /opt/topology/{{ release_tag }}
    - archive_format: tar
    - failhard: true
```

The directory that is supposed to be extracted to is created, but empty. I can reproduce this by running `salt-call state.highstate` on the minion and then immediately doing `salt minion state.highstate queue=True` on the master. The salt-call succeeds, and the queued highstate fails as above. Other file.managed states succeed, so it seems to be specific to archive.extracted.
