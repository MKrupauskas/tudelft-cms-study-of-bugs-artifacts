### Description of Issue

Any scheduled job that is defined through pillar and has `run_on_start: true`, runs on each pillar refresh (even if unchanged), thus ignoring the scheduled interval

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Pillar:
```
schedule:
  test_schedule:
    function: test.ping
    minutes: 1
    run_on_start: true
```

Now run `saltutil.refresh_pillar` and watch the minion log for `test_schedule`.
