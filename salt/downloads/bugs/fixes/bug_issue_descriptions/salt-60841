**Description**

After upgrading from Salt 3003 to 3003.3, access to Salt-API using CherryPy does not work anymore. Login seems to never work.
*(in previous attempts, login was working but queries not... I can't reproduce this now)*

**Setup**

- server runs on Debian 9
- Salt version was 3003 before upgrading to 3003.3. I tested all versions between those and it breaks since 3003.2
- API uses file backend for external auth

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

- salt-master in version 3003.2 or 3003.3
- configuration of the master
```
rest_cherrypy:
  disable_ssl: False
  host: 0.0.0.0
  ssl_crt: /etc/ssl/certs/<your_cert>.pem
  ssl_key: /etc/ssl/private/<your_key>.key
  port: <port_number>

external_auth:
  file:
    ^filename: '/etc/salt/eauth_users.txt'
```

Using `httpie` to query salt-api

```
$ http POST https://salt-dev.fraudbuster.mobi:15847/login username=<username> password='<password>' eauth=file -j
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain
```
logs on server side
```

    for x in QUOTED_SLASH_REGEX.split(path)
AttributeError: module 'six.moves.urllib_parse' has no attribute 'unquote_to_bytes'
```

**Expected behavior**

I expect the login process to complete and return me a Token usable in another query on salt-api.
