**Description**
The value of the `virtual` grain in an LXC container depends on the command being used.

On a clean Debian install, Salt will use the `systemd-detect-virt` command and report the virtual type as `LXC`. If you then install `virt-what`, the output changes to `lxc`.

Looking through `salt/grains/core.py`, it seems quite obvious what's going on.

With systemd-detect-virt, Salt is manually upper-casing the value to `LXC`: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/28f4c05280bc1a5cf2b9011eb26112641fe8b9fa/salt/grains/core.py#L860

With virt-what, the lowercase value `lxc` is used: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/28f4c05280bc1a5cf2b9011eb26112641fe8b9fa/salt/grains/core.py#L867

With the sysctl approach, the code suggests the value would be `container` with the subtype being `LXC`: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/28f4c05280bc1a5cf2b9011eb26112641fe8b9fa/salt/grains/core.py#L1035

**Setup**

First, start and enter an LXC container. I have tested this using LXD packaged through Snap on Ubuntu 20.10, but other LXD distributions likely suffer from the same issues.

```bash
lxc launch images:debian/buster example
lxc exec example bash
```
Then, run the following in the container:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install curl
mkdir -p /etc/salt/minion.d
echo "master: 127.0.0.1" > /etc/salt/minion.d/master.conf

curl -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com -o install_salt.sh
sh install_salt.sh -P -M -x python3

salt-key -A
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

In the container, run the following commands:

```bash
salt-call grains.get virtual
> LXC
apt-get install virt-what
salt-call grains.get virtual
> lxc
```

**Expected behavior**

The `virtual` and `virtual_subtype` grains are consistent on all LXC containers, regardless of guest OS used or system utilities is installed.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether that's `container`, `LXC` or `lxc`, as long as I'm guaranteed to have one of these consistently.
