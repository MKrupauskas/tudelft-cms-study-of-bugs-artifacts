Hi,

I'm trying to migrate some servers to systemd (using salt). The regular installation failed w/

```
E: There are problems and -y was used without --force-yes
```

Because systemd-sysv conflicts w/ sysvinit (as it provides its own /sbin/init).

On IRC I was told to add (the undocumented option) `- force_yes: True` to the state file. I did. Now I get this error:

```
You are about to do something potentially harmful.
To continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'
 ?] Abort.
```

Is there a way to install `systemd-sysv` on a salt minion without doing this manually?
