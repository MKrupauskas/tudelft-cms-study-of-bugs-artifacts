Just found: Add VirtuozzoLinux is yumpkg enable list. #34878 so this may be fixed?

```
salt 'hw38.*' pkg.list_pkgs
hw38.conetix.com.au:
    Module 'pkg' is not available.
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

Previously worked fine for 2 years and now returns this error on 7 nodes out of 8. Config file on minion is default with master: line set accordingly. Server is CloudLinux running Virtuozzo Containers. salt-minion service restarted several times. 

The only issue I can find is that on the **working** node the line:
