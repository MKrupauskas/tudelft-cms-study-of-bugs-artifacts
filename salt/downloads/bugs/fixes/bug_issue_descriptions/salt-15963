Hi,
I have a setup described as in [https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/15442]. 
The problem i am facing is when i try to do remote execution in a minion and if high state is running at that point in that minion.

The remote execution says "Minion did not return".
Upon looking into logs, minion got the job but return the output.
What could be the possible issue?
