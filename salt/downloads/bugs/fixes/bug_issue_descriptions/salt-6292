This was brought up on the mailing list. The reason for this is that `pkg.latest_version` is run each time, and does not pass through the `refresh` value. As `latest_version` defaults to `refresh=True`, this ensures a refresh every time.

The intended behavior is for a refresh tag to be generated once per salt run (in `mod_init()`), and the existence of this file is used to limit only one refresh per salt run, unless `refresh=True` is used.

The solution here is to move the rtag check to the `latest_version` call, and pass `refresh=False` to `__salt__['pkg.install']()`.

Working on a fix now.
