**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
While Salt supported both Python 2 and Python 3, it had to support it's own [fork of the nox package](https://github.com/s0undt3ch/nox/tree/hotfix/py2-release).
Now that Salt is Python3 only, we should move to the [upstream nox package](https://github.com/theacodes/nox).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Provide a way to support both our nox fork and upstream nox to ease the migration process.
