    for job in list(self.opts["schedule"].keys()):
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'keys'
```

Also note:

```
# salt-call schedule.list show_all=True
local:
    ----------
    schedule:
        ----------
```

Is this the same schedule this code is assuming exists without any null safe protection around trying to get a list of keys?
