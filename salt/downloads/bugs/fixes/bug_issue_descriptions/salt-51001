### Description of Issue/Question
As per the documentation the clone_from option should be an integer https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/cloud/proxmox.html - however this causes a ValueError exception as we're trying to iterate it looking for a colon character `:`.

It looks like someone has extended the clone_from feature to allow cloning from a machine on a different host, but broke the simple use case at the same time and/or didn't communicate their intention of how this is supposed to work through the documentation.

### Setup
Latest develop branch, proxmox and a machine to clone. With a profile that uses an integer for the clone_from setting as per documentation

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Try to create a new machine from a clone of another machine with clone_from set as an integer.

### Versions Report
Latest develop branch
