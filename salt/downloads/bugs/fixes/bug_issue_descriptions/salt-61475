**Description**
Hello!
Our auditing tool detected a deprecated version of python3 (python 3.6) installed on all our Rocky/Alma Linux minions.

The last version of python 3.6 available in AlmaLinux is python 3.6.8, which, according to [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) page, is end of life and should not be used anymore.
If I understood this correctly, this is a packaging issue.

**Setup**
Fully up to date AlmaLinux VM, with `python36` module disabled (see below).
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
* Install the salt-repo as in the [Download page](https://repo.saltproject.io/#rhel)
* Run `dnf remove python36` to remove python 3.6 - salt will be removed as well, as it's dependencies are not fulfilled anymore.
* Run `dnf module disable python36`
* Try to install salt again, which leads to this error:
```
dnf install salt-minion

Error:
 Problem: package salt-minion-3004-1.el8.noarch requires /usr/bin/python3.6, but none of the providers can be installed
  - conflicting requests
  - package python36-3.6.8-38.module_el8.5.0+2569+5c5719bc.x86_64 is filtered out by modular filtering
(try to add '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
```

**Expected behavior**
Package should install, with python 3.8 as dependency.
