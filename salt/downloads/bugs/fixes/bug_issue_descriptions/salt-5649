With the default configuration of not specifying the interface ip to listen on in /etc/salt/master, the basic "salt '*' test.ping" timeouts after 60 seconds on OpenBSD. salt-master and salt-minion can talk to each other without issues (i see them exchanging keys at their startup), and i've accepted the minion key (and it's listed in salt-key -L)

Looking at ktrace, the salt process tries to connect to 0.0.0.0:4506 which wont work...

Without interface configuration, the salt-master process correctly listens on any interface (ie i have *:4506 + *:4505 in netstat/fstat)

If i specify 127.0.0.1 or a real public ip in the master config (and change minion configuration accordingly), it works fine.
