**Description**
We need to be able to add multiple networks to a Rackspace cloud server when spinning it up using salt-cloud.  This is especially important for `Rackconnected` devices which we need to be attached to their internal RC network and not have an external public IP.

Currently documentation suggests this should be possible,
```
- **network**: (optional) Network dict or name or ID to attach the
              server to.  Mutually exclusive with the nics parameter.
              Can also be be a list of network names or IDs or
              network dicts.
```
.. but has a test which prevents passing multiple items as a list:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/cloud/clouds/openstack.py#L633

**Setup**
`/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/example.conf`
```
exampleprovider:
  minion:
    master: 172.19.117.1
  driver: openstack
  profile: rackspace
  auth:
    username: exampleuser
    api_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  region_name: LON
  auth_type: rackspace_apikey
  networks:
    - name: ef16674f-0b0a-4ead-b4a1-1bfc721ecf2b
    - name: 1111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
`/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/centos_7.conf`
```
centos_7:
  provider: exampleprovider
  image: fa756e3a-0fe3-4bbf-8f78-e675d8968142
  size: 2 GB General Purpose v1
  com.rackspace__1__build_config_options: backup_defaults,monitoring_defaults,updates
```
**Steps to Reproduce the behaviour**
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant)
```
[root@salt-master clouds]# salt-cloud -p centos_7 s01.example.com |tee s01.example.com
[ERROR   ] Error network: [{'id': '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'}, {'id': 'ef16674f-0b0a-4ead-b4a1-1bfc721ecf2b'}] is not of type <class 'dict'>
[ERROR   ] Error key_name: None is not of type (<class 'str'>,)
```
--- I was able to workaround by changing line 633 to 
```
        'network': (dict,list),
```

**Expected behaviour**
Server would be built with the specific networks attached but no others
