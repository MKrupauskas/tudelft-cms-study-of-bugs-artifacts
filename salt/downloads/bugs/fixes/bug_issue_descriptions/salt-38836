### Description of Issue/Question

I have a simple state to download a binary file into my home directory from S3. I have an IAM role for my EC2 instance that provides full access to the S3 bucket. Manually running `salt-call s3.get mys3bucket /infrastructure/atlassian/atlassian-servicedesk-3.2.6-x64.bin` works just fine. Tried Googling for `Exception: 'FSClient' object has no attribute 'utils'` and I couldn't find anything useful.

### Setup

Currently running masterless with GitFS Backend 
```
[root@amznlinux gitfs]# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/0.conf
master: localhost
file_client: local
fileserver_backend:
  - git
gitfs_provider: gitpython
gitfs_remotes:
  - git@github.com:myprivaterepo/repo.git
gitfs_root: srv/salt
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/pillars/dev
minion_data_cache: False
```
```
jira_sd_binary:
  file.managed:
    - source: s3://mys3bucket/infrastructure/atlassian/atlassian-servicedesk-3.2.6-x64.bin
    - name: /home/ec2-user/atlassian-servicedesk-3.2.6-x64.bin
    - skip_verify: true
    - unless: ls /home/ec2-user/atlassian-servicedesk-3.2.6-x64.bin
    - order: 1
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
[root@amznlinux gitfs]# salt-call state.highstate
