### Description of Issue/Question

If mysql's `lower_case_table_names` variable is `1` or `2`, then the `mysql_grants.present` state will fail for any table containing a capital letter.

To everyone else reading, please remember never to use camel-cased database or table names in MySQL. It will lead you down a path of endless pain and misery. Keep it all lowercase. Salt is not the first program to trip up on this, and probably won't be the last.

### Setup

```yaml
mysql_perms_SomeDB:
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: 'ALL PRIVILEGES'
    - database: 'SomeDB.*'
    - user: myuser
    - host: localhost
```

Run `mysqld` with `--lower-case-table-names=1`, then create a `SomeDB` database and a `myuser` user. If you're on a case-insensitive filesystem, it may also be worth testing with `--lower-case-table-names=2`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Set up as described above
2. After creating the new database on the newly configured `mysqld`, run the salt state
3. Observe reported failure, while the grant in fact succeeded
