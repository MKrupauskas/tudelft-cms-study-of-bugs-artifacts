### Description of Issue
When setting a logrotate configuration using the logrotate state, and a config file other than the default is specified, the logrotate state doesn't create it if it's not already present. This means on a fresh system, all logrotate configuration has to be a two-part operation, where the empty file is created first and then config is added to it after. It'd be better behaviour create the file if it doesn't exist, as part of this state.

### Setup
```yaml
logrotate_config:
  logrotate.set:
    - key: rotate
    - value: 5
    - conf_file: /etc/logrotate.d/defaults
```
