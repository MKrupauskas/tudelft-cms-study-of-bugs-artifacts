### Description of Issue/Question
In salt/modules/rh_ip.py when trying to access the opts element for nozeroconf the `o` was omitted from the word zero:
nozeroconf = salt.utils.dequote(opts['nozerconf'])
it should be:
nozeroconf = salt.utils.dequote(opts['nozeroconf'])

This looks to be in versions from 2016.11.6 and up:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2016.11/salt/modules/rh_ip.py#L831
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7/salt/modules/rh_ip.py#L843
