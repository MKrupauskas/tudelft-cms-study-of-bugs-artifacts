From today's "Introduction to Salt's Event Reactor System" lecture at SaltConf15 we discussed the fact that a minion can send an unlimited amount of data in a payload to the master providing a potential avenue for any compromised minion to bring down the master.

This issue is to find a solution to that, and should be a high priority.
