If you run through and use the nova provider, if you have references to the cloud modules or states and use the nova provider, you get the above error if you haven't installed and restarted salt-minion.

This is caused by the fact that salt/utils/openstack/nova.py needs a restart of salt-minion to reload itself and see the novaclient library.
