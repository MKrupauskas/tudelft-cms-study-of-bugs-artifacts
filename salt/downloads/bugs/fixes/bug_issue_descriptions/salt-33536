pkgrepo.managed does not disable a yum repo with "disabled: True"

```
percona:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Percona-Release YUM repository - $basearch
    - baseurl: http://repo.percona.com/release/$releasever/RPMS/$basearch
    - key_url: https://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona
    - gpgcheck: 0
    - disabled: True <==
```

The result is a /etc/yum.repos/percona.repo as follows:

```
[percona]
gpgcheck=0
key_url=https://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona
enabled=1 <==
name=Percona-Release YUM repository - $basearch
baseurl=http://repo.percona.com/release/$releasever/RPMS/$basearch
```
