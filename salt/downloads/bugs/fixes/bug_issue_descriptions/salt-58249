**Description**
When processing sls in root directory of file roots, `tplfile` context variable  is not set

**Setup**
standard file roots

create a `tplfile.sls` on the top level with following contents:
```
test:
  test.nop:
    - name: tplfile is "{{ tplfile }}"
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

run `salt-call state.show_sls tplfile --output=yaml`

result:
```
# [INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
local:
  test:
    test:
    - name: tplfile is ""
    - nop
    - order: 10000
    __sls__: tplfile
    __env__: base
```
As you see, tplfile, which should be `tplfile.sls` is not set

**Expected behavior**
expect tplfile to be set to `tplfile.sls`
