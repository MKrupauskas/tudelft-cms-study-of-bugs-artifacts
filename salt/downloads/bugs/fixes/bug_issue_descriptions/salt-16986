Say you have a couple pkg.installed states:

```
pkg1:
  pkg.latest:
    - fromrepo: foo

pkg2:
  pkg.latest:
    - fromrepo: bar
```

... and `state_aggregate: True` is configured.

First problem: when pkg1 is installed, the aggregate will cause pkg2 to also be installed from the same repo as pkg1.

Second problem: when the pkg2 state is later executed, the already-installed pkg2 will only be replaced if the version available in it's repo is newer than the one in pkg1's repo.  This may not be a bug, because pkg.latest should probably not downgrade packages.  In any case, it doesn't undo the incorrect package installed due to the first problem.

Maybe the pkg state's mod_aggregate function should only aggregate installs for packages from the same repo?
