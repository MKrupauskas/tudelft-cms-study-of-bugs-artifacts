ssh_auth.present gives an error when a user's homedir does not exist, even if the keys are not being saved anywhere in the homedir.  The error I get is:
"Failed to add the ssh key. Is the home directory available, and/or does the key file exist?"

In my scenario, ssh keys are in /etc/ssh/keys/$USER.  The home directory is indeed missing, but I don't see why it should be a requirement in this case.

Tested with version 2014.1.4.
