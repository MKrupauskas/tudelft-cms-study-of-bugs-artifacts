### Setup

Given a state SLS node like this where there's no pillar variable with that name:

```
ssl_certificate:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/nginx/ssl/theserver.crt
    - contents_pillar: ZZZZZZZZZ
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Invoking the above will create the managed file with empty contents.  Pillar not-found/typos are silently discarded.
