I ran this command:

```
sudo salt-ssh -i 'remote*' file.copy /home/local/install.sh /home/remote/install.sh
```

and I'm getting this outputted from stderr:

``` python

```

It's complaining that i don't have msgpack or msgpack-python but they're already installed.  This is the output when I run: "salt-ssh --versions-report"

``` yaml

```

I've also tried putting this in a state file and each time I get an error of salt not being able to find the file or directory.

Is this a bug or is there something I am doing wrong?
