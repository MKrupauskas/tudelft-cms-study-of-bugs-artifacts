When I use `mine.get` from the minions it works great
when I try to use it from the master I get nothing back

```
(UTC)[ root@Ran salt-master ~ :) ]$ salt-run mine.get \* test.ping -l debug
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/master
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/master

(UTC)[ root@Ran salt-master ~ :) ]$ salt salt-master mine.get \* test.ping
salt-master:
    ----------
    salt-master:
        True
```

I also tried to create a custom state module that uses `__salt__['mine.get']` and use it with `salt.orch` but I didn't get anything back as well (an empty dict ..) 
some thing like

```
def func(name):
    ret = {'name': name,
           'result': True,
           'changes': {},
           'comment': ''}    
    ret['changes'] = __salt__['mine.get']('*', 'test.ping')
```

Thanks
