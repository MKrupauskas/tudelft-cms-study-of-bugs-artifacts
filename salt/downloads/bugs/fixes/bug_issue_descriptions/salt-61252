**Description**

On a 3003 minion, running the following command fails by returning `False`:
```
salt-call event.send com/acme/foobar with_grains=True
```

While running it without the `with_grains=True` works.
  
After debugging, it turns out that the `__grains__` loader holds the grains data [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/event.py#L79) and when changing thread to actually send the data the `ContextVar` it points to is empty.

This is pretty likely a side effect of PR #58853 and could be easily solved by converting the grains to a `dict` in the load before sending the event.

**Expected behavior**

The command should succeed with or without the `with_grains=True` parameter.
