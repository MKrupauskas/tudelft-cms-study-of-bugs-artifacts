### Description of Issue/Question

If salt-ssh can't find a formula declared in top.sls it doesn't set a non-zero return code.

This matters alot to me, because I use salt-ssh in Jenkins. Jenkins expects non-zero return codes on error to be able to mark the job as failed.
### Command line

salt-ssh -i 'foo*' state.highstate
[ERROR   ] Template was specified incorrectly: False
foo.acme.com:
    - No matching sls found for 'foo' in env 'base'

echo $?
0
### Setup

top.sls:
 'foo*':
    - foo
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Set top.sls to use foo
2. Don't create a foo/init.sls or foo.sls
### Versions Report

2016.3.2
