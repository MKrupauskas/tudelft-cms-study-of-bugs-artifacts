After the update to 0.17.5 from 0.16 sometimes a batch run fails to execute with the following message:

Executing run on ['minion1', 'minion2', 'minion3']

No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.

But the minions are online and pingable with test.ping. All other minions in the batch runs works fine. If I run the same state again they might fail again or not, if I run without batch options everything works fine.
