The `test=True` mode for a `file.managed` state is not working correctly for symlinks.
Instead of checking the actual target of the symlink, it checks the symlink's permissions itself when changing `mode` for the file. Normal mode is working correctly. Confirmed in Salt 2014.7.0 and 2014.7.1.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Having a normal file `/tmp/test.txt` with permissions 0600 already available.
2. A symlink `/tmp/test.sym` linking to `/tmp/test.txt` must be present as well.
3. A state which specifies the mode through the symlink:

```
/tmp/test.sym:
  file.managed:
    - contents: test
    - mode: 600 
```

**Test run:**

```
root@saltTest:/tmp# salt-call state.sls test test=True
local:
----------
          ID: /tmp/test.sym
    Function: file.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: The following values are set to be changed:
