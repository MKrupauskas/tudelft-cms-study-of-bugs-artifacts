### Description of Issue

GH-39891 creates a "legacy style XOR new style" situation where all old style states in the wild will no longer work,  This means that there is a lot of community content that will simply fail to work once sodium is shipped. 

This creates unnecessary work for anyone with states that work (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).  It also means that anyone that's already chosen to use "new style" syntax can't use old style states without modifying them.

This is just a barrier to entry/usage of the system and I can foresee a situation where some people's production workloads will just stop working because of this when folks upgrade to sodium.

re: the warning that this is happening in Sodium - I was using the product for five months before I'd hit this issue - and if I'd not decided to "opt in" to the new syntax, I wouldn't have seen the issue until I'd upgraded to sodium.  And it fails in a non-obvious way.

The module.run should be changed such that it can parse both the old and new style states.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run a new-style on a default pre-sodium system or run a legacy style state on a minion with the module.run set to superceded.
