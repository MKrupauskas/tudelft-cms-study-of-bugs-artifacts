Hi. basepi  (Colton Myers) suggested that I should create an issue ("We do not like tracebacks.")

I have known about salt for less than 24 hours. I'm following the walkthrough at http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html. I have the master set up on a Ubuntu 12.04 server (Linode) and the minion is a Virtual Box Kubuntu 12.04. Salt was installed from the Ubuntu repos on both machines, as per the walkthrough instructions.

Here's my report:

```
root@myserver:/etc/salt# salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
minion.example.com
tester-VirtualBox
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
```

minion.example.com is publicly accessible (it's another Linode). tester-VirtualBox is the Kubuntu 12.04 minion I mentioned.

So far, so good. But the next three examples from the walkthrough all failed. I appreciate any tips. Here are the details.
