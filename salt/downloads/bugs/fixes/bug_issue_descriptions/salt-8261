I just ran into a problem where I had a state like this:

```
lxc-net:
  service.dead:
    - enable: false
```

Which I changed to:

```
lxc-net:
  service.running:
    - enable: true
```

The above did not enable the service because `lxc-net.override` was not cleaned up.  I would expect `- enable: true` to remove the `lxc-net.override` file that was written by `- enable: false`.

In order to enable the service I also had to add the following, which should not be necessary:

```
/etc/init/lxc-net.override:
  file:
    - absent
```
