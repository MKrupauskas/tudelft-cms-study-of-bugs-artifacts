### Description of Issue/Question

Seems to balk on the hg `--ssh` option which is produced via the state's `-identity` option, despite the fact that manually running the entire command as shown in the debug output succeeds.

### Versions Report

Running masterless, following the masterless quickstart, `salt --versions-report` fails because no salt. But `salt-call` version is `2016.3.3`:

```
root@precise64:/srv# salt --versions-report
...
salt: command not found

root@precise64:/srv# salt-call --version
salt-call 2016.3.3 (Boron)
```
