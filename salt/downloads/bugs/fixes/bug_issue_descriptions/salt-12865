Given the following:

```
  mount.unmounted:
      - name: /mnt/foobar
      - persist: True
```

On the first run, it will unmount /mnt/foobar and remove it from /etc/fstab. On subsequent runs, the state will fail with message "Target was already unmounted. Unfortunately the mount could not be purged".

If there is nothing to purge from /etc/fstab, why is that a failure condition? It just means that the state is unchanged.
