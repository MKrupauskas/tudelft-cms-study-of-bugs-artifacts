Sorry if this is the wrong place to put this - I dont have a solution at the moment so hoping for some help!

```

We're trying to use salt-ssh from centos6.6 to ubuntu 14.04 minions, it seems to get a lot of the way, but then fail with this:

``` python
salt-ssh -i cserver4 test.ping
cserver4:
    ----------
    retcode:
        1
    stderr:
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt-call", line 4, in <module>
            salt_call()
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/scripts.py", line 221, in salt_call
            import salt.cli.call
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/cli/call.py", line 6, in <module>
            from salt.utils import parsers
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/utils/parsers.py", line 28, in <module>
            import salt.config as config
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/config.py", line 28, in <module>
            import salt.utils.network
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/utils/network.py", line 26, in <module>
            from salt._compat import subprocess
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/salt/_compat.py", line 22, in <module>
            import xml.etree.cElementTree as ElementTree
          File "/tmp/.root_62a99a__salt/xml/etree/cElementTree.py", line 3, in <module>
            from _elementtree import *
          File "<string>", line 147, in <module>
        AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'fromstringlist'
    stdout:
```

If I install salt-ssh on another ubuntu14.04 box (python2.7) and retry, it works just fine:

```
salt-ssh cserver4 test.ping
cserver4:
    True
```

Any ideas? I can test / run anything that will be helpful
