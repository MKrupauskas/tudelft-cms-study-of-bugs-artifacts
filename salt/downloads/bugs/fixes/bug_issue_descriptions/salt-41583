### Description of Issue/Question

mount.swap on a on-disk swap file will always report Result: None even when the swap file is mounted, w/ persist: True.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
# Create swapfile
```
/swapfile:
  cmd.run:
    - name: |
        [ -f /swapfile ] || /usr/bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096
        /usr/bin/chmod 0600 /swapfile
        /usr/sbin/mkswap /swapfile
        /usr/sbin/swapon -a
    - unless: /usr/bin/file /swapfile 2>&1 | /usr/bin/grep -q "Linux/i386 swap"
  mount.swap:
    - persist: true
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Run above state, the first time it'll create a 4 GB on-disk swap file at /swapfile, add to /etc/fstab, and swapon it.  Subsequent runs show no issue with this state.  Running w/ test=True however, you'll get this:
```
local:
----------
          ID: /swapfile
    Function: mount.swap
      Result: None
     Comment: Swap /swapfile is set to be added to the fstab and to be activated
