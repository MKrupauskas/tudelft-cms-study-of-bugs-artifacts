Similar to the following issues #29567 and #24243

In 2015.8.4 the same behavior as reported in the above issues is the same:

```
master:
  - 192.168.50.10
  - 192.168.50.11
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 15
```
1. start both masters and the minion
2. stop the first master in the list (192.168.50.10)
3. wait for minion to failover to second master (this takes probably about 5-10 minutes)
4. cannot run commands from the second master(failover master)

The only new behavior i am reporting is during step 3 when the minion fails  over to the second master there is now a stack trace error in 2015.8.4 as follows:
