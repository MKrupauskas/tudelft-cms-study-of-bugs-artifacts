I've traversed the git history of the develop branch and ever since the commit 4dcfc6119a5a9888c054ec4d6b66284506a8843a , any "salt-run jobs.active" results in the error message:

[ERROR   ] Missing required funcs for zk_concurrency

Based on the fact that 4dcfc6119a5a9888c054ec4d6b66284506a8843a introduced the check that is reporting this message, I'm not sure what it is bringing to the table. The check is found here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/4dcfc6119a5a9888c054ec4d6b66284506a8843a/salt/states/zk_concurrency.py#L52-53

To reproduce:

Check out any version of salt that includes commit 4dcfc6119a5a9888c054ec4d6b66284506a8843a and execute "salt-run jobs.active", with a brand new salt-master running.
