When I made one of my ext_pillar queries a stored procedure, I started getting the error below on the Salt master.  Modifying the for loop of ext_pillar() in mysql.py to get a new cursor at the beginning of every iteration and close that cursor at the end of every iteration seems to resolve the issue.  As a work around I made the stored procedure the last query for the external pillar, and that eliminated the error messages.

I'm using version 2014.7.0.  It looks like the cursor handling is the same in the 2015.5 branch.

```
