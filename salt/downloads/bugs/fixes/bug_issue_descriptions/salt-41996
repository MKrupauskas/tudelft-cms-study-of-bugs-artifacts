### Description of Issue/Question
I am running Docker on my local machine. I am in the 'docker' group and can run the standard Docker 'hello world' from the command line. I am attempting to use dockerng to build/run an image given a Dockerfile sitting in a local directory. The Dockerfile in question is vanilla and runs just fine from the Docker CLI. I am not root, so I'm using `salt-call --local state.sls <mystate> localconfig=<myconfig>`. This fails with:

```
local:
----------
          ID: myuser/myimage:mytag
    Function: dockerng.image_present
      Result: False
     Comment: Encountered error building /home/bar/Dev/foo/build/foo.services.users as myuser/myimage:mytag: the JSON object must be str, not 'bytes'

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

* Using a Python 3.5 virtualenv
* `salt` and `docker-py` installed from `pip`.
* `docker.io` installed from `apt-get` on vanilla Ubuntu.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

```bash
/home/bar/Dev/foo/env/4/bin/salt-call --local \
   -l all \
   state.sls foo-docker \
   localconfig=/tmp/tmpm7k1ydjp \
   pillar="{'dockerfile_dir': '/home/bar/Dev/foo/build/foo.services.users'}"
```
