Hello all,

I'm trying to get the default routes/netmask of a machine using network.default_route and network.routes calls through salt-ssh. However both fail on version 2015.2.0rc1:

```
----------
retcode:
    1
stderr:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt-call", line 4, in <module>
        salt_call()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/scripts.py", line 220, in salt_call
        client.run()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/cli/call.py", line 69, in run
        caller.run()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/cli/caller.py", line 236, in run
        ret = self.call()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/cli/caller.py", line 138, in call
        ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/modules/network.py", line 1087, in default_route
        _routes = routes()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/modules/network.py", line 1058, in routes
        routes_ = _netstat_route_linux()
      File "/tmp/.root_8ed75c__salt/salt/modules/network.py", line 309, in _netstat_route_linux
        'destination': comps[0],
    IndexError: list index out of range
stdout:
```

I tried to debug what's happening by running the command on the minnion. Please see the output here:

I think something dodgy happens when commands with pipes and other symbols run through cmd.run: netstat -A inet -rn | tail -n+3

Any input/feedback would be valuable.
Thanks
