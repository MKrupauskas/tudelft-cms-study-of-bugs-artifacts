When a registry is defined in pillar:

```
docker-registries:
  https://xxx.xxx.com/v2/:
  ...
  ...
```

and for some reason it's unaccessible, and you try to pull image from docker.io:

```
some_image:
  dockerng.image_present:
    - name: docker.io/image:tag
```

you get error, 'cause salt tries to login to the 'bad' registry:

```
