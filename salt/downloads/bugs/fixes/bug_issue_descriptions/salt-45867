### Description of Issue/Question
Icinga2 changed the paths for certificates starting in version 2.8.  The paths are hardcoded in the Icinga2 module, and refer to the paths for versions 2.7 and prior.

### Suggestion to Fix
We could update the module and hardcode the new paths.  However, this could break installs for old versions.  In a perfect world, we'd be able to determine the paths automatically based on the version number.

Another option is to give the user control of the path (either create a different version of the module for the new versions, create a flag for the new paths, or an option to directly select the path).  I'm not a fan of this option because it requires the user to micromanage the command/state as clients are upgraded (and is therefore no longer portable).  This is especially problematic in a mixed environment.

I'm pretty comfortable doing the fixing, but I'm not sure what the best direction is.  If we do want to autodetect the version, a canonical example of a different module that does it would be helpful for best practices.

### Versions Report
This is an issue for the current version, and appears to still be an issue in Oxygen.  As of the latest Oxygen commit in Github, the old paths were still hardcoded.
