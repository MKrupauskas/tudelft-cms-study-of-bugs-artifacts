Hi!

When I do a salt-call grains.items call on a machine with an integrated Intel graphics driver, I get:

```
gpus:
 ----------
 - model:
 82Q35 Express Integrated Graphics Controller
 - vendor:
 ati
```

A quick lspci shows:

```
# lspci|grep -i vga
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82Q35 Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
```

Clearly this is intel and not ati. Let me know if you need anything else for this bug.

Currently using salt-minion version 0.14.0.
