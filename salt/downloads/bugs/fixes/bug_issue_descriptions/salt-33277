### Description of Issue/Question

On startup of a windows minion if the master is not available the windows minion will die and not attempt to re-authenticate with the master.
### Setup

A windows minion who's key as previously been accepted by the master. This occurs in both single and multi-master mode.

/etc/salt/minion

`master: 192.168.50.10`

or 

```
master:
  - 192.168.50.10
  - 192.168.50.11
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Setup a windows minion and point to master
2. Accept the key on the master
3. Stop the master and the minion
4. Start the minion and see the minion attempt to communicate with the down master.
5. the minion will then die after its attempted to communicate with the down master. 

Here is the debug log output:
