Hi,

Bit of a strange one here and I've not been able to get to the bottom of it - or figured out how to reliably replicate it.

Salt-SSH occasionally gets itself into a state where it will randomly output the password used for SSHing to the server into the JSON output it's trying to render, causing a render failure. When it's doing this it will always output the password at the end of the JSON output, but I've also found that it appears random _in_ the output. For example:

```
[ERROR   ] JSON Render failed for: {
    "local": {
        "fun_args": [
            "/var/lib/acme/salt//salt_state.tgz", 
            "test=None", 
            "pkg_sum=953bb413acfa01c1e9a65c7e5258f449", 
            "hash_type=md5"
        ], 
        "jid": "20151204095708560039", 
        "return": {
   ... snip ...
            "file_|-/var/www/vhosts_|-/var/www/vhosts_|-directory": {
                "comment": "Directory /var/www/vhosts is in the correct state", THEPASSWORD

                "name": "/var/www/vhosts", 
                "start_time": "09:57:34.040038", 
                "result": true, 
                "duration": 0.823, 
                "__run_num__": 52, 
                "changes": {}
            }, 
    ... snip ...
        }, 
        "retcode": 0, 
        "fun": "state.pkg", 
        "id": "SID1000000", 
        "out": "highstate"
    }
}
THEPASSWORD
```

I've tried removing the thin dir on the remote, and also disabling keeping the thin dir just in case, but it still happens. I'm not sure what triggers it but I'm unable to make it stop doing this! There's nothing else that stands out in the debug output that I believe it related to this.
