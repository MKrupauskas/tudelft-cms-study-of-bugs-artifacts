I'm hoping I'm just crazy and did something wrong. But this following state errors on the side that I'm not providing a password. However, I'm clearing passing a password. If the password was incorrect, it would show that I'm supplying a password.

Using this state

```
add mysql user:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: someuser
    - host: localhost
    - password: somepass
    - connection_user: root
    - connection_pass: abc123
    - connection_host: localhost
    - connection_charset: utf8
```

returns

```
          ID: add mysql user
    Function: mysql_grants.present
      Result: False
     Comment: MySQL Error 1045: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
```
