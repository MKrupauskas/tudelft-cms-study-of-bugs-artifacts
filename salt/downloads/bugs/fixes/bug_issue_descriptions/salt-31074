Hi,

Looking for some guidance regarding the usage of the "sudo_user" in the roster file option "minion_opts".
Seems like the commands are not executed as the "sudo_user" but as the connecting user.

Salt version: 2015.8

Here is my roster file:

```
minionid:
  host: myhost
  user: sshuser
  priv: /secret/path/to/key/sshuser_priv
  minion_opts:
    sudo_user: appuser
```

I can confirm that the sudo is correct configured on "myhost" since I can run;

`salt-ssh myhost cmd.run 'sudo -u appuser touch /tmp/test1'`

This gives me the correct permissions as appuser, however if I run;

`salt-ssh my host cmd.run 'touch /tmp/test2'`

I get the permission of the "sshuser" while I was expecting that the permission of the sudo_user.
Please, advice if my expectation is either incorrect or if my setup is not correct.

Kind regards,
