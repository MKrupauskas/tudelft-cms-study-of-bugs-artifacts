The event module creates a short lived MinionEvent object:
[salt/modules/event.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/fa70ff20f9aa23b8cceb1eccc34922b0d5c0c8d4/salt/modules/event.py#L45)

SaltEvent.**del** calls SaltEvent.destroy which sets the socket linger to 1ms and closes the socket:
[salt/utils/event.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/babaef6bd468af2fc876a092194b22bca885f841/salt/utils/event.py#L279)

Minion events are dropped very often as a result - especially when using tcp for IPC on windows.
