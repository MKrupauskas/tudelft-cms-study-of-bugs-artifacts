### Description of Issue/Question

Beacons implement a validate function, which makes sure the config is correct. The execution module for beacons do make sure the validate function is called on add:

```
    # Attempt to validate
    if hasattr(beacon_module, 'validate'):
        _beacon_data = beacon_data
        if 'enabled' in _beacon_data:
            del _beacon_data['enabled'] 
        valid, vcomment = beacon_module.validate(_beacon_data)
    else:
        log.info('Beacon {0} does not have a validate'
                 ' function,  skipping validation.'.format(name))
        valid = True   
```

However, on minion startup, the validate method is not called. Some beacons (like adb.py) call the validate method from the main beacon method, some implement validate but the function is not called.

Sounds to me like validate should always be called, the same way the beacons.add execution module works. At the very least the strategy should be consistent (all beacons call validate from the main beacon method or none do and validate is called during beacon load).
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)    
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Add print statement to validate beacon function (any beacon that doesn't call validate from the main beacon function). The print won't be hit.
### Versions Report

Tested on develop, but reproduce on 2015.8.x and 2015.5.x
