### Description of Issue/Question
On 2017.7.6 when using CTRL-C to exit running command it gives this traceback:
```
[root@frode1 ~]# salt '*' test.sleep 30
^C[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

```

It should return this info ( as it does on 2017.7.5):
```
[root@frode1 ~]# salt '*' test.sleep 30
^C
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
