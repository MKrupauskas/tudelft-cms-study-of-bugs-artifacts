```
nodename:
   pip.installed:
      - requirements: /path/to/requirements.txt
```

this, besides installing packages from requirements.txt would also install nodename. A work around that works is:

```
nodename:
   pip.installed:
      - name: ''
      - requirements: /path/to/requirements.txt
```

but would be nice to not install nodename if requirements is present.
