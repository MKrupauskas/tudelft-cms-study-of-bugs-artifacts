### Description of Issue/Question

When running `salt '*' user.chgroups dude 'groupy,groupz'` I get return True, even though it exists with return code 11 because the group does not exist. I am expecting this to return false.
### Setup
1. windows salt-minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. 

```
  ch3ll@localhost  ~  sudo salt 'win2*' user.chgroups dude 'groupy,groupz'
win2012:
    True
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
  ch3ll@localhost  ~  echo $?
11
```

As shown below salt-call provides more information and tells us this is because groupy does not exist:

```
 ch3ll@localhost  ~  sudo salt 'win2*' cmd.run "C:\salt\salt-call.bat --local user.chgroups dude 'groupy,groupz'" 
win2012:
    [INFO    ] Executing command 'net localgroup "groupz" dude /add' in directory 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile'
    [ERROR   ] Command 'net localgroup "groupz" dude /add' failed with return code: 2
    [ERROR   ] stderr: System error 1376 has occurred.



    The specified local group does not exist.
    [ERROR   ] retcode: 2
    local:
        True
```

I would expect to see a False above instead of True since their is a fail in the command.
