When trying to create a new instance on the develop branch for rackspace using the openstack driver, I am getting the following error:

```
salt-cloud -p rackspace-test nt-testing-cloud
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
Error: There was a profile error: Cannot deploy salt in a VM if the 'ssh_keyfile' setting is not set and there is no password set for the vm. Check your provider for the 'change_password' option.
```

This appears to be a regression, as I was able to create an instance using the same profile and provider files on 2014.1.4.
