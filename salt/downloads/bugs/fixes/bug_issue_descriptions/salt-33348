### Description of Issue/Question

Since we have `--retcode-passthrough` argument we should get real status code from salt. But it doesn't work with `state.sls_id`.
### Setup

Example of failure state:

```
run_buzzy_command:
  cmd.not_existed_command:
    - name: test
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

``` bash
$ salt-call --retcode-passthrough state.sls_id run_buzzy_command test; echo $?

[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** done ** u'test.sls'
[INFO    ] Running state [test] at time 23:01:23.936309
[ERROR   ] State 'cmd.not_existed_command' was not found in SLS 'test'
Reason: 'cmd.not_existed_command' is not available.
