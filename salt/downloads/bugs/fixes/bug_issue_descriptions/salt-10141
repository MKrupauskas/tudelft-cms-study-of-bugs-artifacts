In git.latest state, salt try to run git fetch (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/git.py#L222) before trying to checkout to rev (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/git.py#L227).

The problem is when we use tags which are not retrieved via git fetch (a multi head on master branch). Salt should run git fetch with "--tags" option in order to retrieve them.

The usecase is not common and we maybe need to work on our release workflow but it's an easy fix, so if it's a good idea, I will add a pull-request.
