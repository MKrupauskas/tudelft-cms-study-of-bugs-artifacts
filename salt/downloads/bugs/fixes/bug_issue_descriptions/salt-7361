I have a daemontools service that I am managing using salt. the service state does not recognize the service, even though the daemontools module does.

Starting the service:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'svc -u /service/trafficsac' in directory '/root'
local:
    True
```

Stopping the service:

```
[root@saltqa /]# salt-call daemontools.stop trafficsac
[INFO    ] Executing command 'svc -d /service/trafficsac' in directory '/root'
local:
    True
```

Managing the service with the service state:

```
[root@saltqa /]# salt-call state.sls trafficserver.collector
...
----------
    State: - service
    Name:      trafficsac
    Function:  running
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The named service trafficsac is not available
        Changes: 
...
```

The relevant stanza in the SLS file is:

```
trafficsac:
  service.running:
    - provider: daemontools
```

From the documentation and issue #4397, my understanding is that this syntax should work.

I'm running Salt 0.16.4 from EPEL:

```
[root@saltqa /]# salt --versions
           Salt: 0.16.4
