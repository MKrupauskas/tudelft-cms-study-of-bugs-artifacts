### Description of Issue/Question
I'm considering the case where salt-api is running on a different server than a deployed app that makes use of the API (likely a common use case, I imagine?) 

Currently, since the token does not specify a domain, the deployed app can not consume the cookie contained in the Set-Cookie header of the response. 

Is it feasible for the API to use the hostname of the machine it's running on and include this as the domain when creating/returning the cookie? 

As I understand it, this would allow an app hosted at foo.bar.com to query the API hosted at baz.bar.com.

Thanks much
