From the libcloud 0.14 upgrade docs

> To make drivers with multiple regions easier to use, one of the big changes in this version is move away from the old “one class per region” model to a new single class plus region argument model.

salt-cloud doesn't handle this properly.  It doesn't even attempt to provide compute_region has it parses it from the config to the compute Provider drivers.  For example using the Rackspace driver it attempts to concatenate RACKSPACE_NOVA_ and the region name to get the suitable driver.

I was able to hack the Rackspace driver to work by passing the region= parameter into the driver initialization (and getting compute_region from the config as lower() rather than upper())  The other compute providers will most likely require similar hacking.
