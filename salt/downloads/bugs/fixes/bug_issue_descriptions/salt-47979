### Description of Issue/Question
The Zookeeper execution module raises a NoNodeError when doing a get for a node that doesn't exist. This causes states which use this module in Jinja to fail. I think it would be better to catch this exception and return something reasonable (`None` maybe). 

I wrote a custom SDB module on top of the Zookeeper execution module, so one solution for me is to catch it in the SDB module, but I think it might be better to catch it within the execution module.

### Setup
Install Zookeeper

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
[root@minion salt]# salt-call zookeeper.get hello
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
NoNodeError:
