It seems like the Developers of Manjaro changed the OS name to "ManjaroLinux" which now is the value of the os grain. So it has to be changed in Salt from "Manjaro" to "ManjaroLinux" to detect the correct package manager, etc. 
So far in the core.py file there is only "Manjaro" listed and therefore Salt does not detect the correct package manager.
