It appears because the configs are loading in a single operation, config options that rely on other configs options default to the ones built into the code.  In this case it's the CACHE_DIR in syspaths.py.  This seems to only apply to the master, as it has 2 config options that build on top of CACHE_DIR in config.py:

```
'extension_modules': os.path.join(salt.syspaths.CACHE_DIR, 'extmods'),
'sqlite_queue_dir': os.path.join(salt.syspaths.CACHE_DIR, 'master', 'queues'),
```

I think we need to force options that are the base elsewhere to be loaded first to ensure they are available.  This is obviously a small issue as you can simply hardcode the 2 settings above in your conf, but it's a bit confusing.

In my case we changed our cachedir, but noticed only a queues directory kept getting creating in /var/cache/salt/master on Linux.
