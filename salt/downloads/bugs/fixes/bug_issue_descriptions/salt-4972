    Name:      mc
    Function:  purged
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Package mc is not installed
        Changes:
```

yes, it's not installed... but it's not purged!

```
dpkg --status mc |grep ^Status
Status: deinstall ok config-files
```

still there, it need `dpkg --purge mc` to get rid of it.
