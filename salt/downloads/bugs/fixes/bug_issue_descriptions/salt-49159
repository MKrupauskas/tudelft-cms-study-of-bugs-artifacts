### Description of Issue/Question

In the documentation of the [latest version(2018.3.2)](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#ipv6), and the [develop version](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/ref/configuration/minion.html#ipv6), the default value of minion's `ipv6` option is documented as `None`.

However, in the code of [2018.3.2](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2018.3.2/salt/config/__init__.py#L1352) and the [develop branch](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/config/__init__.py#L1377), the default value is coded as `False`.

This makes IPv6-only minion still use master's IPv4 address when using a domain name. To work around this issue currently, set an empty `ipv6` option in `/etc/salt/minion`:

```yaml
ipv6:
```  

This sets `opts['ipv6']` in the code to `None`, and now the minion respects the preference of the OS.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Disable IPv4 on the minion
2. Do not set `ipv6` in the minion config
3. Use domain name for master, and make sure it has AAAA record
4. run `salt-minion -l debug`. The minion will try to connect to the master using IPv4 address, over and over again.
