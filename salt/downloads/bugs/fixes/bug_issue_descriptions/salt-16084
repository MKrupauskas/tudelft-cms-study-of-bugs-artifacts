I have the following state

```
# Was /dev/md0
root-partition:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: /
    - device: UUID=139351d3-d69b-42b6-a21e-0edbca4b5bf6
    - fstype: ext4
    - mkmnt: True
    - opts: relatime,errors=remount-ro
    - persist: True
    - dump: 0
    - pass_nume: 1
```

The partition is already mounted with the right UUID

```
$ mount
/dev/md0 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro)

$ ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid/139351d3-d69b-42b6-a21e-0edbca4b5bf6 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Sep 21 17:29 /dev/disk/by-uuid/139351d3-d69b-42b6-a21e-0edbca4b5bf6 -> ../../md0
```

When I run the state using salt I get this errro

```
          ID: root-partition
    Function: mount.mounted
        Name: /
      Result: None
     Comment: Unable to unmount

```

I am using

```
$ salt-master --version

I guess the problem is that `/dev/disk/by-uuid/139351d3-d69b-42b6-a21e-0edbca4b5bf6, /dev/md0` is not recognized as equivalent to UUID

I get a similar error for swap

```
          ID: swap-partitions
    Function: mount.swap
        Name: UUID=399d7eca-4f8e-4e76-8aad-022f0d4b5e15
      Result: False
     Comment: Swap UUID=399d7eca-4f8e-4e76-8aad-022f0d4b5e15 failed to activate. Updated the entry in the fstab.

Thanks!
