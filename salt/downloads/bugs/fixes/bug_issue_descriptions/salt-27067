If an entry doesn't exist at all, it is added fine:

```
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
# demo sources.list file
$ sudo salt-call state.high "{'partner': {'pkgrepo': ['managed', {'name': 'deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ trusty partner'}, {'enabled': True}, {'file': '/etc/apt/sources.list'}]}}"

```

But if an entry already exists and is commented out, the state does nothing:

```
$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list
# demo sources.list file
# deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu trusty partner
$ sudo salt-call state.high "{'partner': {'pkgrepo': ['managed', {'name': 'deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/ trusty partner'}, {'enabled': True}, {'file': '/etc/apt/sources.list'}]}}"
