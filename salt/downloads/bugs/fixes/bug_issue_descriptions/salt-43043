### Description of Issue/Question
Im having problems with two docker functions. save and load. 
Here is an example:
`salt 'dev-machine' docker.save webservice:0.0.4 /tmp/webservice_img.tar overwrite=True push=True`
then I load the image in another machine
`salt 'stg-machine' docker.load salt://webservice_img.tar image=webservice:0.0.4`
It generates this Warning
More than one top-level image layer was loaded 
When I check on the stg-machine docker images the image is not loaded. My assumption is the docker.load would tag the image with the image name passed

after doing a docker save manually from the dev-minion and copy the image to the stg-minion
`docker save -o /tmp/webservice_img.tar webservice:0.0.4`
and then use the normal docker.load function everything works okay and image is loaded successfully 
`salt 'stg-machine' docker.load /tmp/webservice_img.tar image=webservice:0.0.4`

After inspecting the code I believe the issue is that docker save uses the image id to call `docker save`. I tested the following on my environment and seems to have worked for me, I made the following change 
`cmd = ['docker', 'save', '-o', saved_path, inspect_image(name)['Id']]`
to 
```
image_name = name if name in inspect_image(name)['RepoTags'] else inspect_image(name)['Id']
cmd = ['docker', 'save', '-o', saved_path, image_name]
```
If the user passes an image Tag then use the image:tag passed if not use the image id. I can create  a PR if thats okay. Thanks!
