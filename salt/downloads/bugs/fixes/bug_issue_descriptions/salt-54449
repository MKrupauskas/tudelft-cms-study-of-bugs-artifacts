### Description of Issue
I'm trying to use `docker_image.present` but salt fails to detect the module on first `state.apply` because the required python modules are installed in that run. On second `state.apply` the module is detected and used. This is even the case with `reload_modules: true` set.

On the first run I see:
```

    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: The following packages were installed/updated: python3-docker

              Reason: 'docker_image' __virtual__ returned False: 'docker.version' is not available.

```

On the minion itself the `salt-minion` logs have this error:
```
salt-minion[138912]: [ERROR   ] State 'docker_image.present' was not found in SLS 'kube-minion'
salt-minion[138912]: Reason: 'docker_image' __virtual__ returned False: 'docker.version' is not available.
```

However, it works on second run:
```

```
### Setup
I have two state files. docker.sls:
```
Docker:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
        - docker-ce: 18.06.1~ce~3-0~debian
        - python3-docker
    - install_recommends: False
    - reload_modules: true
```

and kube.sls:
```
include:
  - docker

Kubernetes Dependency Image k8s.gcr.io/pause:
  docker_image.present:
    - name: k8s.gcr.io/pause
    - tag: 3.1
    - reload_modules: True
    - require:
      - pkg: Docker
      - service: Docker
      - pkg: Kubernetes Dependencies
```

This may be related to #54332 but in that case `pip` is the installation method and the error message is different. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1) Run `salt <minion> state.apply`
2) Get Failure
3) Run `salt <minion> state.apply`
Success!
