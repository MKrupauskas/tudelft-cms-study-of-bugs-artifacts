on develop HEAD when you use 

```
python setup.py install --root=/tmp/
cat /tmp/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/_syspaths.py
```

you will see

```
ROOT_DIR = '/home/user/salt/root'
```

instead of 

```
ROOT_DIR = '/tmp/'
```

you need to run it like this 

```
python setup.py install --root=/tmp --salt-root-dir=/tmp
```

then you get 

```
ROOT_DIR = '/tmp'
```

but then also then next one is wrong

```
CONFIG_DIR = '/home/user/salt/root/etc/salt'
```
