### Description of Issue/Question

`salt-call state.apply` on the minion works fine.
However when sending commands from the master to the minion they time out.

`salt -l debug apollo test.ping` on the master times out.

Job 20161008170552660289 seems to be received on the minion but nothing seems to happen.
The salt call on the master tiems out.
### Setup

Any salt-master - salt-minion setup, even stuff like test.ping fails.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. upgrade salt-master to 2016.11.0rc1
2. upgrade first salt-minion to 2016.11.0rc1
3. send a test.ping from the master to the upgraded minion
