**Description**
I've just commissioned a new SuSE Manager server based on 15SP1 and I'm just moving over my minions from my previous salt-master server. Unfortunately after adding the minion I stumble upon this issue. 

**[ERROR   ] Got a bad pillar from master, type str, expecting dict: 
[ERROR   ] Error while bringing up minion for multi-master. Is master at responding?**

**Setup**
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (be sure to remove sensitive info).

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
I've deleted the minion several times by removing the package completely from the minion and deleted /etc/salt in addition to /var/cache/salt

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
