I am running on Amazon Linux.

PIllar data delivered by git that previously worked with 2014.7.1 no longer work in 2014.7.5.

If I load the same files from the git repo into a local dir and add a pillar_roots config, they work just fine. I have boiled it down the the following:

Filesystem case:
1. create dir /tmp/blah
2. add the following to /etc/salt/master

```
pillars_roots:
  base:
    - /tmp/blah
```
1. add the following to /tmp/blah/top.sls

```
base:
  '*':
    - base
```
1. add the following to /tmp/blah/base.sls

```
wt: test
```

When I run with this pillar data, I get what I expect, a pillar data for all hosts that includes "wt"->"test".

When I change to put this pillar data in a git repo and load it with the git_pillar ext_pillar, it does not work. Here are the steps:
1. create a repo at somewhere
2. Add it to the config in /etc/salt/master:

```
ext_pillar:
  - git: master git+ssh://<server>/<git_repo_path>.git
```
1. Add the top.sls and base.sls files mentioned above to the master branch on the repo.
2. Start the salt-master.
3. Watch the logs mention that the git repos are being updated.
4. Check the /var/cache/master/gitfs_pillar directory and see that the git repo master branch has indeed been updated
5. Try to refresh the pillars on a minion.
6. Get no results while slamming your head into the desk over and over.

Please help me.
