### Description of Issue/Question

At the head of 2015.8 When a minion cannot reach a master that is down in a multi-master configuration setup there is an error in the logs and the minions shows that it is restarting.
### Setup

/etc/salt/minion:

```
master:
  - 192.168.50.11
  - 192.168.50.12
master_type: failover
master_shuffle: False
master_alive_interval: 30
retry_dns: 0
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Make sure the minion has been accepted on both masters and you can communicate
2. Stop Both Masters and Minion
3. Start minion and watch it attempt to authenticate between both masters. When it cannot authenticate with both masters it then restarts the salt-minion and I get an error:

```

The minion does restart and whne the master comes back online the minion is able to connect to the master just fine, the issue is the error and the minion restarting.

Also to note I did edit `scripts.py` to have exc_info=True instead of false so I could get the stack trace error:

`log.error('Minion failed to start: {0}'.format(exc.message), exc_info=True)`
