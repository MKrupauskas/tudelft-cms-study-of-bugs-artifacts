I currently have a cron script to automatically update salt-minion on all of my servers

```
0 */12 * * * apt-get -y install salt-minion
```

After it installed an update on the PPA 9 days ago, states start failing with

```
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 11360 and was started at 2015, Mar 27 15:34:58.333159 with jid 20150327153458333159
```

and the following errors appear on the minion logs

```

```

Additional signs include:

In the salt-master log:

```
An extra return was detected from minion XXXX, please verify the minion, this could be a replay attack
```

Minions also cannot run commands using cmd.run, and will usually result in something like below

```
xxxx:
    /bin/sh: 1: reboot: not found
```

Tried the following:
1. Stopping Minion, deleting the cache and starting minion
2. Re-adding the keys using salt-minion
3. Stopping Minion and killing all other salt-minion processes (After stopping, a few remained and failed to stop each time)

Ultimately, the only thing that worked was restarting the entire server (salt-minion)
