When trying to use PAM with eauth on os x  a failed authenticaton response is delayed by about 60 seconds when the user does not have admin priviledges

Example:
The last command with take 0ver 60 seconds to complete

> > > import salt.auth
> > > import salt.config
> > > opts = salt.config.client_config('/etc/salt/master')
> > > auth = salt.auth.LoadAuth(opts)
> > > auth.mk_token(dict(username='saltuser', password='badpass', eauth='pam'))
> > > {}

If the user has admin priviledges then the last command returns in under 1 second

THis same problem occurs with salt-api on OS X.
Suspect that it is a permissions problem in how the salt modules are run from salt-api or loaded by salt on os x.

Note that if the credentials are valid a successful eauth returns immediately for any user. It is only failed credentials that have the problem. So it has nothing to do with the user being authenticated but with the user running python eg salt

Since the failed response always eventually returns it is not a simple permissions problem but some sort of threading or race condition induced by the permissions problem.
