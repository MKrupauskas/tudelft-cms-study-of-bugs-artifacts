While winrm support is built into 2015.8 it seems it can sometimes be bypassed in the specific provider itself. This is what is observed provisioning Windows on EC2 almost certainly due to the proprietary way Windows passwords are generated by AWS.

The bug is here https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py#L2160 as part of 'wait_for_instance'. 

There is no check for use_winrm option and the default behavior to use winexe is executed. This subsequently fails on systems with winexe unavailable leading to a deployment failure.
