Not sure if a duplicate of 6097 or it is yum specific (or has something to do with the fact I'm trying to install a 32bit package on a 64bit machine):

    State: - pkg
    Name:      jre.i586
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: jre.i586.
        Changes:   jre: { new : 1.7.0_25-1.amzn1
old :
}
```

The package actually installs fine, but the state returns False. If this is already fixed please point me to the right commit so I can add a patch to my .spec.

Thanks.
