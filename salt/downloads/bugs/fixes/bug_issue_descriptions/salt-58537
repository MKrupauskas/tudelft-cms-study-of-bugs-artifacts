**Description**
Currently we have a [test](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/e941aa8fd207bb2addd1caa5ffe26cd9ae966095/tests/pytests/integration/modules/test_sysmod.py#L10-L93), migrated from [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v3001.1/tests/integration/modules/test_sysmod.py), that checks the salt loader modules for proper CLI examples and missing docstrings.

This is the **wrong** way to do it since some modules, possibly due to missing libraries or the wrong platform, tell the loader in `__virtual__` to not load the module, an example [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v3001.1/salt/modules/win_disk.py#L34-L40).
Thus, only a subset of modules is actually tested.

We need to make the same kind of checks, but on all modules, even modules which are not supposed to load on the platform checking them.
