### Description of Issue/Question
When using the "pkgs" option of the solarisips module, this exception is thrown:
```
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'items'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/sbin/salt-call", line 11, in <module>
    salt_call()
  File "/opt/apps/unix/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 410, in salt_call
    client.run()
  File "/opt/apps/unix/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/call.py", line 57, in run
    caller.run()
  File "/opt/apps/unix/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 134, in run
    ret = self.call()
  File "/opt/apps/unix/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 212, in call
    ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/opt/apps/unix/salt-2018.3.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/solarisips.py", line 477, in install
    if list(pkg.items())[0][1]:   # version specified
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'items'
```
This appears to be caused by the "pkg" str being treated as a dict (```pkg.items()```).

I thought about writing a fix for it but I'm unsure what the reasoning behind the dict assumption was.

Single package installs work fine.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On Solaris, run the pkg.install function with the pkgs arg as documented:
```
salt-call pkg.install pkgs='["pkg:/library/motif", "pkg:/compatibility/packages/SUNWxwplr"]'
```
