Steps to reproduce:
- Write a state without GPG keys informations

```
nginx_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Nginx repository
    - name: deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ wheezy nginx
    - dist: wheezy
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
    - require_in:
      - pkg: nginx
```

This state will succeed. Adding a nginx pkg.installed state will correctly fail as no key is present.
- Change your state to add GPG key infos:

```
nginx_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Nginx repository
    - name: deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ wheezy nginx
    - dist: wheezy
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
    - keyid: 7BD9BF62
    - keyserver: keyserver.ubuntu.com
    - require_in:
      - pkg: nginx
```

salt-call state.highstate will report:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state pkgrepo.managed for deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ wheezy nginx
[INFO    ] Package repo 'deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ wheezy nginx' already configured
```

And no key will be added. I'm not sure this should be considered a bug though?

This was tested using salt version 0.17.2.
