Steps to reproduce on Ubuntu Raring (Digital Ocean image) when salt-master is functioning correctly, with no changes made to configuration:

```
$> sudo service salt-master reload
$> sudo salt '*' test.ping
Traceback (most recent call last):

The same behaviour is also exhibited running:

```
$> sudo reload salt-master
```

I've looked myself, but I can't seem to understand what the problem is.

In this detached state when I run:

```
$> salt-master -l trace 
```

I get:

```
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/master
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/master
[INFO    ] Setting up the Salt Master
[WARNING ] Unable to bind socket, error: [Errno 98] Address already in use
The ports are not available to bind
```

Same fix sorts the problem (killing the processes and restarting salt-master).

I guess the bug is I expect a reload to do nothing if there is no configuration change, or reload the new configuration changes. This is not the case here.

P.S. I love Salt. I'm 2 days into it after seeing thatch45 talk about it at the SF Python Meetup. Amazing job.
