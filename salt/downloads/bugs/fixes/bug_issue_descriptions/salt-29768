I had a salt state that worked fine before I upgraded to the latest open source salt version. 

Here's the state:

```
Install and run service 'at' (job scheduler):
  pkg.installed:
    - name: at
  service.running:
    - name: atd
    - enable: True
    - watch: 
      - pkg: Install and run service 'at' (job scheduler)
```

Here's the error I get:

```
----------
          ID: Install and run service 'at' (job scheduler)
    Function: service.running
        Name: atd
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'service.running' was not found in SLS 'test'
              Reason: 'service' __virtual__ returned False
     Started: 
    Duration: 
     Changes:   
```

Here's versions report:
