### Description of Issue/Question
Trying to setup status beacon in new version running on vagrant.  Minion throws an error each time it fires.

[CRITICAL] The beacon errored: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 2153, in handle_beacons
    beacons = self.process_beacons(self.functions)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 409, in process_beacons
    return self.beacons.process(b_conf, self.opts['grains'])  # pylint: disable=no-member
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/beacons/__init__.py", line 100, in process
    raw = self.beacons[fun_str](b_config[mod])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/beacons/status.py", line 131, in beacon
    ret[func][item] = data[int(item)]
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'


### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

/etc/salt/minion.d/beacon.conf:
```
beacons:
  status:
   - interval: 10
```

I have also tried:
```
beacons:
  status:
    interval: 10
```

and:
```
beacons:
  status: {}
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
