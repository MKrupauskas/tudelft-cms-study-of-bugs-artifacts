The responsible code is here; asking sysctl for binary result ("-b") includes a null-terminator as seen below
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2ed9e6c9ca8d0ecfefaaaee92ff661bed49cf739/salt/grains/core.py#L2813-L2820


```
$ sysctl -b hw.model | hexdump
0000000 4d 61 63 50 72 6f 37 2c 31 00
```

This causes problems when e.g. writing the value of that grain into a file via template, because jinja is happy to include the null-character as part of the file.


Thanks, and here's my version report if helpful.
