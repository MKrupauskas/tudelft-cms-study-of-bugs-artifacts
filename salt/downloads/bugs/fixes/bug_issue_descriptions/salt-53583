### Description of Issue
`pkg.installed` does not seem to consider packages that are provided but not directly installed.

Concretely, the `containerd.io` package (from `https://download.docker.com/linux/debian`) says it Provides and Conflicts with the `runc` package (which is available from the Debian repos).

### Setup
On a debian buster minion:
```
docker-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian {{grains['oscodename']}} stable'
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    - key_url: https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg

containerd.io: pkg.installed
```
```
runc: pkg.installed
```

This will produce flapping states, where `containerd.io` uninstalls `runc` and `runc` uninstalls `containerd.io` (even though `containerd.io` claims it Provides `runc`).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Set up a minion running Debian Buster (testing)
2. Apply the above states
