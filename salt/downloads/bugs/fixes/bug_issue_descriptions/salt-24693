I have rabbitmq state which uses deploy rpm inside my file_roots. Due to the fact that this always returns false on node that has rabbitmq already installed I am unable to use requisite logic. If installing a rpm package from the local file system Salt should determine if this is already installed it should return True instead of False.

``` yaml

          ID: rabbitmq-server
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
