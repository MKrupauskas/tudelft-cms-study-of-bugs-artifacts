I am running into problems with cmd.run statements. I have often recurring pattern where I have a configuration file with a watch_in pointing to a cmd.run state to run an update process. Sometimes this cmd.run fails, but when I fix the cause of that failure the command is never retried. This forces me to either run it manually it make another change in the configuration file to trick salt into rerunning the command, neither of which is ideal.

What I would like to see is for salt to remember that a failure in a state which was triggered due to a change in another watched state so it will retry this later. Perhaps keep a list of pending/failed watches that is retried on a highstate or similar call?
