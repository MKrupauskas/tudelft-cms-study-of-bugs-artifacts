Package: salt-ssh
Version: 2014.1.1+ds-1
Severity: important

Dear Maintainer,

Since last upgrade (I think after 0.17, so 2014.1.0+ds-1), I can not use
anymore salt-ssh.

Here is the backtrace :
sudo salt-ssh 'host*' test.ping                                                                                                                              1 
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: 'ssh_user'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-ssh", line 10, in <module>
    salt_ssh()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 108, in salt_ssh
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/**init**.py", line 369, in run
    ssh = salt.client.ssh.SSH(self.config)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/client/ssh/**init**.py", line 202, in **init**
    salt.config.DEFAULT_MASTER_OPTS['ssh_user']

I tried to replace the user entry in my /etc/salt/roster by ssh_user, but it's not working.
I don't know where salt search for a default master option with the name ssh_user...
