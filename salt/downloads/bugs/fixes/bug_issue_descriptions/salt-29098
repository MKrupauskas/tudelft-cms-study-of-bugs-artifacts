This is for the Ubuntu apt repository, not sure about the others.
It appears that on repo.saltstack.com, when a Salt branch gets updated (e.g. 2015.8.0 -> 2015.8.1), that old versions (e.g.  2015.8.0) are no longer available to install from the repository. I would like to pin the exact version of Salt installed and continue using repo.saltstack.com instead of standing up my own repository, but removing old versions from repo.saltstack.com means that installs suddenly start failing. I don't have experience with handling multiple versions on ubuntu, but I've seen a few issues that mention multiple versions support (#27542, #27040, #28745).

Alternately, if there is a way to install Salt on Ubuntu that allows me to pin the exact version installed, please let me know how to do that.
