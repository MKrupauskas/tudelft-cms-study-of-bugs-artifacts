Should state requires have the function associated with them as well?

For example, the require passes in this example even though it's contradictory to what we want:

```
smbfs:
    pkg.removed

/mnt/ostenso:
    mount.mounted:
        - device: //server/share
        - fstype: smbfs
        - mkmnt: True
        - require:
            - pkg.installed: smbfs
```

I don't think the require should allow mount to run in this case.
