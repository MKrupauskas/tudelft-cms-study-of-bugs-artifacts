When deploying a guest OS with salt-cloud vmware driver that isn't customizable by VMware and specifying a network adapter configuration in the profile, it's correctly deployed and the network adapter configured fine, but salt-cloud fails with: 

``` Error:
        Error creating freebsd-server1: (vim.fault.UncustomizableGuest) {
           dynamicType = <unset>,
           dynamicProperty = (vmodl.DynamicProperty) [],
           msg = "Customization of the guest operating system 'freebsd64Guest' is not supported in this configuration. Microsoft Vista (TM) and Linux guests with Logical Volume Manager are supported only for recent ESX host and VMware Tools versions. Refer to vCenter documentation for supported configurations.",
           faultCause = <unset>,
           faultMessage = (vmodl.LocalizableMessage) [],
           uncustomizableGuestOS = 'freebsd64Guest'
        }
```

There is no customization of the guest happening, so that shouldn't fail. 

Take the following cloud.profile for instance: 

``` freebsd10_2:
  provider: my-vmware
  clonefrom: freebsd-10_2-template
  cluster: MyCluster
  devices:
    network:
      Network adapter 1:
        name: my-vswitch
        switch_type: standard
```

Where freebsd-10_2-template is a vCenter template of FreeBSD 10.2. Same would happen for any template whose GuestOS is set to any OS that doesn't support guest customization. 

The vmware driver is touching something there unnecessarily that makes it fail.
