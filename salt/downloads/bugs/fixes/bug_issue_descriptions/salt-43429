### Description of Issue/Question

I've installed saltstack via brew. Doing so I discovered two things:
- `/etc/salt` is actually located at `/usr/local/etc/saltstack/master`
- installing dependencies is actually harder than installing salt within a virtualenv

So I proceeded to install it via `pip` instead.

My `/usr/local/etc/saltstack/master` looks like:
```yaml
##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
user: myuser
root_dir: /usr/local/var/saltstack
conf_file: /usr/local/etc/saltstack

engines:
  - slack: 
      token: 'xoxbb' # this is a legacy token
      control: True
      groups:
        default:
          valid_users:
            - slackuser
          valid_commands:
            - test.ping
            - list_jobs
            - list_commands
            - jobs.list_jobs
            - pillar.get
          aliases:
            list_jobs:
              cmd: jobs.list_jobs
            list_commands:
              cmd: pillar.get salt:engines:slack:valid_commands target=saltmaster tgt_type=list
     
sock_dir: /usr/local/var/run/saltstack/master
log_file: /usr/local/var/log/salt/master

```

An my start command is like so: `~/venvs/salt/bin/salt-master -c /usr/local/etc/saltstack -l debug`


Yet I keep getting messages `CRITICAL` error messages as if the engine is not respecting my config file:

```

```

and these messages only appear after I had to manually create the folders: `mkdir -p /var/cache/salt/master` which I should not have to create as my `root_dir` is `/usr/local/var/saltstack` hence I should have `/usr/local/var/saltstack/cache/salt/master`

**Notice** how it says `[DEBUG   ] Missing configuration file: /etc/salt/master` even though I've started it specifying where the master conf file is and set it inside the conf file.

Also it seems the slack client hits the rate limiting quite fast in this scenario.

What can I do to fix this?
