I have updated the environment variables in minion, but not able to fetch those value via salt master. It works only after restarting the minion.
We are updating the env variables via other tool on Minions but not via environ.setenv module

Is there any way to refresh the env variables in minion after updating? so that a restart is not required all the time which is not feasible.

Could any pone suggest a way?
