This way salt-ssh projects using `root_dir` can manage their project's spm packages.

Current setup (working great with a self-contained project salt-ssh):

Saltfile

``` sls
salt-ssh:
  config_dir: ./deploy
  log_file: ./deploy/logs
  max_procs: 30
  wipe_ssh: True
```

./deploy/master

``` sls
file_roots:
  base:
    - ./deploy/salt

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - ./pillar

roster_file: ./deploy/roster

root_dir: ./deploy
```

What should work:

salt --version
salt 2015.8.1 (Beryllium)

Saltfile

``` sls
spm:
  config_dir: ./deploy
  log_file: ./deploy/logs
```

What happens now, config from Saltfile detected:

```
spm install apache
[WARNING ] Failed to open log file, do you have permission to write to /var/log/salt/master?
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache/salt/spm'
