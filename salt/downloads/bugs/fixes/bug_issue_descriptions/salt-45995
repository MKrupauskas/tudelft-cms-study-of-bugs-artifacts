### Description of Issue

If you leave Comment out of your state it's being interpreted as an empty string `''` whereas the upstream field is actually `None` not `''`

This means that the state is always making changes unnecessarily based on the Comment.

If the incoming Comment is set to `None` when empty not `''` then the comparison works properly and the state doesn't make any changes.
