### Description of Issue/Question
As documented it is allowed to set the mode for a file.symlink. There is no problem to set the mode and the state is rendered and applied sucessfully, but somehow the mode get's ignored in any case.
The user:group works how it should.

Saltstack doc's: [https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.symlink](url)
> mode
    The permissions to set on this file, aka 644, 0775, 4664. Not supported on Windows

### Setup
example_symlink:
  file.symlink:
    - name: /root/example/file.txt
    - target: /root/src.txt
    - mode: 0444

OR

example_symlink:
  file.symlink:
    - name: /root/example/file.txt
    - target: /root/src.txt
    - user: root
    - group: wheel
    - mode: 0444

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
As far as i can see the mode is set to "None" in "salt/states/file.py" and is not used/set anymore after.
So it results in beeing ignored.
