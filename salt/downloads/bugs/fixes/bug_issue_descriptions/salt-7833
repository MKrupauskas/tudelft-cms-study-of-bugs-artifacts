The system.shutdown execution module looks unusable in its current form on probably any GNU/Linux distribution.

```
root@master:~# salt '*' system.shutdown
minion01.example.com:
    shutdown: time expected
    Try `shutdown --help' for more information.
```

Looking at salt/modules/system.py, the 'shutdown' command is called without any provision for user-specified parameters. It doesn't have '-h now' hard-coded either.

Happy to supply a patch (which would likely be trivial), but I'm not sure which approach was intended. I see we have support for 'halt' (which is generally effectively the same as "shutdown -h now", so I guess supporting parameters is the way to go.

However, if adding parameters for shutdown, why not add them to halt, reboot, etc as well? Having them only for shutdown would seem inconsistent. Then again, if you're accepting parameters, is there actually any advantage to calling:

`salt 'some-instance' system.shutdown -h now`

over

`salt 'some-instance' cmd.run shutdown -h now`

(other than having to type one character less)? Maybe it can all disappear?

In short, it doesn't work currently, but I don't know how you would like to see it fixed. :)
