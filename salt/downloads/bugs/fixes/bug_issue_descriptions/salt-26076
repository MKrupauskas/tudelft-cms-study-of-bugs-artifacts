The user.present state seems to add literal None's in the GECOS field for the user.

This state:

``` yaml
nginx-systemuser:
  user.present:
    - name: nginx
    - fullname: nginx worker
    - system: True
    - createhome: False
    - shell: /usr/sbin/nologin
```

results in `grep nginx /etc/passwd`:

```
nginx:x:998:998:nginx worker,None,None,None:/home/nginx:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

Using `user.add nginx` directly does not seem to make the issue appear, that results in a `nginx worker,,,`, which is fair enough.

Salt version `2015.8.0rc3`.
