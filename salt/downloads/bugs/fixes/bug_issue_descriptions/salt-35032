### Description of Issue/Question

If the archive.extracted state is run on a tar file that fails to extract, the "bad" file will be left in cache and future attempts to run the same archive.extracted state will always fail.  Occurs if using the external tar command or python extraction
### Setup

```
extract_archive:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /some/place/to/extract
    - source: /badfile.tar
    - archive_format: tar
    - if_missing: /some/place/to/extract/expected.file
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
#touch /badfile.tar

#salt-call state.single archive.extracted name=/some/place/to/extract source=/badfile.tar archive_format=tar if_missing=/some/place/to/extract/expected.file
<state will fail>

#ls -al /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base
<bad archive is in cache, example above file is named "_some_place_to_extract_expected.file.tar>

#touch expected.file
#tar -cvf /badfile.tar expected.file

 #salt-call state.single archive.extracted name=/some/place/to/extract source=/badfile.tar archive_format=tar if_missing=/some/place/to/extract/expected.file
<state fails again, though now badfile.tar is actually a good file>

#rm /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_some_place_to_extract_expected.file.tar
 #salt-call state.single archive.extracted name=/some/place/to/extract source=/badfile.tar archive_format=tar if_missing=/some/place/to/extract/expected.file
<state succeeds>
```

1) if the cache path exists, it isn't checked that it matches the file we want to extract (offending snippet from archive.py)(https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/c43bd8fabeedb7cd0ca8dcc345d2bbb579080e00/salt/states/archive.py#L312)

2) if an error occurs while expanding the tar file, returns are processed and the cache is never cleaned up.

It appears a similar issue would occur if keep=True initially (initial file left in cache), but later wanted to extract a new archive (the new archive would never make it to the cache to be extracted)
