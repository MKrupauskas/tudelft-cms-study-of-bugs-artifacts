### Description of Issue/Question

In the documentation, __virtualname__ is defined as being used only by the documentation system. But it also seems to be used somewhere in Salt to permute the name of the package being loaded.

This came up when I was trying to use `salt.modules.runit` even after providing a 'provider' line in my service state, as given in the docs. Further testing showed that the module would fail to LazyLoad without showing any error, even when just being called directly as a module (not as a state). 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Attempt to use `runit` on any system where it's not the init system:
```
root@ubuntu:~# salt '*' runit.get_all
test-0:
    'runit.get_all' is not available.
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
root@ubuntu:~# vim /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/runit.py
# Comment out line 83 `__virtualname__ = 'service'`
root@ubuntu:~# salt '*' runit.get_all
test-0:
    - foo.runit
root@ubuntu:~#
```
