If a provider requires apache-libcloud to run, we should help users out with some nicer reporting. For example, if you use the openstack driver with rackspace in the cloud provider file, and apache libcloud hasn't been installed yet, the following warning is displayed:

```
[WARNING ] The cloud driver, 'openstack', configured under the 'rackspace' cloud provider alias was not loaded since 'openstack.get_configured_provider()' could not be found. Removing it from the available providers list
```

A message like "The openstack driver requires apache-libcloud" to be installed could be more helpful.
