After upgrading to 2014.7.0 some of my states are reported as a change, but they didn't change anything:

```
         ID: /var/drbd/www/html/ilias4/Services/Calendar/classes/class.ilDatePresentation.php
    Function: file.replace
      Result: None
     Comment: No changes were made

          ID: /usr/local/bin/ilias_cron.sh 2>/dev/null
    Function: cron.present
      Result: None
     Comment: Cron /usr/local/bin/ilias_cron.sh 2>/dev/null is set to be updated
     Started: 11:04:43.794855
    Duration: 125.617 ms
     Changes:   
```

This leads to false positives in a script monitoring pending changes via Icinga/Nagios.

Previous version works fine.
