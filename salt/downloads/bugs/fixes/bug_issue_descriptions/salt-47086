### Description of Issue/Question

mysql_grant fails with error "MySQL Error 1144: Illegal GRANT/REVOKE command;" for certain simple priv_level with global scope (eg: PROCESS, SUPER).

### Setup

SLS uses the following definition:

```
metricbeat:
  ...
  mysql_user:
    - present
    - host: '%'
    - password: metricbeat
    - require:
      - service: mysql
  mysql_grants:
    - present
    - grant: PROCESS
    - database: '*.*'
    - user: metricbeat
    - host: '%'
    - require:
      - mysql_user: metricbeat
```

Minion uses the following to provide MySQL admin access via `/etc/salt/minion`:

```mysql.default_file: "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf"```

"MySQL" server is MariaDB 10.1.32

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

With setup and SLS above, run `salt-cale state.highstate`, the following error will be generated:

```
[ERROR   ] MySQL Error 1144: Illegal GRANT/REVOKE command; please consult the manual to see which privileges can be used
[ERROR   ] Failed to execute: "GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO metricbeat@%" (MySQL Error 1144: Illegal GRANT/REVOKE command; please consult the manual to see which privileges can be used)
```

And the following error in the highstate summary:

```
ID: metricbeat
    Function: mysql_grants.present
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to execute: "GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO metricbeat@%" (MySQL Error 1144: Illegal GRANT/REVOKE command; please consult the manual to see which privileges can be used)
     Started: 09:00:21.236148
    Duration: 9.586 ms
```

Running the generated SQL statement `GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO metricbeat@%` directly via the MariaDB console also gives the following error:

```
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT process ON *.* TO metricbeat@%;
ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '%' at line 1
```

However, correcting the SQL statement to quote the host wildcard `GRANT process ON *.* TO metricbeat@'%';` results in a successful execution:

```
MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT process ON *.* TO metricbeat@'%';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

Other mysql_grant definitions which also use a `%` host wildcard but have more common priv_levels (eg: ALL PRIVILEGES, SELECT, etc.) seem to have no issue, on same host with same MariaDB version, and on other hosts with MariaDB or MySQL versions.
