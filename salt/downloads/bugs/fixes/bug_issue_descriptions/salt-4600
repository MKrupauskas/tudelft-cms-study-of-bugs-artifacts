In pillars/top.sls, if I have a nodegroup targetted:

```
'layer1':
  - match: nodegroup
  - secrets
```

It seems to be ignored.  I've tested other variations which are also ignored:

```
'N@layer1':
  - match: compound
  - secrets
```

The nodegroup itself is well defined, as it can be used in matching in the CLI successfully:

```
# salt -N 'layer1' test.ping
theserver:
    True
```
