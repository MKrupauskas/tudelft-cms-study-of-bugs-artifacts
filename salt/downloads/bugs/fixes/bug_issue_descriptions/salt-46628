### Description of Issue/Question

We have our custom FreeBSD Repository, where we store updated version of some packages. We just update salt to 2017.7.4 and we found and issue while using `pkg.latest`

This is what salt executes, to get package version, in this case for Nginx. There are a few messages with *DEBUG*, those are some lines added by me to get more info while debugging the issue

```
[DEBUG   ] DEBUG - Command: ['pkg', 'search', '-S', 'name', '-Q', 'version', '-e', '-q', 'nginx']
[INFO    ] Executing command ['pkg', 'search', '-S', 'name', '-Q', 'version', '-e', '-q', 'nginx'] in directory '/home/abednarik'
[DEBUG   ] DEBUG - Package: nginx, Version: 1.12.2_3,2
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad pkg.normalize_name: 'pkg.normalize_name' is not available.
[INFO    ] Executing command ['pkg', 'install', '-r', 'Perceptyx', '-y', 'nginx'] in directory '/home/abednarik'
[INFO    ] Executing command ['pkg', 'info', '-ao'] in directory '/home/abednarik'
[ERROR   ] Made the following changes:
'nginx' changed from 'absent' to '1.12.2_10,2'
```

As you can see, the search command returns version *1.12.2_3,2* while *1.12.2_10,2* is the latest one from our repos and is the one installed.

State fails, I think [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2017.7.4/salt/states/pkg.py#L2417-L2420) because installed version is not the same as the one salt stores as the latest one.


```yml
----------
          ID: nginx
    Function: pkg.latest
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to update: nginx
     Started: 12:25:14.197295
    Duration: 1451.617 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              nginx:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      1.12.2_10,2
                  old:
```

If I change `reverse=False` [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2017.7.4/salt/modules/pkgng.py#L318-L320) things work as expected.

### Setup

This is the state

```yml
nginx:
  pkg.latest:
    - name: {{ nginx_pkg }}
{%- if grains['os'] == 'FreeBSD' %}
    - require:
      - cmd: repository_update
    - fromrepo: Company
{% endif %}
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - watch:
      - file: {{ nginx_config_dir }}
    - require:
      - pkg: {{ nginx_pkg }}
      - file: /var/log/nginx
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Well you need to have your custom FreeBSD repositories, with an updated version of Nginx or any other package and use pkg.latest
