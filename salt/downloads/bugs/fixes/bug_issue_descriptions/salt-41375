### Description of Issue/Question
```
schedule:
  test_job:
    enabled: true
    function: test.ping
    jid_include: false
    return_job: false
    seconds: 10
```
job added 
```
  test_job: {enabled: true, function: test.ping, jid_include: false, minutes: 60,
    return_job: false, seconds: 10}
```

edit job to

```
schedule:
  test_job:
    enabled: true
    function: test.ping
    jid_include: false
    minutes: 10
```
job added 
```
  test_job: {enabled: true, function: test.ping, jid_include: false, minutes: 60,
    return_job: false, seconds: 10}
```

I dunno if this is the desired behaviour. Imo the new job should replace all variables of the old if it has the same job name. In case this is the desired behaviour I think it should be documented.
