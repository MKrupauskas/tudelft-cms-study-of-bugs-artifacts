**Description**
Since I started trying out the saltcheck, I have gotten multiple exceptions like this. I don't know what exactly causes them, because the message is not really helpful. I was trying to implement simple tests for already working apache, just to learn how to implement tests. It should test if the directory exists and if `index.html` is present, just to try out `assertions` option. I can put there basically anything valid and it just raises this error when I use this option.

**Setup**
```
test_public_html_present:
  module_and_function: cmd.run
  args:
    - ls /var/www/html/{{ salt['pillar'].get('domain') }}/public_html
  assertions:
    - assertion: assertNotEmpty
    - assertion: assertContains
      expected_return: index.html
  print_result: True
  output_details: True
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
 - Implement `saltcheck-tests/apache.tst`
 - Run `sudo salt 'minion2' saltcheck.run_highstate_tests` on master

**Expected behavior**
I expected that test will pass or fail with a proper error message.

**Output**
```
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1676, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
