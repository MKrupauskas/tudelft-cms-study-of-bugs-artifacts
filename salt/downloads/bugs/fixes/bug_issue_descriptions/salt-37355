### Description of Issue/Question
Issue already described many times in two other issues but both are closed and issue is not fixed.
#### Linked issues
- #34600 
- #27355

### Setup
- Ubuntu 14.04 + salt-ssh 2016.3.3 on source system
- Ubuntu 12.04 on target system

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Install salt-ssh 2016.3.3
- run a highstate on a Ubuntu 12.04 target
- Result: ImportError:  No module named backports.ssl_match_hostname

### Reason for issue
ssl_match_hostname.py is inside thin.tgz as py2/salt/ext/ssl_match_hostname.py but the running python scripts can't find it because they import backports.ssl_match_hostname.

### Workaround
I simply add a symlink for backports folder to thin.tgz as py2/backports -> salt/ext.
