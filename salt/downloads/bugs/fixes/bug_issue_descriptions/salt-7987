When we have a remote fileclient cached and the salt master is restarted in - between the execution, the fileclient becomes unusable.

Consider this sls:

```
test:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/test-restart-salt0
    - source: salt://test.sls
    - require_in:
      - cmd: trigger-restart

test2:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/test-restart-salt2
    - source: salt://test.sls
    - require_in:
      - cmd: trigger-restart

trigger-restart:
  cmd.run:
    - name: rm -f /tmp/test-restart-salt{0,1,2}
    - require_in:
      - service: salt-master

salt-master:
  cmd.run:
    - name: service salt-master stop;service salt-master start
    - require_in:
      - cmd: test-1

test-1:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/test-restart-salt1
    - source: salt://test.sls

cleanup:
  cmd.run:
    - name: rm -f /tmp/test-restart-salt{0,1,2}
    - order: last

```

It will actually fail with

```

This can be easily mitigated by renogating the authentication crypticle with the restarted master, see incoming attached pull request
