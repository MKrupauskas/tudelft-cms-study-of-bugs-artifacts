### Description of Issue/Question
state file:
```
  pip.installed:
    - name: haproxyctl >= 0.5
    - find_links: https://github.com/neurogeek/haproxyctl/archive/
    - reload_modules: True
```
This runs OK if I do salt minion1 state.apply haproxy
But if I run salt minion1 state.highstate, I got an error
```
Function: pip.installed
        Name: haproxyctl >= 0.5
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'pip.installed' was not found in SLS 'haproxy'
              Reason: 'pip.installed' is not available.
     Changes:
```
there's also some errors in /var/log/salt/minion:
