We are tracking using munin http://munin-monitoring.org/ the number of hosts that should be removed from our master by periodically running "salt-run manage.down" and counting the results. 

There are spikes in our graphs and sometimes we get incoherent results from the command line. Any idea on what is causing this and how to debug it and fix it ?
