Running a highstate on minions with some NFS mounts results in the mount being remounted every time. This did not occur under 2014.1

                  Forced remount because options changed
```

Running mount -l shows the following:

```
...
nfshost:/nfsmnt on /nfsmnt type nfs (rw,remount,tcp,bg,hard,intr,addr=x.x.x.x)
```

I can only assume it's breaking due to the addr option (which is automatically filled by the OS by the looks of it, it was never manually specified as a mount option) or the ordering.

The mount.mounted state looks as follows:

```
/nfsmnt:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: nfshost:/nfsmnt
    - fstype: nfs
    - opts: rw,tcp,bg,hard,intr
```
