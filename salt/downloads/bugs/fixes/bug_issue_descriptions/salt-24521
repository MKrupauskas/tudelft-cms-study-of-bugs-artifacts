The following state:

``` yaml
eth0:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: true
    - type: eth
    - ipaddr: 1.2.3.4
```

produces a `/etc/network/interfaces` file on Debian with the following content:

```
auto eth0
    address 1.2.3.4
```

But it is then unable to parse it back (I just tried to reapply the exact same state just after the first run):

``` python
          ID: eth0
    Function: network.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

After "fixing" this bug, there is also a (at least one) subsequent failure dues to undefined variable such as `iface_dict` from the following line.

``` yaml

I may have a look at this one.
