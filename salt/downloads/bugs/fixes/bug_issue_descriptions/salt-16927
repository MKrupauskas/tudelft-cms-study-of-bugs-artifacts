When using git.latest together with user:

```
https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git:
    git.latest:
        - target: /myuser/.oh-my-zsh
        - rev: master
        - user: myuser
```

you will get an error:

`Environment could not be retrieved for User 'myuser'`

Without user:

```
https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git:
    git.latest:
        - target: /myuser/.oh-my-zsh
        - rev: master
```

everything works fine
