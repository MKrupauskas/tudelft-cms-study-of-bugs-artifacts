### Description of Issue/Question
Currently, when a user on the publisher_acl list issues a command that is not on their allow list, they are presented with "Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage)." message. This is the correct behavior. 

When I am looking over the /var/log/salt/master log, I see 'Authentication failure of type "user" occurred.' as the event. 

In the source for master.py, I see on Line [1802](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/master.py#L1802) the ability to have the user name mentioned in the logs. 

Maybe I am just not doing something correctly to get that user information to pass to the logs.

I would appreciate any help. Thank you.
### Setup


master config

 ```yaml
sudo_acl: True

 publisher_acl:
   test_user:
     - test.*
```


That should allow sudo user test_user to only issue `salt "*" test.*` commands to the salt master.
