### Description of Issue/Question

I am getting an error when trying to create a napalm proxy
`Unable to merge mine functions from the pillar in the opts, for proxy`

This seems to be caused by inconsistencies in the code merging the mine_functions key from config and pillar data. The mine.update documentation indicates that the mine_functions key should be a dictionary. But the code in salt.minion.ProxyMinion._post_master_init() treats the key as a list.

```python
            if 'mine_functions' in self.opts['pillar']:
                general_proxy_mines = self.opts.get('mine_functions', [])
                specific_proxy_mines = self.opts['pillar']['mine_functions']
                try:
                    self.opts['mine_functions'] = general_proxy_mines + specific_proxy_mines
```

So if you configure mine_functions in your pillar (or your config) as a list, then you hit a problem in mine.update where it fetches \_\_salt\_\_['config.merge']('mine_functions', {}) which will return a list, and assigned this to m_data which is assumed to be a dict further down the code. 

```python
    if not mine_functions:
        m_data = __salt__['config.merge']('mine_functions', {})
        # If we don't have any mine functions configured, then we should just bail out
        if not m_data:
            return
    elif mine_functions and isinstance(mine_functions, list):
        m_data = dict((fun, {}) for fun in mine_functions)
    elif mine_functions and isinstance(mine_functions, dict):
        m_data = mine_functions
    else:
        return
```

I worked around this by changing the code in mine.update by assigning the mine_functions key from config.merge to mine_functions and unchaining the enclosing if statement (if not mine_functions:) from the next two if statements that check the type of mine_functions. 

But basically someone needs to decide if mine_functions should be a list or a dict or both and support whatever is decided as the right representation. 

### Setup
```yaml
/etc/salt/proxy.d/env.conf
saltenv: proxy
pillarenv: proxy

/srv/proxy/pillar/napalm/init.sls
mine_functions:
  bgp.neighbors: []
  net.ipaddrs: []
  net.lldp: []
  net.mac: []
  net.arp: []
  net.interfaces: []
mine_interval: 60
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create a napalm proxy using the setup above. When you start the proxy, you will get the error failing to merge the mine functions. 

If you change mine_functions into a list

```yaml
/srv/proxy/pillar/napalm/init.sls
mine_functions:
  - bgp.neighbors
  - net.ipaddrs
  - net.lldp
  - net.mac
  - net.arp
  - net.interfaces
mine_interval: 60
```

This will fix the merge error. But when you run mine.update on the proxy, you then get an error 

```
[ERROR   ] Function bgp.neighbors in mine_functions failed to execute
[DEBUG   ] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/modules/mine.py", line 151, in update
    if m_data[func] and isinstance(m_data[func], dict):
TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
```

Changing the code in mine.update to look like this:
```python
    if not mine_functions:
        mine_data = __salt__['config.merge']('mine_functions', {})
        # If we don't have any mine functions configured, then we should just bail out
        if not mine_data:
            return
    if mine_functions and isinstance(mine_functions, list):
        m_data = dict((fun, {}) for fun in mine_functions)
    elif mine_functions and isinstance(mine_functions, dict):
        m_data = mine_functions
    else:
        return
```

Fixes the problem for me
