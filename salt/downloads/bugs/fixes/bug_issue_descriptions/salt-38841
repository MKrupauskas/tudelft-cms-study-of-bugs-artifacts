On CentOS 7, salt version 2016.11.1,  when using pkg.group_installed with a group that has packages marked with "-" (meaning don't install them), state.pkg.group_installed result is False even though the group's packages are installed successfully.

Here is my sls definition:

```
X Window system:
  pkg.group_installed:
    - include:
      - tigervnc-server-module
      - tigervnc-server-minimal
      - lightdm
    - require:
      - epel-repo-file

Xfce:
  pkg.group_installed:
    - require:
      - X Window system
```

Here is some info from the minion regarding yum's understanding of the group I want to install:

```
[test-user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum grouplist Xfce
[sudo] password for test-user:
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * epel: mirror.nexcess.net
Installed Groups:
   Xfce
Done
[test-user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum groupinfo Xfce
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile
 * epel: mirror.steadfast.net

Group: Xfce
 Group-Id: xfce-desktop
 Description: A lightweight desktop environment that works well on low end machines.
 Mandatory Packages:
    Thunar
   -xfce-utils
    xfce4-panel
    xfce4-session
    xfce4-settings
    xfconf
    xfdesktop
    xfwm4
 Default Packages:
   -NetworkManager-gnome
    gdm
   -leafpad
    openssh-askpass
    orage

   -xfce4-mixer
    xfce4-power-manager
    xfce4-session-engines

   -xfwm4-theme-nodoka
 Optional Packages:
   xfwm4-themes
 Conditional Packages:
    pinentry-gtk
[test-user@localhost ~]$
```

Here is the output from the salt-master when I try to run the state:

```
----------
          ID: Xfce
    Function: pkg.group_installed
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to install the following packages: xfce-utils, NetworkManager-gnome, leafpad, xfce4-icon-theme, xfce4-mixer, xfwm4-theme-nodoka

notice, the packages mentioned as failing to install are the same packages marked "don't install" by yum.

## Notes

I can work around this for now by manually specifying the packages from the group that need to be installed (not using group_installed). I also tried manually specifying the "disabled" packages using the  skip argument, but this doesn't work for disabled packages under the mandatory section.
