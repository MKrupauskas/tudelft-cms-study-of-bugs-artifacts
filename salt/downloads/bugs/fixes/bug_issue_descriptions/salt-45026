### Description of Issue/Question
I recently switch from python2.7 to python 3.6 and a lot of modules are stopped working.

The first issue is pip: #44980 
Second issue is mysql
```
Function: mysql_grants.present
      Result: False

All the issues I am having have similar errors:
```
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```
Can someone look at this?
