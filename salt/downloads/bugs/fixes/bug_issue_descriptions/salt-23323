On latest develop, `file.managed` breaks with HTTP sources, since the requests are now using tornado instead of requests, and thus the handling of the response is incorrect.

```
*** AttributeError: 'HTTPResponse' object has no attribute 'read'
```

I'm unfamiliar with tornado, so I don't know how to fix this, but the code present in [fileclient.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/fileclient.py#L607) only works for the requests backend. It also seems to not be covered by tests, since this managed to slip through.

I worked around this by manually specifying `backend='requests'` in the `salt.utils.http.query` call in `fileclient.py` on line 591.
