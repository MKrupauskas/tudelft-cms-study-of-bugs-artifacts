@Linuturk Thanks for the report.  I was able to reproduce this and then noticed that restarting the Salt minion as well caused the Salt master to attempt to send information along to the MySQL cache.  I did run into a different issue that appears to be a more serious bug:
```python
[ERROR   ] Error in function _pillar:
