**Description**
On Debian 10 the rendering of JSON and YAML strings via Jinja is performing extra HTML escaping which breaks the installed applications.

**Setup**
As an example, the state definition [here](https://github.com/mitodl/elastic-stack-formula/blob/elastalert_venv/elastic-stack/elastalert/configure.sls#L15-L24) works fine on Debian 9, producing output of the form:

```yaml
foo:
  bar: "some string"
```

but the same contents on Debian 10 get rendered as:

```yaml
foo:
  bar: &#39;some string&#39;
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run the linked state with any settings definition which contains quotation marks on a Debian 10 host.

**Expected behavior**
The dictionary contents get rendered without any HTML escaping.

**Additional context**
In order to work around this problem we changed some of our state files to use the PyObjects renderer and avoid the trip through Jinja. That resolved the symptom but the underlying bug remains. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/mitodl/consul-formula/blob/master/consul/config.sls)
