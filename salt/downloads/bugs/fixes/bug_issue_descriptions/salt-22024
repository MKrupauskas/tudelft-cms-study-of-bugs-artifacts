Easier to explain with examples:

asdf.sls:

``` YAML
prereq_command:
    cmd.run:
        - name: echo prereq
        - prereq:
            - cmd: asdf

asdf:
    cmd.wait:
        - name: echo asdf
        - watch:
            - cmd: fdsa

fdsa:
    cmd.run:
        - name: echo fdsa
```

I expect all 3 states to be run in the order of: fdsa, prereq_command, asdf

test=True output:

```
local:
----------
          ID: fdsa
    Function: cmd.run
        Name: echo fdsa
      Result: None

```

The test=True output claims that prereq_command won't be run, which is incorrect. Interesting enough, the state that is prereq'd (asdf) shows that it will be run but is shown in green not bold yellow.

When I run the state normally:

actual output (no test=True):

```

This exhibits the correct and expected behavior, however test=True mode didn't seem to agree. Reading the documentation on prereq, I believe having test=True mode be truthful is critical to the correctness of prereq states.
