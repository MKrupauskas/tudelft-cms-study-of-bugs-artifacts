When running: `salt-cloud -p digitalocean-test testing` to create a new instance on Digital Ocean, the instance is created and is present in the list of "Droplets", however a profile error is returned shortly after that:

```
salt-cloud: error: There was a profile error: A wrong password has been issued while establishing ssh session
```

Note: this is only broken on the develop branch. If I do the same command on 2014.1.4, the instance is created, salt installs, and everything returns appropriately.

/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/digital_ocean.conf
