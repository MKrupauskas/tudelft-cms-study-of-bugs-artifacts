## Problem Description

I'm using salt-ssh against a server running CentOS 7 and have a state file like so:

``` salt
network-config:
  network.system:
    - enabled: True
    - hostname: blargh
    - gateway: 10.76.30.1
    - gatewaydev: eth2
    - require_reboot: True
    - apply_hostname: True

eth4:
  network.managed:
    - enabled: True
    - type: eth
    - proto: none
    - mtu: 1500
    - hwaddr: 00:6b:dd:6b:dd:6b
```

Despite having "require_reboot" set to "True", a reboot is never initiated on the machine. The issue I'm trying to mitigate by rebooting is that I need to change the MAC Address assignments of the network interfaces and trying to restart the network service (or reset the network interfaces) after doing so will result in errors as the OS has already associated certain MAC Addresses with certain device names. It will also cause my machine to lose network connectivity and require manual intervention to resume remote communication.

Is this a salt-ssh specific problem? Does anyone have any experience trying this using a traditional mastion/minion setup? The other parameters in that section work such as the hostname and gateway, so I feel everything else is correct.
