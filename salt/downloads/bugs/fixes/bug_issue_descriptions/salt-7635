When I attempt to run ... <pre>salt-ssh '*' test.ping</pre> ... the hosts running VMWare ESXi 5.1.0[1] return the following value:

<pre>fattw-4-1:
    ------ An unexpected error occurred ------
    Error code: bGluZSAxODAsIGluIHN0YXJ0CiAgICBzZWxmLl9vbGRfdGVybWlvc19zZXR0aW5ncyA9IHRlcm1pb3MudGNnZXRhdHRyKDApCg==
    See logs for details
    
    error: (25, 'Inappropriate ioctl for device')
    
    deploy
</pre>


The issue it turns out is that busybox does not have the "install" command, and, the "install" command provided on ESXi hosts is different program entirely.
