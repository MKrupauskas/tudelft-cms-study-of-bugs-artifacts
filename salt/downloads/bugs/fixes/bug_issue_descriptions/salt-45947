### Description of Issue/Question
I have a state, which calls `file.absent` in order to remove a special file.
It says that file is not present, even though it exists.
I think this has to do with the following check in `salt/states/file.py`:

`if os.path.isfile(name) or os.path.islink(name):`

Would it be possible to also do `os.lstat()` and check whether `st_mode` passes `S_ISFIFO`, `S_ISCHR`, `S_ISBLK` and `S_ISSOCK` checks?
