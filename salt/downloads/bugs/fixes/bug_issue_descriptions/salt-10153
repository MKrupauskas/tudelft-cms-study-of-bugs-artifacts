On 64bits Windows, creating a key/value in, for example

```
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion...
```

will actually create the key in

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion...
```

There are some situations where the key/value that must be read/created/modified is not in the Wow6432Node subkey.

Currently it is not possible with reg module and reg state to enforce this. Adding an option to disable reflection in the usage of _winreg would solve this issue.
