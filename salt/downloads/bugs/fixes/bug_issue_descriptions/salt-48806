Hello,

I noticed that non-root users can execute the any salt-cloud command 'by default':
```
[vodka@cent_os_1 ~]$ salt-cloud -a create_snapshot asasas snapshot_name="just_for_fun" description="why not" memdump=False quiesce=False
[WARNING ] Failed to open log file, do you have permission to write to /var/log/salt/cloud?
The following virtual machines are set to be actioned with "create_snapshot":
  asasas

Proceed? [N/y] y
... proceeding
```

We receive only warning error. is it a normal behavior? Or is it a security issue?

Thanks.
