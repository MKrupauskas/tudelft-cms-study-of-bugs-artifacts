### Description of Issue/Question

The enable/disable actions occur before the check for `test=True`. Services are being enabled or disabled regardless of the `test=True` and is not being reported back.
### Setup

Disable a service.

Create a state to start the service and enable it.

```
start_spooler:
  service.running:
    - name: Spooler
    - enable: True
```

Apply the state with `test=True`

```
salt '<minion>' state.sls start_spooler
```

The service is now enabled, though started (unless it was already started). The state output says that only the service would be started, does not mention that the service was or would be enabled. Changes are being made that shouldn't be with `test=True`

The same thing occurs with `service.dead`
