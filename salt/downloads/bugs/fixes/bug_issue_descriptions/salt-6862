I have some salt-minion under Windows and some under Linux.

No problem with my Linux minions :)

I used Windows Minion on 2008R2, 2008 and 2003 with same results:

After a few hours of use i get a "Minion did not return" with all of my Windows minion that are not in the same VLAN as master.

On my minion i used Keepalive settings without success.
-  Only windows minion is concerned (0.16.0, 0.16.2, 0.16.3)
-  Connections between minion / master without firewall = OK
-  Connections between minion / master with firewall (Cisco) = KO after a few hours.
-  On master no tcp connection from faulty minions on tcp 4505. On minion a stuck TCP connection is in state "ESTABLISHED" ! If i restart minion or if i kill this shadow TCP connection, everything becomes OK.
-   If i use salt-call on minion, it opens TCP connection to master on 4506 and launchs commands but on connection on 4505 still stuck.

I didn't see something usefull in logs ( in debug or trace mode )

Example: This night i lost contact with ADM01 salt-minion at 22:05:52 (checked with netstat and a piece of script)

```

After 22:05 i still have trace of ADM01 but no TCP socket 4505 on server side.
