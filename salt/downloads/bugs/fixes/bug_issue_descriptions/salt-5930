I am in the process of writing a module for interacting with Redis.

However I am seeing some very strange behavior. In the module I connect to redis using the standard "redis.Redis" class to create the connection to the local (on the minion) Redis instance.

If I sync the modules then run it via salt-call on the minion, it works as expected. However, if I run it via the master such as 'salt minionname saltyredis.version' I get the following traceback:

"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Redis'"

So I created a function to return the result of dir(redis) and they are indeed different when called via the master process. 

Note: I named the module saltredis to avoid conflicts with the Redis module named redis.

So, any ideas as to why the minion gets a different result wen called via master vs. salt-call?
