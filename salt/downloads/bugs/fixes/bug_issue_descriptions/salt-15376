The `tls` module currently hardcodes SHA-1 as the signature hash algorithm. SHA-1 is considered increasingly insecure and is being deprecated by browsers. (See https://shaaaaaaaaaaaaa.com/ for more information.) Salt should switch to using SHA-256 or at least make the signature hash algorithm a configurable parameter for routines that sign certificates.
