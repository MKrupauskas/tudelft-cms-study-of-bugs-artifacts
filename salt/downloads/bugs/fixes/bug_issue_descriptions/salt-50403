### Description of Issue/Question
Salt states that it works with tornado<6.0.0 in base.txt but the metadata it installs does not follow the python version specifier.


    # grep tornado ~/.virtualenvs/salt-tornado/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt-2018.3.3.dist-info/METADATA
    Requires-Dist: tornado (<6.0,>=4.2.1)
    Requires-Dist: tornado (<5.0,>=4.2.1)

When pip installing you get these lines relating to tornado.
    Ignoring tornado: markers 'python_version >= "3.4"' don't match your environment
    Requirement already satisfied: tornado<6.0,>=4.2.1; python_version < "3" in /home/mthode/.virtualenvs/salt-tornado/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from salt==2018.3.3) (5.1.1)
    salt 2018.3.3 has requirement tornado<5.0,>=4.2.1, but you'll have tornado 5.1.1 which is incompatible.


### Setup
no setup

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create new virtualenv
2. pip install tornado===5.1.1
3. pip install salt (or pip install .)

### Versions Report
not installed, 2018.3.3 tested (from tag)
