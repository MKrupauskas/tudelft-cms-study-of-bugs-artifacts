I am surprised to see libvirt.serverkey.pem and libvirt.clientkey.pem private keys in my pillars for all (or most) machines connected to salt. And this even on machines that are not libvirt enabled (no virtualisation or libvirt installed)

I don't think we've activated this in our configuration (or at least we've removed it at some point). We've played around with the libvirt runner on some machines. 

In `/etc/salt/pki/master/libvirt/` there are keys for all the hosts connected to the master. 

Is this normal ? Can we disable it ? Is it a bug in http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/pillar/all/salt.pillar.libvirt.html ?
