  Below is an example of an error from salt-ssh that returns 0. Another I have seen is when the ssh connection to the host times out.

  I am trying to use jenkins and salt-ssh for deploys, but jenkins expects processes to return non-zero on a failure.

[ngrennan@bastion-01 salt-ssh]$ salt-ssh -i 'test' cmd.run 'test'
test:
    ----------
    retcode:
        255
    stderr:
        ssh: connect to host www.google.com port 22: Network is unreachable
    stdout:
[ngrennan@bastion-01 salt-ssh]$ echo $?
0
