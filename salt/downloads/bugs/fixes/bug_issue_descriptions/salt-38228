### Description of Issue/Question
Since in version 2016.11.0 "tar_options" has been replaced by "options" my state fails. The error message says that one dir is missing. It is because of the option. It was working before with tar_options.
I got this in two different states. Both are failing since the update.

### Setup
    seafile-server:
      archive.extracted:
        - name: /opt/seafile/seafile-server-6.0.6
        - source: https://bintray.com/artifact/download/seafile-org/seafile/seafile-server_6.0.6_x86-64.tar.gz 
        - archive_format: tar
        - user: seafile
        - group: seafile
        - skip_verify: True
        - options: "--strip=1"

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt-call state.sls seafile`

          ID: seafile-server
    Function: archive.extracted
        Name: /opt/seafile/seafile-server-6.0.6
      Result: False

              While trying to enforce user/group ownership, the following paths were missing:
