Since upgrading to 2014.7rc3, the archive state module throw an exception.

Here is my state definition:

highshare_install_{{ application['version'] }}:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /home/{{ website['name'] }}/{{ application['directory'] }}
    - source: salt://web/apps/highshare/files/highshare.{{ application['version'] }}.tar.gz
    - archive_format: tar
    - tar_options: xz
