### Description of Issue/Question
On AIX systems, the status.uptime (salt/modules/status.py) does not work for uptime <1 day.
An index error is raised for etime strings without a day prefix (before a "-").
OK: 7-20:46:46
Not OK:  20:46:46
The list variable "days" tries in all cases to index the fields before/after separator "-".
```
    bt_time = res['stdout']
    days = bt_time.split('-')
    hms = days[1].split(':')
```

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
I promise I will learn how to handle git PR.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
salt aixhost1 status.uptime
