I'm facing the following issue running a highstate command with a very simple top file:
Salt version: 2015.8.5 (Beryllium)
Host: Windows 2012R2 VM 
Single minion running in masterless mode

```
C:\salt\srv\salt>salt-call state.highstate -l debug --local
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from c:\salt\conf\minion
[DEBUG   ] Using cached minion ID from c:\salt\conf\minion_id: WIN-M9GCE6IBR1K.xyz.net
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: c:\salt\conf\minion
[WARNING ] Insecure logging configuration detected! Sensitive data may be logged

[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded state.highstate
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded grains.get
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded saltutil.is_running
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded roots.envs

Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
```

Upon digging into salt code by following trace output, turns out saltutil.is_running check is the issue. I verified that upon commenting the state function running check below, my top.sls gets properly processed on a highstate call.

```
salt/modules/state.py: Line 119
active =  __salt__['saltutil.is_running']('state.*')
```

Even running this raises the "Exiting gracefully.." message:

```
$> salt-call saltutil.is_running state.highstate
local:
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
```

I am digging in further to find out why **attempting to get list of running jobs on this minion is raising a KeyboardInterrupt exception**. Any ideas why checking state with saltutil.is_running is raising this error?

Although I'm fairly certain my state files have nothing to do with this issue, here they are for reference:
top.sls:

```
base:
  '*':
    - service
```

service.sls:

```
Power:
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - reload: True
```
