The documentation reads as such(https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/aws.html):

```
  volumes:
    - { size: 100, device: /dev/sde, type: gp2 }
    - { size: 100, device: /dev/sdf, type: gp2 }
  del_root_vol_on_destroy: True
  del_all_vols_on_destroy: True
```

If you write a file as above, it ignores these values, and does not delete the EC2 volumes.

If you write the file as follows:

```
  del_root_vol_on_destroy: True
  del_all_vols_on_destroy: True
  volumes:
    - { size: 100, device: /dev/sde, type: gp2 }
    - { size: 100, device: /dev/sdf, type: gp2 }
```

It appears that del*_on_destroy must be before the volumes, not after.

This is financially dangerous, as the failure is completely silent, and leads to orphaned EBS volumes. In our case, I had to clean up several hundred from salt-stack deploys.
