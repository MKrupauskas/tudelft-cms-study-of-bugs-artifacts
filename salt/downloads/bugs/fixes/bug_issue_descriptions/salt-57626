**Description**
I have a salt master which is configured with 3 reactor/orchestrate pairs. The master listens to messages from network devices via napalm-logs, then performs 3 tasks -

1. updates a mariadb with the event details

2. updates the db with the host details

3. runs a python script which connects to the network device and collects further information to add to the db.

As the number of messages has increased, I'm noticing that more of the jobs are failing with either of these 2 responses. The errors are sporadic and not linked to specific network devices.

Can `state.orchestrate` only run one job at a time, so if a second `state.orchestrate` is called from the reactor, whilst the first is running, the second job will fail?

```
"The function \"state.orchestrate\" is running as PID 6668 and was started at 2020, Jun 10 19:11:53.798538 with jid 20200610191153798538"
```

```

```

**Setup**

```
/etc/salt # more master.d/reactors.conf
reactor:
  - 'napalm/syslog/*/*/*':
    - salt://reactor/register_host_in_db.sls
    - salt://reactor/register_event_in_db.sls

  - 'napalm/syslog/junos/PAM_AUTH/*':
    - salt://reactor/interrogate_node.sls
```

```
/etc/salt # more reactor/register_host_in_db.sls

register host in db:
  runner.state.orchestrate:
    - args:
      - mods: orchestrate.register_host_in_db
      - pillar:
          data: {{ data|json }}
```

```
/etc/salt # more orchestrate/register_host_in_db.sls
  register host in db - {{ hostname }}:
    mysql_query.run:
      - database: db
      - query: |
          INSERT ...
```
