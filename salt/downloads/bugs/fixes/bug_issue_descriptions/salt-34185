### Description of Issue/Question

The "educated guess" that Salt makes when a new job is created includes minions even when we don't have cached data for said minions.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create and accept a key for a new minion.
   
   This mimics a minion whose key has been accepted but has not _yet_ checked in with the master to deliver its grains.
2. Watch the event bus.
3. Send a new job.
4. Observe the minion above is in the `minions` array in the job "new" event.
### Versions Report

2016.3 branch (3413c494bd59). Probably all currently supported releases as well.
### Detail

Send the command:

``` shell
% salt -G 'os_family:RedHat' test.ping
jerry:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

See the educated event in the event:

``` json
salt/job/20160621151018606834/new       {
    "_stamp": "2016-06-21T21:10:18.609144",
    "arg": [],
    "fun": "test.ping",
    "jid": "20160621151018606834",
    "minions": [
        "jerry"
    ],
    "tgt": "os_family:RedHat",
    "tgt_type": "grain",
    "user": "shouse"
}
```

Sanity check that we don't yet have grains for that minion:

``` shell
% salt-run cache.grains jerry
jerry:
    ----------
```
