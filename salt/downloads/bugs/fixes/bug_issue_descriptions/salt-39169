### Description of Issue/Question

When using `batch` with `salt.state` successful/all runs will be handled like failures.

This is caused because of `'retcode': 0` in `m_ret` being passed to `salt.utils.check_state_result` (in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0a8c7e451ba8910c5116017a4cfe91b41bef5c9d/salt/states/saltmod.py#L302-L306).
Since it's not a dict, it will trigger `ret` to be `False` (in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0a8c7e451ba8910c5116017a4cfe91b41bef5c9d/salt/utils/__init__.py#L1841-L1842).

Using `m_ret.pop('retcode')` before fixes it.

I could imagine also for `check_state_result` to look at `retcode` (if any), and use it to return based on that (i.e. `0` means success).

`salt.function` is not affected by this.  It looks at `retcode` (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/0a8c7e451ba8910c5116017a4cfe91b41bef5c9d/salt/states/saltmod.py#L474-L476), and does not use `check_state_result`.

### Setup

`stack.sls`:

```
test:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'G@environment:test and â€¦'
    - tgt_type: compound
    - sls:
      - docker
    - batch: 10%
```

```
salt-run state.orchestrate orchestration.stack saltenv=test
```
