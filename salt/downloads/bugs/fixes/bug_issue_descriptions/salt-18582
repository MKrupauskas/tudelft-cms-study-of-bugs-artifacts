Practical example:
- having STG environment file_roots and pillar_roots described in: /etc/salt/master.d/stg.conf
- having DEV environment file_roots and pillar_roots described in: /etc/salt/master.d/dev.conf
- inclusion of master.d/*.conf active in /etc/salt/master

Desired outcome:
- file_roots and pillar_roots would be included and merged from different files under master.d

Current outcome:
- arbitrary environment roots seem to take precedence - no other warnings/errors
