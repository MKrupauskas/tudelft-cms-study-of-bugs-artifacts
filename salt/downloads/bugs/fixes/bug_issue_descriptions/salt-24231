First off... **SALT IS AWESOME!** :grin: Secondly, I don't know where to post this, so if I'm in the wrong place, please redirect me. It took me a whole day to hunt this down, and I'm trying to help others as well as perhaps get a fix for this.

I tried using [npm.bootstrap](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.npm.html#salt.states.npm.bootstrap) on a node project that had an indirect reference to [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp), but the install process hung. I couldn't recover the machine and had to `vagrant halt` it. 

Here's what broke it:

``` sh
salt-ssh
 vagrant@127.0.0.1
     sudo
         npm install
             node node-gyp rebuild
                 su vagrant # <-- node-gyp doesn't like "sudo". Technically,
                     g++    # it's not su vagrant, but su $SSH_USER
```

``` yaml
# roster
shopper-vagrant:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  user: vagrant
  sudo: True # <-- NPM bootstraps as root, but node-gyp bails back to vagrant
  port: 2222
  priv: ../.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
```

The end result was to remove `SUDO_UID` and `SUDO_USER` from `ENV` before running it, per
[https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/issues/115#issuecomment-28490552]. Unfortunately, you can't use [environ.setenv](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.environ.html#salt.states.environ.setenv) for this, because the changes aren't picked up by `npm install`. I ended up using the following to fix it:

``` yaml
# project.sls
test-project:
  cmd.script:
    - name: salt://npm-hack/npm-bootstrap.sh
    - cwd : {{ project.path }}
    - user: {{ project.user }}
    - onchanges:
      - git: webfetch-shopper
```

``` sh
#!/bin/sh
# npm-bootstrap.sh

export SUDO_UID=$(id -u)
export SUDO_USER=

npm install
```

So... Is there any way we can make `npm.bootstrap` see if `user: foo` is set, and run an alternative version of npm install? If I'm in the right place, I might try writing a fix, as the script I wrote could have been as simple as:

``` sh
SUDO_UID=$(id -u) SUDO_USER="" npm install
```
