### Description of Issue
When using the `file.replace` state, the file's modification date is changed even if there is no changes.
An older issue was also reporting this issue : https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18841

This behavior is problematic when used on minions with a HIDS or any FIM.

A unit test for this problem : https://github.com/slaws/salt/blob/file-replace-idempotency/tests/unit/modules/test_file.py#L120

This commit seems to correct the problem : https://github.com/slaws/salt/commit/d85943e798fecb319bba2a6058690106b5cf3b1d

It does not seem to break the other tests, however I'm not sure this is the best way to correct it.
