### Description of Issue/Question

The module `beacons` has a list function which is supposed to show the list of beacons enabled. It does correctly display the ones enabled via the minion config but not the ones enabled via pillar configuration.

The beacons are active and work correctly though.

The module fires an event which is handled in the minion event loop, which takes `self.opts['beacons']` and sends it back as an event to the module. I think this data does not include the beacons configured to the pillar. I can try to propose a patch with some guidance on how this should work and if it is expected.
### Setup

I used https://github.com/dmacvicar/salt-opensuse-playground and a SUSE Manager server and added beacons in different combinations.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Configure some beacons.
- One from minion config
- One from /srv/pillar
- One from a custom ext_pillar

Then executed `salt minion1 beacons.list`. Only the one from the minion configuration appears.
