Hi,
I have just tested 2014.7.1 (Helium) on Ubuntu and discovered some more issues with forced remount... patch follows...

The following issues I have discovered so far:
- If the mount proto (e.g., udp, tcp) is specified without the proto=tcp or proto=udo option, that it is not detected correctly. Hence, that option has to be really specified with proto=XX
- Option nointr is not part of mount_invisible_options...
