Using Salt from the latest on the develop branch:

```
test-etc-hosts-blockreplace-services:                                           
  file.blockreplace:                                                            
    - name: c:\temp\test-blockreplace.txt                                       
    - marker_start: "# BLOCK TOP : salt managed zone : local services : please do not edit"
    - marker_end: "# BLOCK BOTTOM : end of salt managed zone --"                
    - content: |                                                                
        127.0.0.1 db.local.net                                                  
        127.0.0.1 http.local.net                                                
        127.0.0.1 foo bar foo.local.net bar.local.net                           
        127.0.0.1 foobar # with a comment                                       
    - show_changes: True                                                        
    - append_if_not_found: True
```

This results in the start marker, then end marker and all the lines of the `content` appearing to be on the same line because posix line endings are used instead of windows line endings.
