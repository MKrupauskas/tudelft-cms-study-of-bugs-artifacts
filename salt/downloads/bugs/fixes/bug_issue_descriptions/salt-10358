I found a bug in the check_ip function in the dig.py file. The regular expression for ipv6 is returning false for a valid IP address. I wrote some tests for it in dig_test.py that have been disabled. See #10357 for the tests in question. They are currently disabled but can be re-enabled to debug this issue.

The first disabled test is here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/tests/unit/modules/dig_test.py#L22

And the second one is here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/tests/unit/modules/dig_test.py#L50
