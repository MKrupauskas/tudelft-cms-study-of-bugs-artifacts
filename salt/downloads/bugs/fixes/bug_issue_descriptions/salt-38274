### Description of Issue/Question
When attempting to spin up any number of EC2 instances with salt-cloud, the following error is being thrown:

`[Error  ] There was a query error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'`

The same provider/profile/map files work fine using 2016.3.4

### Setup

See attachments for profiles/providers/map 
[cloud_details.zip](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/files/655101/cloud_details.zip)

Place cloud.profiles into /etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d
Place cloud.providers into /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d
Place cloud.map anywhere on filesystem

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Command:
sudo salt-cloud --map /path/to/map/cloud.map -y

Below is the result from salt-cloud command:

I noticed that when this line:

`if 'Ebs.VolumeType' not in ex_blockdevicemappings[dev_index]:`

in salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py (line 1891) was changed to this:

`if rd_type is not None:`

Everything worked as intended.  The latter code snippet is from 2016.3.4.
