If "salt-ssh * -l all -r" is incorrect it should print out an error to the user. 

Right now I'm getting an unresponsive shell, ctrl-c doesn't work, process goes 100% CPU and after killing it from another shell I get weird behaviour with the keyboard (some keystrockes get lost somewhere, in a rather random fashion, reset is not enough to get back to a normal situation).
