**Description**
I got a problem when using salt on openEuler linux(both master and minion), which is an opensource linux system and uses rpm for pkg management & systemd for service management, like what Centos do.

It reports an error as ”State 'pkg.installed' was not found”. I guess it's because openEuler systems can not be recognized, while it's very similar to Centos or fedora. So is there some way I can tell salt that the system is centos-like, or that rpm and systemd are used on this system? 

Or maybe this can be fixed? I really like Salt because it's arch independent and has detailed  documents so that I can easily manage my systems.

**Setup**
```
top.sls
base:
  '*':
     - system
```

```
system.sls
auditd:
    pkg.installed: []
    service.running:
        - require:
            - pkg: audit

```
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
$ salt '*' state.apply
m1:
    ----------
    pkg_|-auditd_|-auditd_|-installed:
        ----------
        __run_num__:
            0
        changes:
            ----------

            **State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'system'**
            **Reason: Module 'pkg' is not available.**
        name:
            auditd
        result:
            False
    service_|-auditd_|-auditd_|-running:
        ----------
        __run_num__:
            1
        __sls__:
            system
        changes:
