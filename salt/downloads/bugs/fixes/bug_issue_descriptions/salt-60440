**Description**
While testing the failover feature with multi-master, we found that some master IPs disappeared in the list of masters decreased in minion log, and minon cannot switch over to other normal master for more than 3 hours.

**Setup**
Regular salt master - minion setup

Minion configuration
```yaml
master:
  - 71.15.94.58
  - 71.15.94.152
  - 71.15.94.153
master_type: failover
master_failback: False
master_alive_interval: 60
random_master: True
retry_dns: 0
loop_interval: 1
ping_interval: 5
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. shutdown master1(71.15.94.58) VM forever
2. restart master2(71.15.94.152) and hold on 5mins and restart master3(71.15.94.153)
3. wait master2/3 back to normal and check the list of masters in minon log
4. check minon switch over to  master2/3 or not

**Expected behavior**
Minon should switch over to master2/3 in minutes.
