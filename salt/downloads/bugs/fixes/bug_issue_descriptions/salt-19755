Missing python-dateutil. Ignoring job <jobname>.
You get this error if python-dateutil isnt installed on a minion that has a schedule like this : 

```
schedule:
  restart-minion:
    function: service.restart
    args:
      - salt-minion
    splay: 15
    when:
      - Monday 10:00am
      - Tuesday 10:00am
      - Wednesday 10:00am
      - Thursday 11:51am
```

Maybe python-dateutil should be a dependency somewhere?
