This may be an salt-minion upgrade fluke, but I got this when I upgraded a minion with itself:

```
    State: - sysctl
    Name:      vm.swappiness
    Function:  present
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1239, in call
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/sysctl.py", line 55, in present
    current = __salt__['sysctl.show']()
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/linux_sysctl.py", line 78, in show
    for line in __salt__['cmd.run_stdout'](cmd).splitlines():

    reset_system_locale=reset_system_locale)["stdout"]

    proc = salt.utils.timed_subprocess.TimedProc(cmd, **kwargs)

    self.stdin = self.stdin.replace('\\n', '\n')
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'with_communicate'

        Changes:
```

(And a whole lot other state errors that look just like this). Is this parallel processing at work?

If so, can I make a state "special" so that it runs alone? 

```
pkg.latest:
  - name: salt-minion
```

would get that treatment...
