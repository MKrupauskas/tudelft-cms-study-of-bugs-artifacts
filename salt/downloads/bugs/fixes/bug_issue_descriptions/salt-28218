Previously a package we have installed successfully, but recently it fails with a vague message about the registry. While the state fails, the package gets installed anyway, and if I log the install process it shows no errors.  When I check the box manually I see the package is installed, and everything looks normal.

Regardless, the package does not show up in pkg.list_pkgs() and I think this is part of the problem.  Recently I see there was some changes to the win_pkg.py in 2015.8 that added `ret['_comment']='Registry not updated.'`
which I am seeing in the output.  I dont know why the package is not getting picked up in `list_pkgs()`, even though I can see it makes a entry in the registry, but I am going to keep looking.  

If someone who knows more about the win_pkg module could lend some assistance it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

UPDATE:
This may be more serious than I thought.  I did not notice at first, but `list_pkgs()` is not returning other 64 bit software like the java runtime or vmware tools.  
I went through the win_pkg module and found that `_get_reg_software()` is not returning 64bit entries: https://gist.github.com/rmarcinik/295b10d4ec2c367897f8

It seems to me that `win32api.RegEnumKeyEx()` is busted because it is returning the same result with two different `reg_handle` values
