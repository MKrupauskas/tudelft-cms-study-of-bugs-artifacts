### Setup

The line on which we attempt to start the service is at https://github.com/servo/saltfs/blob/master/buildbot/slave/init.sls#L61, and the rest of our configs and setup are in that repo. Our initial mac setup song and dance is documented at https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/SaltStack-Administration#osx

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Attempt to apply, to an OSX 10.11.6 minion, a state including service.running. Specific error is above.

### Other comments

I see the path to the overrides.plist hardcoded in Salt at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/413de95df2a4cf81575bb654f3e51fc1c52b112a/salt/modules/launchctl.py#L336, however http://www.launchd.info/ says that "Starting with OSX 10.10 Yosemite the override database was moved to a different location. ". This leads me to suspect that my issue may be a result of incompatibility between Salt and my OSX version, so I'm filing it here to get find out whether Salt is working correctly on OSX 10.11.x for anyone else.
