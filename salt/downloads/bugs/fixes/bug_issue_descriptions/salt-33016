### Description of Issue/Question

I ran a simple `salt-run cache.clear_all` command and saw an error in the system that I'm unsure if has unwanted effects.

It seems that the RAET transport isn't quite baked yet with all the side issues I've seen. Is anyone actually using RAET?
### Setup

Configure master/mininos to use RAET as the transport on Ubuntu 14.04.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Once setup execute a cache clean_all salt run.

```

    self.stack.transmit(msg, self.stack.nameRemotes[self.ryn].uid)
KeyError: 'manor'
```

I wager this is not specific to the cache.clear_all functionality but to other salt run calls when using RAET.
