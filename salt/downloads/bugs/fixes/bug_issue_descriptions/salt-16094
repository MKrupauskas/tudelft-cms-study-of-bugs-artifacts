I would like to see custom command output from salt in my Graphite. 
For example this works perfectly:
salt '*' status.cpuinfo --return carbon

But this does not:
 salt '*' status.w --return carbon

In the end what is really interesting me is how i can make this show up in Graphite:
salt-call  cmd.run 'grep VERSION_ID /etc/os-release | sed s/\"//g  | sed s/=/:\n\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ /' --return carbon

Thanks for any hints/tips!
