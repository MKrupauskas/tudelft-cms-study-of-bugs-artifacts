I tried using the iptables.append, which does work correctly. Unfortunately with many existing rules, it takes minutes to complete.

I've got 6577 entries (almost all of them in the form "-s x.y.z.w/24 -j DROP") at the moment and each iptables state results in the output of iptables-save and then salt-minion hanging for a minute with 100% CPU usage.

Running on ubuntu 14.04 / local salt 2014.1.13
