In the current release v2014.1.6 the 'salt -b' batch command on the master ist not working anymore

```
# salt '*' -b 2 test.ping
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

```

The problem seem to be:
In the _develop_ branch there is a change in `salt/client/__init__.py` from the method `LocalConfig` to `get_local_config`. This is not yet merged into release _v2014.1.6_. 

Somehow it has already been changed in the file `salt/cli/batch.py`. For the release there it should be reverted to the use of `LocalConfig`.
