### Description of Issue/Question
I am using https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.archive.html to download and extract archives from a HTTP server. This server requires authentication, and I embed credentials into URL. On success, salt puts the whole URL, including the password, into the comment field.

I wonder if it would be possible to strip the password, like it's done e.g. in eae3a435dd33d3c796e8a128b26e56b4e3fcc6e3?
