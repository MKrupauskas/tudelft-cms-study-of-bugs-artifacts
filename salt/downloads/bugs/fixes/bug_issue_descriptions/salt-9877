I see that [the execution module for s3](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.s3.html#module-salt.modules.s3) will reference the configuration value `s3.service_url`. The S3 fileserver backend, however, doesn't do this. I set the value in my Master config but the logs show that it's fetching files from the default `s3.amazonaws.com`. 

I've tested this ability (reading `s3.service_url`) with the s3 execution module via an `s3.get` on the command line and it worked great. Any chance we can see the same in the fileserver backend?

Looking at the code, it seems that `salt.utils.s3.query()` supports a `requesturl` parameter, but `salt.fileserver.s3fs` isn't making use of it (see the two calls to `s3.query` in `s3fs.py`).

Would it be as simple as checking for `s3.service_url` and, if present, providing that as the value to `requesturl`? Or do I misunderstand?
