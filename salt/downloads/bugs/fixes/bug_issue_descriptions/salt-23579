If you use `state.show_lowstate` in a state (either direct or indirect via a module) this results in an infinite loop which always executes until it reaches the point which does the actual call to `state.show_lowstate` and then proceeds with `Loading fresh modules for state activity`.

I am trying to use this to determine the contents of the state to include additional states based on that but it doesn't even get this far since it will loop immediately when it encounters a `state.show_lowstate`.
