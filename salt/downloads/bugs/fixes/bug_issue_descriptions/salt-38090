### Description of Issue/Question

With the following state file
```
install:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: some-packagename
    - refresh: True
```

both salt-ssh, and regular salt fail to call `apt-get update` (I'm expecting it to be called, based on https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.pkg.html#salt.states.pkg.installed) on an Ubuntu system (really doubt this is ubuntu-specific, though). This is deduced by me simply by looking at `/var/cache/apt/lists`, and noting that no new files are created for a new repo I've got in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` (running `apt-get update` manually creates these files though).

### Setup

See SLS file above (the `- refresh: True` line can be removed as well, and the effect will still be the same). Create any valid file in `/var/lib/apt/sources.list.d`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

See description above.
