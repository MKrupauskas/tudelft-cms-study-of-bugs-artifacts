```
$ salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2015.5.3 (Lithium)
$ ls -l /var/cache/salt/minion/highstate.cache.p
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5215 Oct 28 19:53 /var/cache/salt/minion/highstate.cache.p
$ strings /var/cache/salt/minion/highstate.cache.p
user
<username>
password
<password hash>
```

Secrets get dumped in highstate.cache.p, which is world readable.  It looks like this has been fixed before, so this is probably a regression.  See https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/6764 for a past instance of this.

This also appears in 2015.8.1:

```
vagrant@vm:~$ salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2015.8.1 (Beryllium)
vagrant@vm:~$ ls -l /var/cache/salt/minion/highstate.cache.p
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2539 Oct 29 21:32 /var/cache/salt/minion/highstate.cache.p
```
