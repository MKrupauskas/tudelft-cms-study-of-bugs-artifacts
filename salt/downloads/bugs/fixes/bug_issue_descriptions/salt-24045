I've been running a salt sls using a salt-ssh and `npm.bootstrap` always errors out with:

``` sh
Error Bootstrapping '/var/www/...':
```

If I check on the server, I see that the `npm.installed` succeeded.

I tried debugging the issue by editing the `npm.py` module and state files, but it seems that salt-ssh acts as if I haven't changed anything (Is there some kind of cache active?)

I'm proposing that this might be a bug.

Tried this on both v2014.7.1_1 and v2015.5.0.
