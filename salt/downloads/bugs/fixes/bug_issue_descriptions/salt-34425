### Description of Issue/Question

When trying to run something like `salt * sys.doc <anything> --out=json` I do not get json. Doesn't seem to be working with other outputters either
### Setup

Have a minion and a master.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt minion1 sys.doc test.ping --out=json
"test.ping:"

    Used to make sure the minion is up and responding. Not an ICMP ping.

    Returns ``True``.

    CLI Example:

        salt '*' test.ping
```

`salt-call` on the minion works:

```
salt-call sys.doc test.ping --out=json
{
    "local": {
        "test.ping": "\n    Used to make sure the minion is up and responding. Not an ICMP ping.\n\n    Returns ``True``.\n\n    CLI Example:\n\n        salt '*' test.ping\n    "
    }
}
```
