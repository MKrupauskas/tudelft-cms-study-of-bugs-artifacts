If you use `dockerng.running` and change the `entrypoint` for your Docker container, then the state reports the diff in a very odd format. It looks like each item in the entrypoint is sorted alphabetically and that is chosen. This is jarring because the `entrypoint` key takes in a list of various command line arguments/flags that are joined together in the order they are specified in.

Here is the entrypoint we are using: 

```
app-worker:
  dockerng.running:
    - image: company/app:{{ pillar['sw2.appenv'] }}
    - network_mode: host
    - entrypoint:
      - celery
      - -A
      - application.celery_app
      - worker
      - --loglevel=info
      - --autoscale={{- pillar['app.worker.max_procs'] -}},{{-
                        pillar['app.worker.min_procs'] -}}
      - -n
      - worker
    - environment:
      - APP_PORT: "{{ 5000 }}"
      - WORKER_COUNT: "1"
      - REDIS_HOST: localhost
      - CELERYD_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD: "100"
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_HOST: localhost
      - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: password
      - MYSQL_DEFAULT_HOST: localhost
      - MYSQL_DEFAULT_USER: user
      - MYSQL_DEFAULT_PASS: password
      - DATABASE_PORT: "3306"
```

And whenever we change something in the entrypoint, the diff we get resembles:

```

What I expect to be printed out:

```

I expect this because that is the order in which I defined my entrypoint pieces. It's also relevant because the order in which I pass my arguments to my entrypoint command generally matters, and this causes confusion (and a bit of terror as I fear my deploy is broken!).

Thanks in advance!
