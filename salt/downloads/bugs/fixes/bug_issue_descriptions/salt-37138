### Description of Issue/Question

Using an spm repository hosted on a web server, the install command retrieves the spm file but doesn't save it in the spm cache dir for installation.
### Setup

Setup a SPM repository at `/etc/salt/spm.repos.d/my.repo` pointing to a remote http repository:

``` yaml
myrepo:
  url: http://myrepo.example.com/
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Update the remote repository: `spm update_repo` (see also #37095)
Install a spm from the remote repository: 

```
# ./spm -ldebug install mypkg
