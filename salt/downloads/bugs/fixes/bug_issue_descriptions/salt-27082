When I run a `salt-run winrepo.genrepo` I get three lines of error before any of the expected output:

```
[ERROR   ] Rendering exception occurred :Jinja variable 'dict' object has no attribute 'os'
```

`salt-run -l debug winrepo.genrepo 2>&1 | nl | less` and searching for 'Rendering exception occurred', gives the following blocks. 

```
     1  [DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/master

@UtahDave ^^ is that "old" 'wmi_provider/init.sls', needing another look, now that we have jinja2 templating support in winrepo?
