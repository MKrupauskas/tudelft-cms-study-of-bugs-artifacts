### Description of Issue/Question
`salt.modules.yumpkg.refresh_db` can hang indefinitely if there is an repository signing key that has not yet been accepted on the system. This happens because the yum/dnf utility prompts the user to confirm importing the key, and the Salt Minion will hang because there is no way to respond to the prompt.

### Setup
Create a new YUM repository configuration in /etc/yum.repos.d that has a package signing key and has not yet been accepted on the system.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run `salt-call -l pkg.refresh_db`

The log output will run to this point and hang:
```
[INFO    ] Executing command ['dnf', '--quiet', 'check-update'] in directory '/root'
```
Running the same command by hand will reveal that yum/dnf is waiting for user confirmation.
