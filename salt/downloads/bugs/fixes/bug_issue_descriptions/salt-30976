The documentation [as seen in salt/modules/s3.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/ef02779391e1ee39890ce92a0eb41babdaa699c4/salt/modules/s3.py#L47) states that `s3.location` defaults to `us-east-1`. My experience is that this is not presently the case and I have to specify this value in order for `s3.get` to work.

Further corroborating this claim is [the unit test I've added](https://github.com/timcharper/salt/blob/2015.8/tests/unit/modules/s3_test.py#L39) for `salt/modules/s3.py`, `_get_key` method.

Is that default supposed to be injected somewhere else? Or is it expected that `_get_key` provides the default?
