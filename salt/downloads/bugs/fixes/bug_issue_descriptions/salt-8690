I scratched my head for 15 minutes on this one:

I have a couple of custom grains defined under /etc/salt/grains

They wouldn't load for some reason

It occurs I had a typo in the file.. something like this:

```
COMPANY_GRAIN1: blah
COMPANY_GRAIN2:bleh
COMPANY_GRAIN3: lolz
```

Notice the missing space on COMPANY_GRAIN2?

The whole file was discarded silently even when running `salt-minion -l debug`. I would expect logs to report the syntax error.
