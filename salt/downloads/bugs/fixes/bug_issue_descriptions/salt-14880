Greetings, 

I managed to get vsphere working correctly using the sample provider conf on the documentation provided at: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.html

I'm using the latest dev version:

```
root@sdlcmaster001:/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d# salt-master --version
salt-master 2014.7.0-405-g7cdaa50 (Helium)
root@sdlcmaster001:/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d# salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2014.7.0-405-g7cdaa50 (Helium)
root@sdlcmaster001:/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d# salt-cloud --version
salt-cloud 2014.7.0-405-g7cdaa50 (Helium)
```

Using the command "salt-cloud -f list_hosts vsphere" works, and returns a list of hosts, as expected:

```
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
my-vsphere-config:
    ----------
    vsphere:
        ----------
        ha-host:
            localhost.localdomain
```

However, the function list_nodes (http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.html#salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.list_nodes) does not:

```
salt-cloud -f list_nodes vsphere
[ERROR   ] There was an error running the function: list_nodes() takes no arguments (1 given)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 221, in run
    self.function_provider, self.function_name, kwargs
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1407, in do_function
    driver: self.clouds[fun](call='function')
TypeError: list_nodes() takes no arguments (1 given)
```

It seems to use the function name, I have to use the -f switch, however it won't work if you don't pass any arguments. 

This also seems to affect:

```
salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.list_nodes_full
salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.list_nodes_min
salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.list_nodes_select
```

Finally, would it be possible to have a sample vm profile for the create function?: 

http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.html#salt.cloud.clouds.vsphere.create

I did a feeble attempt to get this to work by creating a profile: 

vspheremac.conf

```
my-mac-vm:
  provider: vsphere
  image: 'https://192.168.1.16/folder/isos/macvm001.ova?dcPath=ha%2ddatacenter&dsName=datastore1'
  script: bootstrap-salt
  minion:
    master: 192.168.1.17
    size:
      cpus: 1
      ram: 2048
  ssh_username: root
  ssh_password: redacted
```

However, if I try and create the vm I get: 

```
salt-cloud -p my-mac-vm -l debug

```

I can also assist with the documentation if educated on some of these points. I've been online in the irc channel (@ingwaem) for a number of days trying to get through these issues, however seems not many other people have been using this module yet so I'm completely stumped at the moment. I'm super excited it's here though!
