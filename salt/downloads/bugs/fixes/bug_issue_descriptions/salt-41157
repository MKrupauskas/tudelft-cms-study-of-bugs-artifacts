### Description of Issue/Question
When using `salt-run` to execute a `runner` it is missing the `success` field in the underlying data, so when using a returner such as `mysql` the `success` field is always *False*.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just inspect the underlying data of any job ran using `salt-run`. Example below ...

```json
{"jid": "20170509175512338982", "return": {"fun_args": [], "jid": "20170509175512338982", "return": {"wheel": [], "utils": [], "engines": [], "grains": [], "tops": [], "queues": [], "returners": [], "modules": [], "renderers": [], "states": [], "proxymodules": [], "output": [], "pillar": [], "runners": ["runners.vault"]}, "success": true, "_stamp": "2017-05-09T17:55:15.326927", "user": "root", "fun": "runner.saltutil.sync_all"}, "user": "root", "tgt": "mgt-slt-001", "fun": "runner.saltutil.sync_all", "id": "mgt-slt-001"}
```

If you inspect the json, you will see there is a `success` inside the return object, but not on the top level object and specifically on the mysql returner it's looking for a `success` entry on the top level dictionary.

At quick glance a few things refer to `success` sqlite3, sms, mysql returners, I'm sure there are others.
