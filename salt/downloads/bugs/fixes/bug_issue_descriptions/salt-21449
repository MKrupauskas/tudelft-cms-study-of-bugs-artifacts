Using the following contents in master config file, 

```
mysql.host: 'IP of remote db'
mysql.user: 'myuser'
mysql.pass: 'mypass'
mysql.db: 'mydb'
mysql.port: 3306
master_job_cache: mysql
event_return: mysql
```

if db is not available test.ping will fail with the following:

```
# salt '*' test.ping
[ERROR   ] Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased.
Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

master log file contents:

```
2015-03-09 14:55:04,179 [salt.client      ][WARNING ][7215] Returner unavailable: MySQL returner could not connect to 
database: (1045, "Access denied for user 'user'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")
```

if master_job_cache and event_return entries are remarked in master config then operation will continue normally.
