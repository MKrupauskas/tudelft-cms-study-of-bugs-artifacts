this is the state file

```
monitoring_for_openstack:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /opt/

    - if_missing: /opt/monitoring-for-openstack/
    - keep: True
```

tar file is downloaded ok, if i manually go to the minion and cd /opt/ i can extract the file doing tar xxj -f /var/cache/salt/minion/files/base/_opt_monitoring-for-openstack_.tar

this worked before,  2014.7.0 and 2014.1
