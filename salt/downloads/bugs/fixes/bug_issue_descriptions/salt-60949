**Description**
As we have learned from the past, it's a good thing to keep the salt master up to date because there is a CVE scored 9+ ~once a year. The docs says that this should be done by regularly running a `sudo apt-get install salt-master` followed by a service restart. Unfortunately, this is not the whole story, due to config file conflicts.

**Setup**
Salt-Master on Ubuntu 18

Please be as specific as possible and give set-up details.

- [ X] on-prem machine
- [ ] VM (Virtualbox, KVM, etc. please specify)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD

  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
- Run `sudo apt-get install salt-master` on a machine
- Wait until a new version got released
- Run `sudo apt-get install salt-master` again to fetch the update

**Expected behavior**
Update should succeed without a manual review of the config file. Or the docs should describe an alternate solution.

**Actual behavior**
```
Setting up salt-master (3003.3+ds-1) ...

Configuration file '/etc/salt/master'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** master (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
```

This will result in numberous salt masters in the wild that are not up-date and potentially vulnerable. I have seen that several times now (different version updates).


PS:
Additionally, there are availablity / reachability problems with the Release file:
