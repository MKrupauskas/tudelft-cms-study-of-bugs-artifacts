I'm using `salt-ssh` to provision a RHEL 6.6 machine with my high state and receiving tracebacks when performing operations that require HTTPS, such as package installation from a source or files being managed with a HTTPS source. 

One traceback for package install looked like this:

```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

```

The error is the same as kennethreitz/requests#557 but the cause is the missing/incorrect path to the root CA file.  The cause is that the `requests/certs.py` file delivered to the target machine (RHEL 6.6) references `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` as the preferred cert bundle.  This path doesn't exist, and should in fact be `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` (confirmed for CentOS 6.5 and RHEL 6.6).   Manually correcting this Python file on the target fixes the problem.

I initially thought this issue was requests' fault, but their stock code in `certs.py` differs from what's delivered in `/tmp/.root_...__salt/requests/cert.py` on my machine, which indicates Salt is changing this path?  I'm clearly not `grep`ping for the right strings as I can't seem to find where this happens in Salt.

This wasn't an issue recently, so perhaps this is a regression on the `2014.7` branch (I've been keeping up with changes for `salt-ssh`).
