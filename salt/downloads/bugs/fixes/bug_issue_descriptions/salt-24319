In certain circumstances, the state functions `grains.append` and `grains.list_absent` fail silently (with succeed result), without error, and without change.
- `list_absent`: trying to remove an element from a grain that's not a list do nothing, succeeds with this comment: Grain `foo` is not a valid list.
- `append`:
  - appending to an existing grain that's not a list, without convert, succeeds, without change and with this comment: Grain `foo` is not a valid list
  - appending to a non existent grain succeeds, without change and with this comment: Grain `foo` does not exist

For all these cases, I think the right thing to do is failing the state. This way, one can know that the grain didn't change.

PS: is there a better place to discuss a state existing behavior or a proposed behavior?
