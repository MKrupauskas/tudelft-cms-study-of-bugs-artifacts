**Description**

Xen Paravirtualized VMs have an `os/kernel` element like the following:

```
  <os>
    <type arch='x86_64'>linux</type>
    <kernel>/usr/lib/grub2/x86_64-xen/grub.xen</kernel>
  </os>
```

When running `virt.update` with `boot=None` which is the default, the kernel element is removed instead of being left untouched.
