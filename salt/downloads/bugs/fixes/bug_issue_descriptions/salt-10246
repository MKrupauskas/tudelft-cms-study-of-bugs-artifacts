If you have problems installing SaltStack on your Mac OSX with homebrew
if you have any ideas how to resolve these issues differently I'd like to know. tnx
## 

having followed the instructions found on the official manual
         https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/salt/latest/salt.pdf
and doing
          brew install saltstack

you may run into the issue that it fails silently
Error: "No available formula for saltstack"

so to see the problem doing brew install -vd saltstack
      /usr/local/Library/brew.rb: loading /usr/local/Library/Formula/saltstack.rb
      Error: no such file to load -- /usr/local/Library/Formula/saltstack.rb
      Please report this bug:
           https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting
      ...

following instructtions on https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting we do these to see the problem with homebrew itself
       sudo brew update
            unable to unlink old 'share/man/man1/brew.1' (Permission denied)
            see ref *1 for unlinking problems on bottom
            at this stage i didn't try again to update brew and did next step

```
   sudo brew doctor
         i found something in brew doctor that there aren't developer tools installed
              xcode-select --install
         although i have xcode these dev tools were missing.
```

so, doing again 
       brew install -vd saltstack 

```
  it fails somewhere in pcre, swig, zeromg and you may need to do manually the link
  before you can try again with saltstack (see ref *1 for linking problems)
        sudo brew link --overwrite pcre
        sudo brew link --overwrite swig
        sudo brew link --overwrite zeromq
        sudo brew link --overwrite saltstack
```

check the brew
            brew info saltstack 
                    now shows alls deps are installed

*1 linking problems
       if you have linking/unlinking problems also you may need to do 
             chown -v root /usr/local/bin/brew
       which is not supported but i found it impossible to do the brew linking without it
