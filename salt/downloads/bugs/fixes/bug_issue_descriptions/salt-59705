**Description**
On a newly updated to 3002.5 salt master trying to install a specific version of salt-minion to the centos minions now returns an error. Regression? Pretty sure this worked before 3002.5?  

**Setup**
on a centos 8 salt master with a new upgrade to version 3002.5 trying to deploy the latest salt-minion to centos Linux minions. 

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```salt 'mycentosminion1' pkg.install salt-minion version=3002.5```

now on newly upgraded salt master3002.5 gives the following error:
```
File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/yumpkg.py", line 1521, in install
        version_num = version_num.lstrip("=")
    AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'lstrip'
```

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Versions Report**

(Provided by running salt --versions-report. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)

**Additional context**
Here is me trying to see if single quoting the version number helps, but it does not. But on the other hand trying to upgrade the minions on windows still works.
