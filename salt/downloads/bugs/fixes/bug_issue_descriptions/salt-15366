Hi. Fairly often, there are multiple names for a given device, in Linux at least. For example, a logical volume can be either /dev/vgname/lvname or /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname. It'd be nice if the various commands that dealt with device files could recognize if two file names are the same device or not (at least to some extent) and deal with this in a way that makes sense.

Presently, for example, if I ask for a "mount.mounted" via a /dev/vgname/lvname device but fstab is using /dev/mapper/vgname-lvname, the command just fails. Which I don't think is the right thing to do in this case... Thanks for reading!
