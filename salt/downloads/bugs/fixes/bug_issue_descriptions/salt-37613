### Description of Issue/Question

While the binary exists for SPARC Solaris, the command is essentially useless.  The following error is reported within 'grains.items':
```
smbios: failed to load SMBIOS: No such file or directory
```

From the binary (/usr/sbin/smbios):
```
smbios: failed to load SMBIOS: System does not export an SMBIOS table
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On a SPARC Solaris system:
```
salt-call grains.items
```
```
/usr/sbin/smbios
```
