Tornado 5.0 is currently in beta, and I'm filing issues with prominent
users of Tornado to give them a chance to test it before release and
provide feedback on the changes and make adjustments as necessary. You
can install it with `pip install --pre tornado==5.0b1`. I expect to
release the final version of Tornado 5.0 in early March, about a month
away.

Full release notes are
[here](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/latest/releases/v5.0.0.html). The
major change is that the `IOLoop` is now always backed by `asyncio` on
Python 3, which leads to various subtle changes at runtime but is
mostly compatible with previous versions. A more superficial but
source-incompatible change is that the `io_loop` argument to many
functions in Tornado has been removed and `IOLoop.current()` must be
used instead.

If you've already tested with Tornado 5.0b1 (or temporarily pinned
your dependency to 4.x so you can postpone dealing with this), feel
free to close this issue.
