If I build an image, for example: private.registry.io/saltstack/ubuntu:2014.1.10 and never use the "latest" tag, docker.push will not work. It assumes you are looking for the "latest" because docker.push doesn't take a tag argument. If you try and append a tag :2014.1.10 you'll get an error about an invalid repo name.

I looked over the code and an easy solution didn't present itself to me, but this is a bad bug IMO. I don't use latest tag at all to prevent accidental deployments of code that isn't ready for release. I use tags like prod, qa, dev, and version numbers, but I can't build and push them with saltstack at the moment due to this bug unless I am missing something.
