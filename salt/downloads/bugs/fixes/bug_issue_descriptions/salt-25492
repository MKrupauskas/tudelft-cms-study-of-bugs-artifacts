Hello,
I'm trying to set up a Docker container in a Minion and getting this error on docker.installed

```
Comment: We did not get any expected answer from docker
              Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/dockerio.py", line 640, in create_container
                  cpuset=cpuset
                File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/client.py", line 237, in create_container
                  volume_driver
                File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/docker/utils/utils.py", line 546, in create_container_config
                  'mem_limit has been moved to host_config in API version 1.19'
              InvalidVersion: mem_limit has been moved to host_config in API version 1.19
```

The error is being triggered in https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docker/utils/utils.py#L544

```
        if mem_limit is not None:
            raise errors.InvalidVersion(
                'mem_limit has been moved to host_config in API version 1.19'
            )
```

So I got around it by adding "mem_limit: !!null" to my docker.installed:

```
app-container:
  docker.installed:
    ...
    - mem_limit: !!null
```

However, it'd be great to have this fixed. Thanks!

The minion has docker-py==1.3.0 installed and this is my master's versions report
