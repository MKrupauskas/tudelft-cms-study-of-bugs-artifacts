salt 2015.5.3 (Lithium)

There seems to be a line that is referencing the mongo.user attribute as mongo.username, which causes the returner to default to logging without username and leads to permission issues.

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners/mongo_future_return.py
Ran into two issues when using the mongo returner:
_get_options (line 100) attempts to grab username attribute, but it's supposed to be (and reference everywhere) as user.

Changing the attribute username to user fixes issue with permissions (not authorized to create index, etc...).

Also - minor issue, but getting deprecation warnings for the 3 uses of ensure_index method (lines 142-145). Changing it to create_index resolves this.
