Using the python API

## 

Using the python api running.

``` python
saltCaller.function('grains.append', 'roles', 'master')
```

then immediately

``` python
saltCaller.function('state.highstate')
```

Highstate doesn't see the newly appended grain.  If highstate is run again after a few seconds or after a sync it sees the grain.  The previous behavior in 2014 always grabbed grains when running highstate.
