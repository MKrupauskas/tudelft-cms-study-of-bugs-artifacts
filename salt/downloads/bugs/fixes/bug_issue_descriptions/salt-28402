Hello,

I have faced an output issue.
I've tried different values for config and CLI option, but it seems that CLI option don't even tries to apply.

```
# salt --state-output=full -b 1 'master.server.com' state.sls common.repos.nginx

Executing run on ['master.server.com']

[ERROR   ] Invalid outputter mixed specified, fall back to nested
```

My config entries in master:

```
output: mixed
state_output: mixed
```

Version report:

```
