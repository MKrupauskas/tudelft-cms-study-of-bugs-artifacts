I noticed that services don't get disabled if they are in "manual" state and not running, using, example:

``` sls
dmwappushservice:
    service.disabled
```

I had to adjust my state as follows for desired results, which modifies the registry first putting it in disabled state (unless service doesn't exist on system) , then stopping the service if running (because I don't think service.disabled did that as well), and then disabling the service.  I'm ok with this, because it works, but its just not as clean as the above, maybe the module can be modified?  Thanks!

``` sls
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dmwappushservice:
  reg.present:
    - vname: Start
    - vdata: 4
    - vtype: REG_DWORD
    - unless:
      - 'sc query dmwappushservice | find "does not exist" >nul'
service_dmwappushservice:
  service.dead:
   - name: dmwappushservice
   - onchanges:
        - reg: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dmwappushservice
dmwappushservice:
    service.disabled:
      - onchanges:
        - reg: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dmwappushservice
```
