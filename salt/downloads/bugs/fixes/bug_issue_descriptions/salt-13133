I read the following from http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.openstack.html

It is not clear how to use the keyring in place of the plain text password option. 
Currently i have the following:

```
user: test
password: letmein
```

I want to use the keyring in place of the plain text. From what i understood, 
I first have to do this: 
`salt-cloud --set-password=test my-openstack-keyring-config password: USE_KEYRING`

After i did this, I got the following error message:

```
[root@salt-mom ~]# salt-cloud --set-password=test my-openstack-keyring-config password: USE_KEYRING
Usage: salt-cloud

salt-cloud: error: no such option: --set-password
```

Can the documentation be made more clear? It would be better to put an example of a case that uses keyring instead of plain text password.
