### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
```sls
# test.sls
/opt/ubuntu-14.04-x64-mini.iso:
  file.managed:
    - source: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso
    - source_hash: sha256=bc09966b54f91f62c3c41fc14b76f2baa4cce48595ce22e8c9f24ab21ac8d965
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the salt state above, multiple times. The file is downloaded fresh every single time, despite the hash already being correct in both the destination and the salt minion cache.

This was not the behavior in 2016.11.2. This regression was introduced in 8453800.
