This module needs tests. Someone has modified it without calling any of the functions, because they are all broken in a few ways. Specifically there's an issue with calling the functions with a user but no env (env is None but it gets update called on it). It also has an issue with calling cmd.run with env set, since "from **future** import unicode_literals" was added, which makes them unicode.
