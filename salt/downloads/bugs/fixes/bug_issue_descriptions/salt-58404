**Description**
`list_vdirs` from the win_iis module seems to fetch virtual directories using the powershell 'Get-WebVirtualDirectory' command. Cool. [Then it splits the name and fetches the last part of the path](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/win_iis.py#L1722). 
This means any virtual directory that is has a name of (for example) Content/Packages/Archive, will come back as 'Archive'

Subsequently, the [matching state won't work](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/states/win_iis.py#L701), because it keeps trying to 'clean up' the name.

**Setup**
Standard salt setup, applying the following .sls as a state:
```sls
ensure the nested vdir exists:
  win_iis.create_vdir:
    - name: Content/Packages/Archive
    - site: Default Web Site
    - sourcepath: 'C:\tmp'
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Apply the state twice. It won't work because the name that comes back will never match the name you put in.
