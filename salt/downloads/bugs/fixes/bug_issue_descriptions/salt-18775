I have a project that I recently upgraded salt from 2014.1.13 to 2014.7.0, located [here](https://github.com/umeboshi2/paella).  The project is using vagrant with the salt plugin that executes salt-call with a masterless configuration.

I created a stripped down version of the project on github to reproduce the error.

I left the logfile in the repository:

https://github.com/umeboshi2/masterless-salt-test/blob/master/provision.log

It seems to be attempting to load the pillar sls files from the saltstate root.

minion config is here:
https://github.com/umeboshi2/masterless-salt-test/blob/master/vagrant/salt/minion

and the states and pillar directories are here:
