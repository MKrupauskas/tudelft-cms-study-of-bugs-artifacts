We ran into an interesting problem this morning when upgrade a few of our systems to 2014.7.0.

2014.7.0's debian package has:
Breaks: python-mako (<< 0.7.0)

The problem here is that if you have python-mako installed and then you do an apt-get install salt-minion to upgrade salt, apt/dpkg will _remove_ python-mako **AND** and depending packages, like OpenERP.
This type of change makes me very nervous about salt's safety when upgrading/installing.

Can anyone help me understand why "Breaks: python-mako (<< 0.7.0)" is needed in the deb?

Thanks,

Rob
