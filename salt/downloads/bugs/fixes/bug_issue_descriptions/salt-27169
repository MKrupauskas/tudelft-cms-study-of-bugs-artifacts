I am seeing the same behavior below with the Salt Minion installed through Amazon Linux as recently as today.   As with the original post of this issue, I receive the same errors for any calls using the following states with a minion at v2015.5.5 :

```
 pkg.installed
 user.present
```

Errors reported for each one are below:

```
Function: user.present
Result: False

```

I can repeat this behavior with any Salt Minion installed on Amazon Linux that is running v 2015.5.5.  However, my Salt Minions that are using version 2014.7.5 work without issues using the same Salt Master and SLS files.  My Salt Master is version 2015.5.5.  

Thanks,
