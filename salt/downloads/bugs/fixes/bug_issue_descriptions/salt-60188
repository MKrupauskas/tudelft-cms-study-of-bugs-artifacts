Jinja2 3.0 was released a few days ago and seems like Salt can't work with it.

We have issues like this:

```
    Data failed to compile:'

    Rendering SLS ''base:formula.logstash.common/install'' failed: Jinja variable ''pillar'' is undefined'
/opt/behavox/salt/cache/minion/files/base/formula/kibana/vars.yaml(2):'

{% set third_party_packages_path = pillar.get(''third_party_packages_path'') %}    <======================'

```
