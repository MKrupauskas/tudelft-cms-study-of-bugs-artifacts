### Description of Issue/Question
In Fluorine when running minion in debug mode after key is accepted it gets flooded with this line. It gets added every second, it just adds and adds 
```
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job __mine_interval was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job __mine_interval was scheduled with a max number of 2
```

### Setup
Install Fluorine. I used this commit: 1f668c0

```
wget -O bootstrap.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sh bootstrap.sh -g https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git -M -P git 1f668c0011394f508c3a5dc8062ca246f1dce0c6
