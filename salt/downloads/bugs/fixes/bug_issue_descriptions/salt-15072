Hello,

The upstart script in 2014.1.10 works ok for me in Ubuntu 12.04, but not when I try 2014.7.

I am testing with this Vagrant box:
https://vagrantcloud.com/hashicorp/precise64

I get this exception on start:
`2014-08-19 00:04:05,510 [salt.log.setup   ][ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
OSError: [Errno 10] No child processes

When I try to restart the service I get this:
`vagrant@master-1:~$ sudo service salt-master restart`
`stop: Job has already been stopped: salt-master`

I am able to start the service manually with 
`salt-master -l debug`

I'm not sure why it only wants to run from the command line in the foreground with debug enabled.

Thanks for any help.
