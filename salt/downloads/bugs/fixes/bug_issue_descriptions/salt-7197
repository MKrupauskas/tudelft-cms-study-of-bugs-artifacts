EDITED by @basepi:  Repurposing this bug report for the potential pillar security implications of being able to match on pillar, _specifically_ with globbing.

I'm thinking these two calls should've reported the same number (well not really because the mine.get call has two extra lines of output but 34 is too different)

```
root@salt-master:/home/salt# salt -I location:1 test.ping | wc -l
     66
root@salt-master:/home/salt# salt monitoring mine.get 'location:1' 'test.ping' expr_form='pillar' | wc -l
    100
```

The latter returns all the minions, where it should only return the minions where the `location` pillar is `1`, right?

This works for grains, and the manual says it should work for pillars as well.

```
Targets can be matched based on any standard matching system that can be matched on the master via these keywords:

glob
pcre
grain
grain_pcre
pillar
```

Mine config:

```
mine_functions:
  network.interfaces: []
  test.ping: []

#auto-update twee keer per dag
mine_interval: 720
```
