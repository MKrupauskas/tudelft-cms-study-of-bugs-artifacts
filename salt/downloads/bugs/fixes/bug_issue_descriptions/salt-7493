If I call highstate on any minion individually, everything works file. However, if I call `sudo salt \* state.highstate`, the highstate takes a very long time (like 5 minutes when any individual highstate returns in less than 45 seconds), and the highstate will frequently fail with ZeroMQ errors. There are only ~12 minions, and they're all inside the same VPC.

I have attached the output of the salt command to a gist here: 
https://gist.github.com/jthigpen/7022e6ddad40f901dd44#file-salt-zmq-error-highstate-log-L1136

Line 1136 is where the ZeroMQ errors start.

We're running on Ubuntu 12.04, Salt is running 16.4 across the board, and we use the bootstrapper to install everything.

Versions report is here: https://gist.github.com/jthigpen/9d85b95c43224320789a

Let me know if there's some other information I can get for you.
