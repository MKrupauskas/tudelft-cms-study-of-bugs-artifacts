### Description of Issue/Question

From time to time, when executing a specific function against a groups of network devices managed through proxy minions using the [NAPALM proxy](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/proxy/napalm.py), we encounter the following error:

``` bash
# salt edge01.yyz01 ntp.peers
edge01.yyz01:
    'ntp.peers' is not available.
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

In the example above, I have executed the function `peers` from the `napalm_ntp` module, having the virtual name `ntp`: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/napalm_ntp.py#L77

Executing the same function against a different target:

``` bash
# salt edge01.akl01 ntp.peers
edge01.akl01:
    ----------
    comment:
    out:
        - 172.17.17.1
        - 172.17.17.2
    result:
        True
```

(I have obfuscated the IP addresses in previous output, otherwise nothing was changed).

But executing a different function (e.g. `snmp.config` - soon to be published) against the same minion as previously:

``` bash
# salt edge01.akl01 snmp.config
edge01.akl01:
    'snmp.config' is not available.
```
### Setup

The setup is the same as described in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/34446, without the changes from https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/35178.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Unfortunately I am not sure how to reproduce this issue. Given that I am still not aware of deeper Salt internals, I would need your guidance to identify the steps.
Initially I thought it is a caching issue - but the modules are cached in only one place for all proxies and they become unavailable only for some of them.
Restarting the proxy process fixes the problem, but this is not a comfortable solution since this kind of events are not deterministic (or, at least, I was not able to identify a pattern).
Sometimes we get the message `* is not available` a couple of hours after the proxy is started, sometimes after a couple of days.
