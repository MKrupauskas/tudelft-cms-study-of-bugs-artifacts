Hi,

svn.export reports an issue with an invalid change data when using svn.export. Looking at the code, it shows that the changes structure is not constructed correctly. This might be for historical reasons.

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/117d3356db30905050ff41ffbe70a356a7ee34ae/salt/states/svn.py#L234

`ret['changes'] = name + ' was Exported to ' + target`

should be changed to

`ret['changes']['new'] = name`
`ret['changes']['comment'] = name + ' was Exported to ' + target`

version Salt: 2014.7.trunk

I will provide a fix for that.

Another issue is that the change detection itself cannot work correctly. Right now and with the fix, it would always report a change. The general problem behind it is that it looks difficult to detect a change on a directory that is not under version control. Does anybody has an idea on how to do that?

Cheers,
