### Broken Jinja in top file makes minions not to see it

### Setup
Centos 7, add salt repo, `yum install salt-master salt-minion`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
base:
  '*':
    # Here I place a comment on the following state, with a broken jinja command {{broken}}
    - do_something
```

This results in:
```
# salt \* state.apply
frontend:
----------
          ID: states
    Function: no.None
      Result: False
     Comment: No Top file or master_tops data matches found.
     Changes:   

Summary for frontend
------------
Succeeded: 0
Failed:    1
```

```

I've spent half an hour to solve this issue. Is this behaviour normal? Couldn't we add a more detailed error or add a reference to watch in the logs? I could create a PR if you agree
