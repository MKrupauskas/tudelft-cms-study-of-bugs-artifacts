### Expected Behavior

I should be able to configure reactor driven orchestrations to use queue=True for anything that involves running a state.
### Actual Behavior

Perhaps I'm just missing it in the docs, but I've tried a number of ways to achieve this and nothing seems to work.

### Relevant Logs, Configs, or States

I've tried the following without success yet.
