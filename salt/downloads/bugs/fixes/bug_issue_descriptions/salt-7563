I've got an issue where I want to create a lock for a release so that multiple people can't run an overstate at once.

I thought it would be as simple as touching a lock file in /tmp but for some reason overstate has weird behavior when running concurrently with another overstate.

What happens is that I get a lot of `Data failed to compile` errors because the state was already running.  However, the overstate doesn't drop out once that happens, instead it proceeds trying to execute the following states (presumably because they're finishing on the one that was launched first).

I can get some examples to you later, but I think it probably has something to do with how the overstate system is event driven and not sandboxed between overstates (I'm just assuming this.)
