### Description of Issue/Question

The pkg.installed state does not seem to have a good way to install a specific architecture of a .deb package.  I basically want salt to run something like "apt-get install zlib1g:i386" on an amd64 ubuntu machine, but when I use the name zlib1g:i386 I get a warning that this is a virtual package and support for this will be removed in the flourine release (and by the looks of the git log, support has now been removed).

### Setup / Steps to Reproduce Issue
I have a state like the following:

misc-pkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - zlib1g:i386

When it is applied on an amd64 ubuntu machine, I get the following warning:

    Warnings: The following package(s) are "virtual package" names: zlib1g:i386.
              These will no longer be supported as of the Fluorine release.
              Please update your SLS file(s) to use the actual package name.

But this is not a virtual package, as far as I can tell.  "apt-cache show zlib1g:i386" shows the info for the i386 architecture variant of the zlib1g package.
