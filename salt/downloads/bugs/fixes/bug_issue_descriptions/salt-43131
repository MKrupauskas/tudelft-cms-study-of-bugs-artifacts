### Description of Issue/Question

If `G@kernel:Linux` and `root` is not None, **-R** got appended to a command that can be:

 * gpasswd
 * usermod (suse 11)

at least on my Debian, the former requires **-Q** for specifying a chroot. I suspect this is broken elsewhere, currently downloading openbsd/netbsd/suse11 vagrant boxes so I can check this.

I can work on this but I'd prefer to wait for #43105 merge so I don't have to cope with conflicts given interested code lines.

Thank you !
