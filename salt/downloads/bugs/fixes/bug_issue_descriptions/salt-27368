I noticed this while investigating another issue around the append/prepend functionality. The code uses `'\n'`, which is probably not appropriate on Windows. Should probably change that to `os.linesep`.

Could alternatively add a `linesep` parameter that defaults to `os.linesep`, so people can override if they choose?
