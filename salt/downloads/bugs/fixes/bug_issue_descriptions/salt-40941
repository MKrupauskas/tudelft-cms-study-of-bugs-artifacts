### Description of Issue/Question
`integration.client.test_standard.StdTest.test_full_returns` fails on Windows Py2 tests. `self.client.cmd_full_return` sends the `test.ping` command to the minion. It's returning an empty dict. The value of `ret` is `{}`. This is either because the `test.ping` command is failing, which I would expect to have a dict with `success: False` or the minion is not returning. Maybe it's a problem with `self.client.cmd_full_return`, I have know idea where the code for that is. Anyway, here's the code that's failing:
```
        ret = self.client.cmd_full_return(
                'minion',
                'test.ping',
                )
        self.assertIn('minion', ret)
        self.assertEqual({'ret': True, 'success': True}, ret['minion'])
```
And here's the traceback as shown by the test suite.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\testing\tests\integration\client\test_standard.py", line 117, in test_full_returns
    self.assertIn('minion', ret)
AssertionError: 'minion' not found in {}
```
Digging into the `salt-runtests.log` I can find the job ID for the `test.ping`, but following it through the rest of the log, I can't see where it returns.

However, starting the test suite in `interactive` mode, the minion successfully returns True to a `test.ping` command. And it's obvious from the `salt-runtests.log` file that the minion is returning.

### Setup
Install `salt` and `pytest-salt` in development mode.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Navigate to `salt\tests` and run `python runtests.py -v -n integration.client.test_standard.StdTest.test_full_returns`

Observe the failure
