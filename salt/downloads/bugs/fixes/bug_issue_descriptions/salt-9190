I'm experiencing the following:
- state.highstate works just fine.
- state.sls [some state] fails to render pillar data

state.sls appears to render pillar data completely differently somehow.

In debugging this, I reduced the pillar file to just a few lines: compute a variable, and then just output it. (For debugging.) The whole file is ~5 lines long, but I still get the same error: and it's point to a line in the file that no longer exists. (Also note that, on the errored line, the error is "undefined variable"; the only variable on that line is "nodes_by_role", and that's definitely defined several lines earlier.)

The error:

```
[my machine]:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering SLS 'parse' failed, render error:
Undefined jinja variable; line 34 in template

[...]

# always is a list, even if there is only one db node
{% set db_node_ips = nodes_by_role[1][1:][0]|map(attribute='ip_interfaces')|map(attribute='eth1')|map('first')|list %}

# assumes there is only one metric ip
{% set metrics_ip = nodes_by_role[2][1:][0][0]['ip_interfaces']['eth1']|first %}    <======================

# always is a list, even if there is only one storage node
{% set storage_node_ips = nodes_by_role[3][1:][0]|map(attribute='ip_interfaces')|map(attribute='eth1')|map('first')|list %}

# always is a list, even if there is only one work node
[...]
```

The SLS file `parse.sls` looks like:

```
{% set all_grains = salt['saltutil.cmd']('cluster:' ~ grains['cluster'], 'grains.items', expr_form='grain').values()|map(attribute='ret')|list %}
{% set nodes_by_role = all_grains | groupby('role') %}

nodes_by_role: |
  {{ nodes_by_role }}
```

Note how this is completely different than what's visible in the above error.
(It was changed from that, but no amount of waiting seems to update it.)

The SLS file `test/write_file.sls`:

```
/root/hi:
  file:
    - managed
    - source: salt://test/templ.sls
    - template: jinja
```

The SLS file `test/templ.sls`:

```
nodes_by_roles: |
  {{ pillar['nodes_by_role'] }}
```

And the command:

```
salt 'my-machine' state.sls test.write_file
```
