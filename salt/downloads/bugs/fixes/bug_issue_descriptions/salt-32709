### Description of Issue/Question

If create a Saltfile with such content:

``` yaml
salt-ssh:
  roster_file: ./roster
```

And call `salt-ssh` like that - `sudo salt-ssh --roster-file=/home/user/completely_different_roster ... state.highstate ...`, Salt-SSH will take roster from `./roster` location instead of one provided through commandline.
