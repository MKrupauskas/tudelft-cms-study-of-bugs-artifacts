I received an updated yumpkg.py (for my 2014.1.7 version of Salt) from one of your esteemed members and today upgraded my Salt installation to 2014.1.10 (CentOS 6.5).  All group installs fail and only succeed when I use the attached yumpkg.py and sync_modules.  I thought this would have been merged into the 2014.1.10 release.  Will this issue be addressed in future releases?

Hmmm, can't attach  the file (at least not in this UI).  Anyway, the failure is due to the missing --plugins option for the yum-related command line strings.
