I'm having an issue trying to get the salt-minion setup on the generic centos7 cloud image. 
`CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-20150628_01.qcow2`

I load the image into openstack, create an instance, ssh in, bootstrap salt-minion.
I've tried both -X and deleting minion_id before final cleanup and shutting down the instance and creating a snapshot for boot. 

I log in, and the minion_id is set to the old hostname, while /etc/hostname has the correct hostname. 
I initially thought maybe if I move salt-minion down the module list in cloud-init it would fix it, but no go. 

The exact same process works flawless on the Ubuntu cloud image. I just went in, bootstrapped, deleted minion_id file and the snapshot boots up and saltminion connects with the proper hostname.
