Softlayer apparently changed their API recently, and the Softlayer HW cloud provider includes a call to getBareMetalInstances when it should be getHardware according to Softlayer. I'd like to get this into Salt  - should I submit a pull request, and if so, to which branch?

https://github.com/highlyunavailable/salt/commit/96885f615cd56d1800f5c9c398b2a1a8a64b1cad is my fork with the change. It's literally 1 line, and I've tested it on my local Salt infrastructure with no issues.
