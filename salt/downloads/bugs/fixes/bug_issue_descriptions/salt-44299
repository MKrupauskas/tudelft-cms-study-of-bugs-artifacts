### Description of Issue/Question

The 2017.7.2 update to SaltStack breaks pkgrepo.managed comments. This is a regression and a re-occurrence of Issue #34963, which was resolved by PR #41820.

### Setup
```
# file: /srv/salt/examplerepo.sls
examplerepo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - baseurl: http://example.com/repo
    - enabled: 0
    - comments:
      - this is a comment
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Initially, running a `state.apply` for the above sls file in test mode correctly reports that the repo will be configured. Running a `state.apply` with test mode turned off also correctly configures the repo file with the desired comments.

The problems happen when the repo has already been configured correctly and no changes need to be made to the repo file. Subsequent runs of `state.apply` will rewrite the repo file every time.  Subsequent runs of `state.apply` with `test=True` will always report that the 

```
$ cat /etc/yum.repos.d/examplerepo.repo 

[examplerepo]
name=examplerepo
enabled=0
baseurl=http://example.com/repo
#this is a comment
$ sudo salt 'master' state.apply examplerepo test=True
master:
----------
          ID: examplerepo
    Function: pkgrepo.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: Package repo 'examplerepo' will be configured. This may cause pkg states to behave differently than stated if this action is repeated without test=True, due to the differences in the configured repositories.

### Details
The issue was caused by commit ca1b1bb6334da6597b97ae411d65b98844c8f661, which modified the _parse_repo_file function in `salt/modules/yumpkg.py` to use [ConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html) for repo file parsing rather than parsing the repo file itself. ConfigParser does not parse comments.
```
$ cat /etc/yum.repos.d/examplerepo.repo 

[examplerepo]
name=examplerepo
enabled=0
baseurl=http://example.com/repo
#this is a comment
$ python

>>> p.sections()

>>> p.items('examplerepo')
[('name', 'examplerepo'), ('enabled', '0'), ('baseurl', 'http://example.com/repo')]
>>> 
```

`pkgrepo.managed` yum repo comments will not work until we extend ConfigParser to deal with comments or revert the above commit.
