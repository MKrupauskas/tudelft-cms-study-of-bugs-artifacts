### Description of Issue/Question
When modifying the hosts file using [states.host](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/host.py) the entire file is rewritten to use 1 IP entry and a number of aliases.

Example:
```
127.0.0.1 alias1
127.0.0.1 alias2
127.0.0.1 alias3
```

Gets rewritten into:
```
127.0.0.1 alias1 alias2 alias3
```

Problems start appearing with large numbers of host aliases pointing to the same IP, [since the number of characters in a hosts file line is limited to 256](https://www.uow.edu.au/~blane/netapp/ontap/nag/networking/concept/c_oc_netw_maintaining_host_file_limits.html) (can anyone find an RFC for this?) which essentially becomes 254 because of \n\r line endings under windows.

Besides, there is [undocumented behaviour](https://superuser.com/questions/932112/is-there-a-maxium-number-of-hostname-aliases-per-line-in-a-windows-hosts-file) under Windows that limits the number of aliases in a hosts entry to 8 (1 host + 8 aliases). I was able to reproduce this under Windows Server 2016 with the following:

"alias" host entries stop being loaded into dns cache with alias10 (`ipconfig /displaydns`).

Same behaviour not present in Ubuntu Xenial, where I am able to ping alias10:

I am happy to submit a patch for [modules.hosts](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/hosts.py) where this is handled. However I would like to discuss the approach.

Regarding line character limit:
1. Stop using aliases, and have one `IP Hostname` entry per line;
2. Add aliases until the character limit is passed, at which point we break to the following line;

Regarding windows handling of aliases:
1. Identify if we are running under windows (via os grain) and handle hosts file differently;
2. Apply window's undocumented limits to all OSs and err on the safe side;

### Setup
1 sls file with:
```
hosts_updater.set_windows_routes.{{redacted}}: 
  host.present:
    - ip: 127.0.0.1
    - names:
      - "{{redacted}}.redacted.info"
```
