In 2015.8.4, "pillar_merge_lists" was introduced. It was erroneously set as the default behaviour until 2015.8.7, but even now, you can't seem to change it in the master configuration - changing it has no effect.

Old issue text:

Using salt-ssh, checked out on the tag `v2015.8.3`, lists are overwritten, not merged, in pillars.

Checked out on the tag `v2015.8.4`, lists are merged. This seems to be the case in the latest 2015.8 HEAD as well.

It doesn't even seem to matter what I set `pillar_merge_lists` to in my config file.

I see several additions like these in the code between 2015.8.3 and 2015.8.4:

```
self.opts.get('pillar_merge_lists', 'False')

merge_lists = __opts__.get(
    'pillar_merge_lists',
    'False'
)
```

Why is False inside quotes? The string `'False'` evaluates to true, which is probably the cause of this bug.
