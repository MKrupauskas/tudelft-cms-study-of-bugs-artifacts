Hi,

I'm trying to create VM running windows 7 on proxmox, using salt-cloud and 'qemu' technology.

Here are my provider and profile files:

The .iso file provided as 'image' is a working windows7 image.
It creates VM's, but with no disk space, and no OS installed on it. Could someone give me a hint of what I am doing wrong ?

Thank you very much.
