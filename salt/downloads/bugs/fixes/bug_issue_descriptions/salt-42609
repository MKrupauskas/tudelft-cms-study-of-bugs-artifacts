If a runit service is setup where the symlink points to a differently named directory, it becomes Schrodinger's service and exists as part of runit.get_all(), but not as part of runit.avilable()

```
# ls -l /etc/service/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jul 19 15:01 tftp -> /opt/tftp.runit/
# salt-call service.get_all
local:
    - tftp.runit
# salt-call service.available tftp
local:
    False
# salt-call service.available tftp.runit
local:
    False
```
