I'm not entirely sure what controls this, but in the highstate output when a state runs but did not have to do anything (ie, already in the correct state) the colour is green and when it makes a change it's a cyanish colour.

The ports state module output is always green, even when changes were made:

```
    State: - ports
    Name:      lang/php55
    Function:  installed
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Successfully installed lang/php55 with the following build options: CGI=on, FPM=on, IPV6=on, CLI=on, LINKTHR=on
        Changes:
```

Is coloured green for example, despite the indication in the comment that it made a change.

For comparison when no change is made (and the colour is also green) the following comment is seen:

```
    State: - ports
    Name:      lang/php55
    Function:  installed
        Result:    True
        Comment:   lang/php55 is already installed with the following build options: CGI=on, FPM=on, IPV6=on, CLI=on, LINKTHR=on
        Changes:
```
