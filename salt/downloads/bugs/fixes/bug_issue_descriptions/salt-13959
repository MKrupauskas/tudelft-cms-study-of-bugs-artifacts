I'm experiencing a problem in a multi-master setup where my minions don't run highstate automatically on start-up, despite having "startup_states: highstate" in their configuration file. 

My /etc/salt/minion file looks like this:

```
master:
  - salt-master-a.example.com
  - salt-master-b.example.com
log_level: debug
log_level_logfile: debug
startup_states: highstate
grains:
  roles:
    - couchbase
id: i-31ff4972
```

When the minion starts up, it connects to the master and running state.highstate manually works ok.

```
# salt-call --versions
           Salt: 2014.1.3
         Python: 2.7.3 (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:58:35)
         Jinja2: 2.6
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1

   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.4.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 13.0.0
            ZMQ: 3.2.2

# cat /var/log/salt/minion

```

...and that's about it, nothing else happens. If i have a single master, defined as:  "master: salt-master-a.example.com" in the configuration file, startup_states: highstate works ok.
