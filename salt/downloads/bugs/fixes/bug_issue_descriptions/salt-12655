I've been using salt-call publish.publish from a minion to talk to other minions and the performance has been slow. Here are the details:

Command invoked on minion:

```
/usr/bin/salt-call --out=json publish.publish '<obfuscated_minion_name>' cmd.run_all 'ls /tmp'
```

Here is the time reported:

```
real    0m48.107s
user    0m1.427s
sys 0m0.130s
```

Of course, the 'ls /tmp' command on the target minion itself takes little time:

```
real    0m0.015s
user    0m0.001s
sys 0m0.002s
```

The same command from the salt master takes little time:

```
salt '<obfuscated_minion_name>' cmd.run_all 'ls /tmp'
```

```
real    0m0.447s
user    0m0.356s
sys 0m0.035s
```

The behavior has been the same regardless of the command, the minion used as the source, or the minion used as the destination.
