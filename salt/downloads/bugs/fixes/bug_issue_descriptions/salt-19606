I have a state:

```
salt-minion:
  service.disabled
```

and then I run salt via:

```
alias salt-highstate='salt-call --local --file-root=$HOME/salt state.highstate'
```

I just expect to see the highstate output, but I also get this error message:

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'systemctl is-enabled salt-minion.service' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: disabled
```

.. this seems like not an error to me :)
