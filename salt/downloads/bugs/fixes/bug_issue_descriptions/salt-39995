In a Multimaster setup with two masters/minions, if both masters are stopped/killed the minions does not switch between trying to connect to the two masters, it only tries the first one in the minion config file. It just goes forever until you kill the process. I believe they should switch between trying to connect between the two master.

Also if the first master is stopped and the second  is running and restart the minions, they will not connect to the live master. It just says the stopped master is not responsive.

### Setup
minion config
```
master: 
  - 173.255.216.176
  - 173.255.252.194
id: minion_A
```

```
master: 
  - 173.255.216.176
  - 173.255.252.194
id: minion_B
```

minion log:
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set up multimaster environment. Stop both masters and start both minions. They should switch between trying to connect to the masters but they only try the first listed in the minion config file.

Start the second master in the list and restart the minions, they do not connect to the live master.
