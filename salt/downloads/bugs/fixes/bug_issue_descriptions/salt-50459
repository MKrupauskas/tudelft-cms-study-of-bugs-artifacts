PyGit2 is trying to use the wrong `.gitconfig` file when `salt-master` is launch as `root` but the user `/etc/salt/master` is set to a different one.

```
[CRITICAL] Exception caught while initializing gitfs remote '#########': failed to stat '/root/.gitconfig'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/gitfs.py", line 449, in __init__
    self.new = self.init_remote()
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/utils/gitfs.py", line 1604, in init_remote
    self.repo = pygit2.init_repository(self.cachedir)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pygit2/__init__.py", line 149, in init_repository
    check_error(err)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/pygit2/errors.py", line 64, in check_error
    raise GitError(message)
_pygit2.GitError: failed to stat '/root/.gitconfig'
[CRITICAL] Failed to load gitfs
[CRITICAL] Master failed pre flight checks, exiting
```

I think the problem is the way in which the `search_path` for the global config for pygit2 is set

I understand that launching `salt-master` as root but setting it for running as another user is the intended purpose with the current implementation. At least, this is what I understand after reading the [official guide](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/nonroot.html).

Please, correct me if I am wrong.
