### Description of Issue/Question

Attempting to run highstate against a minion with multiple pip.installed definitions results in an exception:

```
State 'pip.installed' was not found in SLS 'k8s'
Reason: 'pip.installed' is not available.
````

However, this only occurs if the pip version is **9.0.2**, and not if the pip version **9.0.1**. When the pip version is 9.0.1, the highstate functions normally. This occurs regardless of whether I refresh the modules.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

```
kubernetes:
  pip.installed: 
    - name: kubernetes==3.0
    - reload_modules: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Define the pip.installed definition as above, install pip 9.0.2 on the minion. Results in:

```
          ID: kubernetes
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: kubernetes==3.0
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'pip.installed' was not found in SLS 'k8s'
              Reason: 'pip.installed' is not available.
```

If run on the minion:

```
[root@node ~]$ sudo salt-call state.highstate
[ERROR   ] Failed to import states pip_state, this is due most likely to a syntax error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    from . import packages

    sys.modules['pip._vendor.requests.packages.' + mod] = sys.modules["pip._vendor." + mod]
KeyError: 'pip._vendor.urllib3.urllib'
```

Downgrade pip to 9.0.1 (with ``pip install pip==9.0.1``) and the highstate is correctly applied.
