### Description of Issue/Question

Previously, had opened #26398 for use of `file://` URIs in `file.managed`. This was addressed and incorporated into SaltStack. Looks like a similar functionality is missing in `file.recurse` (was attempting to use `file.recurse` to copy `/etc/skel` to newly-attached home directories: wanted to use the local `/etc/skel` contents rather than pushing such content as part of formula`
### Setup

Saltstack on Enterprise Linux 7 VM/instance.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try to use `file://` in the `source:` field of `file.recurse`.
