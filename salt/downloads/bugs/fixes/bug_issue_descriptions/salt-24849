Several file states seem to do `if __opts['test']__: ret['result'] = None`, which means that watch statements and similar aren't always triggered when running in test mode.

For example, if a `file.absent` state is set to remove a directory, a service watching that directory won't be reloaded/restarted.

On the flip side, if a `file.managed` changes the contents of a file, that will reload/restart the service.

This is only in test mode, in a real run everything seems to work fine. I was going to do a pull request but noticed that the code `if __opts['test']__: ret['result'] = None` is repeated _a lot_ in states/file.py, so maybe there is a good reason I'm unaware of.
