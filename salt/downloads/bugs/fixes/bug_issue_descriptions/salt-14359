Good Morning,

Trying to use the tomcat war_deployed state against a HTTP Basic Auth URL on a Sonatype Nexus instance, the initial requested is authenticated but the redirect isn't.

I've confirmed this with tcpdump running on the minion.

Extracts of the Request / Response from "tcpdump port http -i eth0 -vvv -A":

Initial request:

```
    GET /nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?a=REDACTED&e=war&g=REDACTED&r=REDACTED&v=REDACTED HTTP/1.1
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    Host: RETACTED
    Connection: close
    User-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7
```

Response:

```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2014 09:23:17 GMT
    Set-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/nexus; Max-Age=0; Expires=Sun, 20-Jul-2014 09:23:17 GMT
    WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager API"
    Connection: close
    Server: Jetty(7.5.4.v20111024)
```

Authenticated Request:

```
    GET /nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?a=REDACTED&e=war&g=REDACTED&r=REDACTED&v=REDACTED HTTP/1.1
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    Host: REDACTED
    Connection: close
    Authorization: Basic REDACTED
    User-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7
```

301 Redirect:

```
    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2014 09:23:17 GMT
    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=fbdeec7e-0629-4864-80ce-2631b586d197; Path=/nexus; HttpOnly
    Set-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/nexus; Max-Age=0; Expires=Sun, 20-Jul-2014 09:23:17 GMT
    Content-Type: application/xml; charset=ISO-8859-1
    Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2014 09:23:17 GMT
    Location: http://REDACTED/nexus/service/local/repositories/REDACTED/content/com/REDACTED.war
    Vary: Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Accept
    Server: Noelios-Restlet-Engine/1.1.6-SONATYPE-5348-V4
    Content-Length: 211
    Connection: close

    If you are not automatically redirected use this url: http://REDACTED/nexus/service/local/repositories/REDACTED/content/com/REDACTED.war
```

Failing Request without Authentication:

```
    GET /nexus/service/local/repositories/REDACTED/content/com/REDACTED.war HTTP/1.1
    Accept-Encoding: identity
    Host: REDACTED
    Connection: close
    User-Agent: Python-urllib/2.7
```

Request that fails which IMMO should work:

```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Date: Mon, 21 Jul 2014 09:23:17 GMT
    Set-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/nexus; Max-Age=0; Expires=Sun, 20-Jul-2014 09:23:17 GMT
    WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager API"
    Connection: close
    Server: Jetty(7.5.4.v20111024)
```

This seems to be present in both 2014.1.7 & the develop branch.
