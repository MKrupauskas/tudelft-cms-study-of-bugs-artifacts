Hi,

pkgrepo.managed has the following in its docstring:

```
    disabled                                                                     
        Toggles whether or not the repo is used for resolving dependencies       
        and/or installing packages.                                              

    enabled                                                                      
        Enables the repository, even if the repository has been disabled, in     
        order for the respective package requiring the repository can be found   
        and installed.
```

which I find rather confusing. Despite the fact that this isn't working (cf. #20096, but I'm working on this), it is unclear what these options should do.

I can't really fix #20096 without knowing what the _intended_ effect of these settings should be.

Superficially one might assume that you really don't need two settings to reflect the "enabled" state of a repository, as one should simply be the negation of the other. An enabled repository is not disabled and vice versa.

There must, however, be something the author of these options intended, so I would kindly ask you to clarify the following:
1. What is the expected behaviour if _both_ enabled and disabled are set to True?
2. What is the expected behaviour if neither are specified and:
   2.1 ... the sources.list entry has been commented
   2.2 ... the sources.list entry is missing?
3. How do these settings relate to pkg.absent ?

My, na√Øve one might argue, expectation is that "pkgrepo.managed" allows me to use that repository later on while a "pkgrepo.absent" removes a given one. I'd argue that "enabled" should be "True" by default, while "disabled" should be false.

Looking into the code one finds a lot of unhealthy munging of the disabled state and obscure references to yum .... So: Please clarify!
