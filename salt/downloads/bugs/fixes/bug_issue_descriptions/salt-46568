### Description of Issue/Question
While investigating the issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/46236 I ran into another problem with the LGPO module. While trying to replicate the issue above, I modified some settings in the Local Machine Group Policy using `gpedit.msc` (Windows Server 2016). I modified settings in **Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->Windows Components->App Privacy**. I changed 2 policies to `Enabled` and 2 policies to `Disabled`. Then I applied the state defined in the above issue. I was unable to replicate the issue above, but I did notice that the Group Policy objects that were set to `Disabled` were now reset back to `Not Configured`.

### Setup
Set some policies in **Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->Windows Components->App Privacy** to `Disabled`.
Make sure `Configure Automatic Updates` is set to `Not Configured` **(Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->Windows Components->Windows Update)**

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply the state defined in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/46236

### Versions Report
Tested on 2017.7.3 and the HEAD of 2017.7 which would include 2017.7.4
