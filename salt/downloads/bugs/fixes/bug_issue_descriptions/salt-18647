If you add a version number to the state name in an npm state (like coffee-script@1.0.1 from the docs) then `states/npm.py` will correctly check whether that version is installed, but it does not actually pass that version to npm when it tries to install. I believe the offending code is line 170 of `npm.py`:

`cmd_args['pkg'] = pkg_name  # note that version is not included`
