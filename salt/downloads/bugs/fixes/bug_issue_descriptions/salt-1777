Hi,
my problem is the "unless" directive does not support bash syntax, so I can't do this:
- unless: "(( $(cmd | wc -l) > 0 ))"

Bear in mind that "[ -gt" kinda does the same thing as "(( ))", but using the [ command sucks and I don't want to use it (it's much easier to make bugs due to wrong quoting, esoteric syntax, etc).

Given that salt might be used in places there's no bash, I suggest that the syntax of the default shell in the system the state is being applied to is supported. This means bash on debians, ksh on freebsd.
