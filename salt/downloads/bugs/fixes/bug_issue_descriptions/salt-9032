I tried this is my state file:

```
D:\\tomcats\tomcat-jenkins\webapps:
  file.directory:
    - makedirs: True
  cmd.script:
    - name: salt://scripts/set-webappsACL.ps1
```

It ran successfully, that is, it set the ACL on the folder as intended, but cmd.script removed my file /scripts/set-webappsACL.ps1 after the run.  I thought maybe it was being overwritten because it needed a working directory, so I modified to use templates, like this:

```
D:\\tomcats\tomcat-jenkins\webapps:
  file.directory:
    - makedirs: True
  cmd.script:
    - name: set-webappsACL.ps1
    - cwd: D:\temp
    - source: salt://templates/setCIacls.ps1
    - context:
      DIR: D:\tomcats\tomcat-jenkins\webapps
    - require:
      - file: D:\\temp
```

But, still, cmd.script removed (overwrote?) my file /templates/setCIacles.ps1
