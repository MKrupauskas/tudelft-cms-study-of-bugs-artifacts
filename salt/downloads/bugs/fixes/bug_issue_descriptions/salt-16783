When targeting minions from the master using anything other then the minion ID search, so grains, compound, etc, the minion and their results will be returned but the message `No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned` is also returned.

Example 1

```
sudo salt -G 'environment:dev' test.ping
node1.dev.private.io:
    True
node2.dev.private.io:
    True
node3.dev.private.io:
    True
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

Example 2

```
sudo salt -C 'G@environment:dev' cmd.run uptime
node1.dev.private.io:
     13:43:30 up 24 days, 18:52,  0 users,  load average: 0.02, 0.02, 0.05
node2.dev.private.io:
     13:43:30 up 24 days, 23:37,  1 user,  load average: 1.60, 1.72, 1.64
node3.dev.private.io:
     13:43:30 up 70 days, 20:28,  0 users,  load average: 4.21, 3.37, 2.78
