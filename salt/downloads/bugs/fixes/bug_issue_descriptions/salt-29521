Following up on #29517 

We use the salt message bus to do some event driven infrastructure. One example is pushing an event to the master every time we push a changeset to our mercurial server.

This is in a mercurial hook which is not asynchronous. So it is important to keep the time it takes to execute low. 

Right now, on our infrastructure 

```
# time salt-call --skip-grains --log-level quiet event.send hg$PWD
local:
    True

real    0m3.085s
user    0m1.148s
sys     0m0.080s
```

Are there ways of reducing this 3s execution time. Can you point us in some direction to debug why this is taking so long ? Is this related to the bugs referenced in https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/releases/2015.8.0.html#tornado-tcp-transport ? #26051 ?

We're willing to help out debug this problem.
