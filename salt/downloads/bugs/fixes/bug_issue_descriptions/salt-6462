Using salt-master/salt-minion 0.16.0 from your repo on Debian:

I am running the following command from the salt-master:

```
salt 'client01' extfs.mkfs /dev/mapper/vol1-new fs_type=ext4 test=True (or anything else as the third argument)
```

and getting this error:

```
client01:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 626, in _thread_return
        ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/salt/modules/extfs.py", line 89, in mkfs
        opt = kwarg_map[key]
    KeyError: '__pub_user'
```

Commenting this block of code (obviously) in extfs.py fixes the issue and allows me to at least format the partition in ext4.

```
    opts = ''
    for key in kwargs.keys():
        opt = kwarg_map[key]
        if kwargs[key] == 'True':
            opts += '-{0} '.format(opt)
        else:
            opts += '-{0} {1} '.format(opt, kwargs[key])
```

The problem is also present for extfs.tune since it's using the same code.
