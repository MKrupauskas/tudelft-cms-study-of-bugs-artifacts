On a Debian 8 (jessie) system where lsb-release is not installed, the oscodename is wrong (it should be just "jessie"):

```
$ sudo salt debian grains.items   
[...]
   lsb_distrib_codename:
        Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
    lsb_distrib_id:
        Debian GNU/Linux
    lsb_distrib_release:
        8
[...]
    os:
        Debian
    os_family:
        Debian
    osarch:
        amd64
    oscodename:
        Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)
    osfullname:
        Debian GNU/Linux
    osrelease:
        8
```

When installing lsb-release, the output will be correct:

```
$ sudo salt debian grains.items   
[...]
    lsb_distrib_codename:
        jessie
    lsb_distrib_description:
        Debian GNU/Linux 8.4 (jessie)
    lsb_distrib_id:
        Debian
    lsb_distrib_os:
        GNU/Linux
    lsb_distrib_release:
        8.4
[...]
    os:
        Debian
    os_family:
        Debian
    osarch:
        amd64
    oscodename:
        jessie
    osfinger:
        Debian-8
    osfullname:
        Debian
    osmajorrelease:
        8
    osrelease:
        8.4
    osrelease_info:
        - 8
        - 4
```

salt 2016.3.0 and the develop branch are affected.

Currently `os_data()` is overly complex and has issues: When lsb-release is not found, it will fill out the lsb_\* values by falling back to various sources. Instead the lsb_\* values should only be set, when lsb-release is available.

Why don't you use `platform.linux_distribution()` if that provides useful information?

I am willing to fix this bug, but I don't want to add another quirk to make the code even less readable.
