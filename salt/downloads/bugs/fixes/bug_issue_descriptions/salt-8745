The following error is misleading:

```
salt-cloud: error: salt-cloud needs to run as the same user as salt-master, 'root', but was unable to switch credentials. Please run salt-cloud as root or as 'root'
```

The salt-cloud command should not require a master; it just needs appropriate write permissions.
