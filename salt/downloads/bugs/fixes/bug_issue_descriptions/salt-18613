              umount:
                  Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: UUID=dd8e82e0-6a81-49e2-8d67-9e828c118c15 (dd8e82e0-6a81-49e2-8d67-9e828c118c15), current: /dev/sdc1, /dev/sdc1
```

As you can see, I use the UUID, but it sees the raw device and tries to remount it. It shouldn't.

```
[root@clamps ~]# grep '/ ' /proc/mounts /etc/fstab 
/proc/mounts:/dev/sdc1 / ext4 rw,noatime,discard,data=ordered 0 0
/etc/fstab:UUID=dd8e82e0-6a81-49e2-8d67-9e828c118c15 / ext4 defaults,rw,noatime,data=ordered,discard 0 1
