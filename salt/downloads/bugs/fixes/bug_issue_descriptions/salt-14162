I submited #14158 and @terminalmage pointed out that the salt loader will pick non-underscored classes into the `__salt__` dictionary (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/14158#issuecomment-48815742).

I've printed `__salt__` dict and found that @terminalmage was correct. But I also found that `__salt__` contains one more class: `'pkg.depends': <class 'salt.utils.decorators.depends'>`. Is this by design? Shouldn't loader pick up only funcitons?
