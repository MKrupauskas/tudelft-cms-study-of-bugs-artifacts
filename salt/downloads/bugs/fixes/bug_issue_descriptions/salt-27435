Given the following state:

```
public:
  firewalld.present:
    - services:
      - salt-master
      - ssh
```

Salt will incorrectly execute the following `firewall-cmd` command when adding the `salt-master` service to the `public` zone:

```
$ /bin/firewall-cmd --new-service=salt-master --permanent
```

I believe it should be executing the following:

```
$ /bin/firewall-cmd --add-service=salt-master --permanent
```

See the output of `salt-call -l debug` below:

```
