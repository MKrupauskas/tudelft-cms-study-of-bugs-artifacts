I'm trying to run the following command:

```
$  sudo salt-run cloud.action start instance=myinstance provider=amazon-frankfurt
Exception occurred in runner cloud.action: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 337, in low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/runners/cloud.py", line 139, in action
    info = client.action(func, cloudmap, instances, provider, instance, kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 466, in action
    return mapper.do_function(provider, fun, kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1511, in do_function
    call='function', kwargs=kwargs
TypeError: start() got an unexpected keyword argument 'kwargs'
```

The `provider` and `instance` are correct relatively to the salt-cloud setup on the machine. The provider is configured as follow (relevant parameters only?)

```
amazon-frankfurt:
  driver: ec2
  location: eu-central-1
  [...]
```

I can provide more details if needed.
