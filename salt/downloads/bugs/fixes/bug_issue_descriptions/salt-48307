### Description of Issue/Question

When trying to build a [pex](/pantsbuild/pex) distribution of salt tied to the `salt-unity` script (to make it easy to use as a multipurpose distribution) we ran into an oddity.

`setup.py` specifies
```python
salt-unity = salt.scripts:salt_unity
```
But the unity functions don't actually live in `salt/scripts.py`.
This makes pex sad:
```
$ ./dist/salt.pex.old minion --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 367, in execute
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 293, in _wrap_coverage
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 325, in _wrap_profiling
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 410, in _execute
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 468, in execute_entry
  File ".bootstrap/_pex/pex.py", line 482, in execute_pkg_resources
  File ".bootstrap/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 2301, in resolve
ImportError: 'module' object has no attribute 'salt_unity'
```

By moving the unity functions into a `salt/unity.py` and making some additional changes (pull request to follow for review) I was able to get it to work:
```
$ ./dist/salt.pex minion --version
salt-minion 2018.3.0-575-g16d19ce (Oxygen)
```

I specifically didn't move the code into scripts.py because if it's in there I don't think it can properly introspect itself to get the list of functions to determine what it can safely do.

The pex file was built with:
```
pex -c salt-unity . -o dist/salt.pex
```
