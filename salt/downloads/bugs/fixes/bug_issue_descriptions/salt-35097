### Description of Issue/Question

Recently I have discovered that some of my minions are becoming unresponsive when trying to do anything:

```
cn42:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn11:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn58:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
cn59:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

I discovered they log this error then log nothing further until the salt-minion daemon is restarted:

```

```

Here's another example from another minion:

```

```
### Setup

I have dozens of minions.  This issue seems to effect them randomly.  I cannot attribute any change to any state, schedule, version, or anything else.  They just started randomly failing.
### Versions Report

I have not been able to attribute this to a specific version.  All my minions run 2016.3.1 as does my master.
