### Description of Issue/Question

If a bootstrap script produces a non-ascii character, salt-cloud will produce an exception when trying to print that text to the console. I suspect this is a case of some missing `.encode('utf-8')`'s.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The following bootstrap script is the simplest example I can come up with that reproduces the issue.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
print(u'\u2018')
```

It will produce an error similar to this:
```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2018' in position 89: ordinal not in range(128)
```
