On my system (Debian 7 + 2015.5.0) I see a newline appended to the end of the `HOME` variable anytime cmdmod.run is called.

On looking at the code, I think that there is a `.strip()` missing when the environment is set up. 

```
            py_code = (
                'import os, itertools; '
                'print \"\\0\".join(itertools.chain(*os.environ.items()))'
            )
```

Seems like it would output the environment with an extra newline hanging off the end, and that newline never gets stripped.

Probably

```
env_runas = dict(itertools.izip(*[iter(env_encoded.split(b'\0'))]*2))
```

Should become

```
env_runas = dict(itertools.izip(*[iter(env_encoded.strip().split(b'\0'))]*2))
```

Does this make sense? Seems like this could be a pretty gnarly bug for people.
