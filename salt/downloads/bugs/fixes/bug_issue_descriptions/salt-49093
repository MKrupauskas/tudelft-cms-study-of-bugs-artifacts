### Description of Issue/Question
In Fluorine, MultiMaster Failover dont work. If the original master goes down, minions wont connect to other master. If I manually restart the minions they will connect to the other master.

I see nothing in the logs, just nothing happens. If I restart the original stopped master I can continue to run commands from that master, they are still connected to that one.

### Setup
Install Fluorine. I used this commit: 1f668c0
```
wget -O bootstrap.sh https://bootstrap.saltstack.com
sh bootstrap.sh -g https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git -M -P git 1f668c0011394f508c3a5dc8062ca246f1dce0c6
```
Set up MultiMaster Failover setup
```
master:
  - master_a
  - master_b

master_shuffle: True
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Make sure minions are connected to one of the masters, stop that master and minions wont failover to other master.
