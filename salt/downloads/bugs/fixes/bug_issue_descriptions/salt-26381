The `user.present` documentation suggests that the `loginclass` argument is supported on BSD platforms. However, it does not appear to work on FreeBSD. A quick glance at the relevant source file (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/user.py) reveals several instances of code checking specifically for `OpenBSD`. For example:

``` python
    # OpenBSD login class
    if __grains__['kernel'] == 'OpenBSD':
        if not loginclass:
            loginclass = '""'
        if __salt__['user.get_loginclass'](name)['loginclass'] != loginclass:
            change['loginclass'] = loginclass
```

This code obviously isnâ€™t going to work when `__grains__['kernel'] == 'FreeBSD'`, even though `loginclass` is an important feature on FreeBSD.

Perhaps the various `== 'OpenBSD'` checks could be replaced with a substring match for `BSD`?
