A user has several masters with identical configurations using gitfs. One of the masters has a significantly higher minion count and load on it. This heavily loaded master often doesn't update its gitfs and requires a `salt-run git_pillar.update` to get the update to happen.

The master is running Salt 2014.1.5 and is a pretty powerful machine.

@terminalmage do you have any suggestions on where to start to troubleshoot this?
