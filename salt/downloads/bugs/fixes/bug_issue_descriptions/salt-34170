### Description of Issue/Question
1. `salt-call pip.install psutil` 
   output: installs psutil 4.3.0 (current stable release)
2. `salt-call ps.top`
   output:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-call", line 11, in <module>
    salt_call()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 345, in salt_call
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/call.py", line 58, in run
    caller.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 134, in run
    ret = self.call()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 197, in call
    ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/ps.py", line 135, in top
    user, system = process.cpu_times()
```

Investigating this on the minion:

```
>>> process = psutil.Process(1)
>>> process.cpu_times()
pcputimes(user=0.56, system=2.52, children_user=1088.18, children_system=73.1)
```

psutil.Process.cpu_times() now returns more than expected two values on Linux but not windows and OS X according to the documentation.

Salt documentation does not mention a requirement for psutil <=4.10 and the module does not handle the newer return value. Searching the issues for 'psutil' turns up several compatibility issues elsewhere, but none in the ps.top module. It is possible this issue is part of a larger cross-platform compatibility problem in the ps module.
### Setup

(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
- None, purely built in modules

psutil should be version 4.3.0

In 4.1.0 new fields were added, "Changed in version 4.1.0: return two extra fields: children_user and children_system." [http://pythonhosted.org/psutil/](url)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
1. install default psutil from pip on minion with ubuntu 14.04 LTS 
2. use built in ps.util module from either locally or remotely
