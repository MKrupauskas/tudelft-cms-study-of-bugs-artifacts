**Description**

Using `mysql_user.present` to set the mysql root password fails after the first run.

There is a catch where on first salt run mysql root password is empty, and on the second run it will error because the connection_pass is now different to the password that was set. A fix was made in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/9722 to do a "second attempt" connection to get around this problem, but it appears in later versions of salt this doesn't work any longer.

I've tracked it down to the addition of version checks: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L1450 because these checks open a connection in the `version` function, the connection errors before we can get to the code later in `user_exists` which tries again with another `connection_pass`: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L1470

**Setup**

```
mysql-server:
  pkg:
    - installed

set_localhost_root_password:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: root
    - host: localhost
    - password: {{ pillar['mysql.pass'] }}
    - connection_pass: ""
    - require:
      - pkg: mysql-server

create_databases:
  mysql_database.present:
    - name: mydb
    - require:
      - pkg: mysql-server
      - mysql_user: set_localhost_root_password
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Apply the mysql state with the above configuration. First apply will be successful on a fresh install of mysql or mariadb server.
Now apply it again, and it will error.

**Expected behavior**

I can apply state to set the mysql root user to a password stored in the pillar, and it doesn't error on subsequent applies either.
