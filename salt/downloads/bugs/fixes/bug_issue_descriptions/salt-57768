**Description**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

modules like salt/modules/service.py: def status() only return a boolean of True/False. this type of return is not handled properly by salt/states/module.py: def run() in
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/states/module.py#L429

So the state will always treat the module.run as True

**Setup**
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (be sure to remove sensitive info).

state file: /srv/salt/junk.sls
```
test-module:
  module.run:
    - service.status:
      - salt-api
```
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant)

Disable salt-api service on the salt master host
salt-call state.sls junk

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Expect the state to return failure for label test-module
