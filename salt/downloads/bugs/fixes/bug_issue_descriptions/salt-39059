### Description of Issue/Question

I am constantly seeing this exception in the master logs:

```

The master controls several proxy minions (SSH-based)
On the master I have several scheduler jobs that execute runners at specific intervals.

As the proxies are SSH-based they have the `multiprocessing` option set to `False` under the `proxy` config file (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/proxyminion/ssh.html)
Probably that's why the `multiprocessing` key does not exist in the opts.

However, the exception does not break anything.
