Either I am missing something in the docs, or currently looking at:
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.dockerng.html#docker-authentication
it seems that I _must_ provide registry configuration, whereas using normal docker installations I can just pull images from the public registry without any.
So, I had to create a pillar and include fake credentials to get going which is counter-intuitive I guess...

```
docker-registries:
  https://index.docker.io/v1/:
    email: foofoofoo@foo.com
    password: s3cr3t
    username: foofoo
```

My current workaround for this is to create a Dockerfile with only FROM line and then using:

```
xxx:
  dockerng.image_present:
    - build: /path/to/Dockerfile
```

but this is an ugly hack for an obvious behavior :-)
