(this is mostly a copy of [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/19332#issuecomment-206345583))

Currently it seems that ext_pillars (in particular, gitfs pillars) are not parsed in the order by which they're listed in the configuration, but rather by the order of their hashed directories in the saltmaster's cache. I.e., let's say you have this configuration:

``` sls
ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - master git@gitserver.com:pillars1.git
    - master git@gitserver.com:pillars2.git
```

The saltmaster will fetch these repositories and cache them in two directories, whose names will be hashes (e.g, "6141fcbdf8d4a54de0d3ba39fe66f405"). When processing them, it will use the order given by these hashes, even if it's not the same that the one in the configuration file.

Ideally, the repositories should be processed in the order that I listed them so I could know which were going to have preference (for pillar overriding). As it is now, if there are conflicting pillars, I don't know if the ones "winning" will be those in the first repository or those in the second.

Is this the intended behaviour? Is there any workaround?

Thanks in advance!
