### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
```yaml
somegroup:
  group.present

some.example.com:
  acme.cert:
    - email: webmaster@example.com
    - group: somegroup
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run the above state file without the `group: somegroup` parameter.
2. Once the certificate is acquired (successful highstate), add the `group` parameter.
3. Highstate the minion. The module reports nothing changed, and the private key file is indeed still owned by group `root`.

### Versions Report
2018.3.2, but looking at the code suggests that it's still present in develop.
