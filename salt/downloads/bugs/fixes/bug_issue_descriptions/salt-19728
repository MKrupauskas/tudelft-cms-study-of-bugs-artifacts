Something changed in the way URLs are handled for key_url as in the downloaded key file is the HTML of the HTTP 401 response and apt-key add (obviously) fails. The configured repo is something like:

``` yaml
foo-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb https://username:{{ pillar['foo']['repo_http_auth'] }}@repo.hostname foo bar
    - key_url: https://username:{{ pillar['foo']['repo_http_auth'] }}@repo.hostname/public.key
```

The state fails with:

```
Error: key retrieval failed: apt-key add /var/cache/salt/minion/extrn_files/base/username:password@repo.hostname/public.key
```

``` bash
salt --versions-report

```

PS: also hitting #16409 on the same setup. Otherwise, unrelated as it's a SNI issue, but I don't know if HTTPS URLs are handled differently by SaltStack.
