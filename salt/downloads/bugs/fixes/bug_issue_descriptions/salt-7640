I created a state to install npm on Amazon Linux and it doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions? I can run "sudo yum install npm" just fine. npm is coming from EPEL and does not appear to be an alias.

State:

```
npm:
  pkg.installed
```

Output:

```
    State: - pkg
    Name:      npm
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: npm.
        Changes: 
```
