### Description of Issue/Question
Testing with minion filesystem local files, I am unable to get `file.managed` to trigger a state failure with a corrupted source file not matching the sha256 (or sha1) stored in a properly associated hash file. The evidence of the issue, beyond the state succeeding, are these two lines of debug output:
```
[DEBUG   ] file.extract_hash: Line '5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03  trythis' matches source '/tmp/trythis'
[DEBUG   ] file.extract_hash: Returning sha256 hash '5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03' as a match of /tmp/trythis
```
In this case, the source file's hash file has the contents `5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03` but the actual sha256 of the source file is `71573b922a87abc3fd1a957f2cfa09d9e16998567dd878a85e12166112751806`.

The bug is confirmed present on both `2016.11.6` and `2017.7` (I think my colleague was using `2017.7.2`).

### Setup
This is the repro case salt state:
```
trythis:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/trythis.copy
    - source: /tmp/trythis
    - source_hash: /tmp/trythis.shasum
```
and the rest of the details are in the next section.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
[user@machine ~]$ cat /srv/salt/test/test_file.sls
trythis:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/trythis.copy
    - source: /tmp/trythis
    - source_hash: /tmp/trythis.shasum

[user@machine ~]$ cd /tmp
[user@machine tmp]$ echo hello > trythis
[user@machine tmp]$ sha256sum trythis > trythis.shasum
[user@machine tmp]$ echo goodbye > trythis
[user@machine tmp]$ sha256sum trythis

5891b5b522d5df086d0ff0b110fbd9d21bb4fc7163af34d08286a2e846f6be03  trythis
[user@machine tmp]$ sha256sum -c trythis.shasum
