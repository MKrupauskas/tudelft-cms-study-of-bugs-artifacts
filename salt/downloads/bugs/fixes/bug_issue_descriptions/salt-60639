**Description**
For nightly builds: https://repo.saltproject.io/salt-dev/py3/amazon/2/x86_64/

And any other use of salt between tagged builds after the .0 release, the versions are wrong because the merge commit has the tag on the 2nd parent rather than the first when we merge forward.

Our versions are based on git describe which I believe just follows `HEAD^`, `HEAD^^` ... until it finds a tag, when our tags are on the `HEAD^2` of the merge commit.

I believe we need to merge the master branch into the freeze branch locally before pushing to master so the tag is on the first parent of the merge commit.  I don't think this can be done through github's `merge button` on a PR.

**Setup**
```python3 setup.py sdist```
On the salt repo currently shows that the last tag was 3003rc1, which is incorrect. The version is something like `v3003rc1+636.g008a0a7796`

**Expected behavior**
The version should be something like `v3003.1+60.g008a0a7796`
