**Description**
Big Sur uses the same output format as Catalina, but the mac softwareupdate module mistakenly uses the earlier format due to the conditional that selects which regex to use. Currently, it's looking for a minor version that exceeds the version during which the new output of the softwareupdate CLI tool was released. However, Big Sur uses a new major version.

Please see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/58247 for more details for a PR to solve this.
