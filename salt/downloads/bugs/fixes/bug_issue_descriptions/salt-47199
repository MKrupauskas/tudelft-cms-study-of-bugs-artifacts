### Description of Issue/Question

In contrast to targeting by wildcard targeting by list outputs minions twice including an error:

```
root@master:~# salt \* test.ping
syndic:
    True
minion:
    True

root@master:~# salt -L syndic,minion test.ping
syndic:
    True
minion:
    True
minion:
    Minion did not return. [No response]

root@master:~# salt -L minion test.ping
minion:
    True
minion:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

On the syndic everything works as expected:
```
root@syndic:~# salt -L minion test.ping
minion:
    True
```

The problem also prevents using lists in node groups.
