Hi,

i have a problem using salt masterless on a windows minion. I have my own modules in the `salt://_modules` dir, but they will never copied to the cache directory. 

I'm using the `salt-call --local state.highstate` command. but i don't think it performs a `saltutil.sync_all`, so the modules won't be copied. If i perform the sync_all manually, it hangs at `MinionEvent PUB socket URI: ...` like described here https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8058

OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 x64
