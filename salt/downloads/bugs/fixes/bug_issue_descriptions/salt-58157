**Description**
Since Firefox 79 and its privacy enhancement
https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/08/04/firefox-79-includes-protections-against-redirect-tracking/

It is impossible to browse the repositories contents without disable the Firefox native tracking protection.
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js is blocked.


**Setup**
Open Firefox and developer tools on https://repo.saltstack.com/py3/debian/10/amd64/


**Additional context**
Why using JS and useless things instead of a simple and efficient web server (Apache, Nginx,..) and its simple directory listing functionality ?
Since repositories have migrated on this and before Firefox 79, I must disable my uMatrix rules for just browse repositories.
This is insane.
Sorry, I'm a fan off KISS principle.
