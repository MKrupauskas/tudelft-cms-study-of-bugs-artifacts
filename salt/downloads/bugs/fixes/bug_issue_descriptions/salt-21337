We have a schedule in our pillar which is applied to `*` telling minions to highstate every 15 minutes and return the data to a returner.

After disabling this for a few minions (by adding a grain check to the `schedule.sls`) they were still being highstated every 15 minutes. 

As a test I have restarted the minion on one of the excluded machines and it properly stopped highstating while the others were still doing that.

For another minion I have tried to forcefully refresh the pillars by issuing `saltutil.refresh_pillar` which did resolve it for that. Could this be some kind of cache in the minion? Generally pillar changes are picked up automatically without needing a manual refresh, but perhaps the actual refresh does something specific when it contains a schedule?
