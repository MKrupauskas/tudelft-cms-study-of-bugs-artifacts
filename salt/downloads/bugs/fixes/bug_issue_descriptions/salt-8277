I've been experimenting with salt Windows packages. Generally, the packaging system works as documented until I'd tried to install the subversion package. Essentially, this is what I'd observed:
###### When pulling configuration:

On the minion, run `salt-call.exe pkg.install svn`. Works as expected, the subversion package is installed and can be seen in the "Uninstall or change a program" view.
###### When the salt-minion run from within a cmd session:

Also, works as expected.
###### When pushing a configuration:

On the master, run `salt 'SaltMinionWindows' pkg.install svn`. The master indicates the package is installed and to an extent the package is, i.e. the uninstall (and maybe others) registry is correctly set, files are copied to the correct location. However, the program does not appear in the "Uninstall or change a program" view.

It is quite likely there's a problem with the Windows subversion msi package, however, this doesn't explain the differences between push and pull.

Here is the subversion sls configuration file:

```
svn:
  1.8.4:
    full_name: "Subversion"
    installer: salt://win/repo/svn/Setup-Subversion-1.8.4.msi
    install_flags: "/passive /norestart /log %temp%\\svnInstall.log"
    uninstaller: salt://win/repo/svn/Setup-Subversion-1.8.4.msi
    uninstall_flags: "/passive /norestart /log %temp%\\svnUninstall.log"
    reboot: False
    msiexec: True
```

This is stored in a file called svn.sls and placed in srv/salt/win/repo/svn along with the subversion installer. The subversion installer can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32svn/files/latest/download.
