RabbitMQ's output sometimes includes warnings which need to be stripped. The current `_strip_listing_to_done` doesn't handle this case.
## Example output

```
WARNING: ignoring /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf -- location has moved to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf
Listing users ...
guest\t[administrator]
...done.
```
