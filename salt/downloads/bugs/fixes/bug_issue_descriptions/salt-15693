A broken .sls file causes a crash in salt minion which in turn causes the state to return without output.

The testcase, note the mishappen comment:

```
asd:
  user.present:
    - fullname: Asd
    - shell: /bin/bash

asd_keys:
#  ssh_auth:
#    - present
#    - user: asd
#    - source: salt://users/asd/id_rsa.pub
```

The relevant stack trace from salt-call:

```

And apologies if this is a dupe; I could not find relevant one with the time I had.
