### Description of Issue/Question

The module win_update.py used to have a method for including specific search parameters to pass to the COM object. In 389fea75, this was changed to skipping specific search parameters.

Neither way is sufficient. In fact, both methods are needed because `CreateUpdateSearcher.Search`, by default includes some types of updates and excludes others.

A sensible default is to include an empty search string, and only include skips for those that are not desired and included by default and includes for those that are desired but skipped by default.

I may put some effort into this soon, but in the meantime you must add skips for RebootRequired to see any updates.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

call `win_update.list_updates` on a machine with available updates. You'll likely get zero, because most updates do not have the RebootRequired flag set.
