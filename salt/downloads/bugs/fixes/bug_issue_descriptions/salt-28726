User home account directories are being created even when we set "createhome" to False.
In other words, the -M flag is not being passed to the "useradd" command and the directory "/home/someuser" will be created when using the following formula:

```
add_some_user:
  user.present:
    - name: someuser
    - createhome: False
```
