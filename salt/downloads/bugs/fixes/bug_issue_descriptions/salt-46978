### Description of Issue/Question
This issue started around the release of 2018.3.0. When managing a database dump in gzipped format, I get the following error if the file had been previously added through the managed state: "Unable to manage file: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byte". This happens regardless of if the file has changed or not changed since the last run. I'm using this in Vagrant to provision a copy of the database dump for additional operations, and it previously worked flawlessly.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
I use a similar file.managed state as below:

file.managed:
    - name: '/usr/share/mysql-dump/dump-dbname.sql.gz'
    - makedirs: True
    - source: salt://mysql/dump-dbname.sql.gz
    - skip_verify: True

I don't see a reason why the file needs to be read. It should just get hashed to determine if it should be copied. The error does not occur if the file does not exist prior to running the state, but happens every time I run the state after the file is created.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Run the above state.
Get error:  "Unable to manage file: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x8b in position 1: invalid start byte"
