Commit acf2d51440af97836b48adb18276df5263590f51 modified `salt/fileclient.py` to directly write out the `.body` of the response rather than a streaming handler.

This is all well & good, but the `requests` backend result does not contain a `.body`, resulting in 

```

```

The result is actually in `.content` for a `requests` Response.

The problem is rather pressing for us because of #8177/#23617/#21985. Currently the _only_ way to get Salt's HTTP requests to use a proxy is by utilizing the `requests` backend & specifiying the environment variables.
