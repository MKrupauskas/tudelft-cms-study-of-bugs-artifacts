This issue is somewhat similar to #13389. Branches like `feature/xyz` work now, but `hotfix/v1.2.3` isn't. I get 

```
          ID: /some/dir
    Function: file.recurse
      Result: False
     Comment: Recurse failed: none of the specified sources were found
     Started: 17:10:37.892134

I am using 2014.7.0+ds-2~bpo70+1
