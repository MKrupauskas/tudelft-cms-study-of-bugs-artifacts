### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->
Fresh installation of Hyper-V Server 2019
 *(The Free Hyper-V Server, **not** Windows Server 2019 with Hyper-V Role, which can be downloaded here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-hyper-v-server-2019)*

Salt Minion 2019.2.2  Py3 Fresh Installed using https://winbootstrap.saltstack.com with the following command:

`powershell.exe -file .\bootstrap-salt.ps1 -pythonVersion 3 -minion MY-MINION-NAME -master MY-MASTER-IP`

The minion fails to start, and of course never shows up in the master.

### Setup
Stock, vanilla configuration.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Here is the output from starting up the minion in debug mode:
```
PS C:\salt> .\salt-minion-debug.bat
The salt-minion service is not started.
