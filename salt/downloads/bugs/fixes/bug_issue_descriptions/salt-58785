**Description**
salt 3002 just installed last night. woke up this morning to find all memory and most of the swap taken up. checked `ps aux | grep salt` before restarting service to get memory back. found that the maintenance processes was the only large memory hog. 



**Setup**
install 3002 and wait.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
install 3002 and have minions. 

**Expected behavior**
I have memory on my system after only a day of having a newly updated system.

**Screenshots**

the little uptick at 18:00 is when I installed 3002.
