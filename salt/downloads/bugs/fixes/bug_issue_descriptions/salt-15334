My system is Ubuntu 14.04 with salt 2014.1.10+ds-1trusty1

My minion is unresponsive though the process is running. The entire minion log is filled with the following repeating message:

```

```

I already found issue #1000 ([FreeBSD] 'salt-call state.highstate' results in: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable) but my sls files are indented correctly and other minions are running fine. What else could I check for?
