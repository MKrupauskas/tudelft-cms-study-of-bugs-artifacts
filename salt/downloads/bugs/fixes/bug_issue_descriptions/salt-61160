**Description**
The fix for https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59903 introduced a new bug that caused deployments to fail because the vt.terminal will throw an error instead of update that the client is no longer alive. This is causing SSC to not be able to deploy instances as the runner is not being returned when vt.terminal things the client is still running when it is not. 

the error not being caught is. 
```
ChildProcessError: [Errno 10] No child processes
```
