Arguably, this isn't a big deal, but better keep a reference around:

On a machine without python-yaml installed, running the salt-master (v0.16-699-g18e270d) produces the following exception. Notable is the last line. The

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/madduck/code/salt/scripts/salt-master", line 6, in <module>
    from salt.scripts import salt_master

ImportError: No module named yaml
Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in <function _removeHandlerRef at 0xcc99b0> ignored
```

The function `_removeHandlerRef` appears to be defined within the logging framework. I suspect that somewhere, Salt is passing unchecked data (`None` in this case) to the logging module.
