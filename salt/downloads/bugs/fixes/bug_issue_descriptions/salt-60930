Description
Found an issue with using the library liblvm.a from AIX v7.1 builds on AIX 7.2

Running the command

salt-call --local cmd.run "varyonvg testvg"
[WARNING ] The tools 'dmidecode' and 'lspci' failed to execute because they do not exist on the system of the user running this instance or the user does not have the necessary permissions to execute them. Grains output might not be accurate.
[ERROR   ] Command 'varyonvg testvg' failed with return code: 3
[ERROR   ] output: 0516-316 varyonvg: Unable to find volume group testvg in the Device
        Configuration Database.
local:
    0516-316 varyonvg: Unable to find volume group testvg in the Device
          Configuration Database.
But when run on AIX v7.2 this causes an error as described in https://bugzilla.eng.vmware.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2820595#c27

    ----------
    cmd.run:
        Could not load program varyonvg:
        Symbol resolution failed for varyonvg because:
                Symbol lvm_change_vgstate (number 56) is not exported from dependent
                  module /opt/salt/run/liblvm.a(shr.o).
        Examine .loader section symbols with the 'dump -Tv' command.
    test.version:
        3002.1
During a customer call to help resolve the issue it was discovered that the version of liblvm.a which is part of bos.rte.lvm is different between the versions of AIX v7.1 and v7.2 which is causing the issue.

Setup
salt-call --local cmd.run "varyonvg testvg"
