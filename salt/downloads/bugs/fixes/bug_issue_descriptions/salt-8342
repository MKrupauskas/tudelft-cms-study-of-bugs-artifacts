I'm starting to experiment with blockreplace which I found to be a great addition to salt but the documentation required a bit of trial and error. Eventually I got it working, but I'd like to propose some changes to it, mainly to the docs (I haven't submitted a PR because I'm not entirely sure of what I'm proposing is correct):
- I believe the require_in parameter is wrongly pointing to `file: foobar-config-block-{{ myvar }}` ([here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/78662d270b53150573e431a2c019068d22ff0874/salt/states/file.py#L1904)). Instead, from my understanding, it should be `hosts-config-block-{{ myvar }}`.
- Wouldn't it be possible to "accumulate" changed by pointing the require_in clause to a given ID and simply have salt come up with a generated accumulator name? From the look of it, it doesn't really matter what name you give it anyway, since it ends up not being used anywhere on the `blockreplace` state.
- After running highstate, I got back a (successful) return with an "Invalid Changes data" string ([here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/57210ce64a60a9f8e90b63fdf8efb6dac92e6335/salt/output/highstate.py#L125)). It appears to be a bug in the diff return format, since the content shown is correct. 

Thanks for this slick feature!
