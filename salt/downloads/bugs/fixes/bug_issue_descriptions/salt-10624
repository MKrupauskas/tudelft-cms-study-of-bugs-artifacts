Trying to issue commands on the command line, getting this error:

```
[root@dufresne ~]# salt-call nova.flavor_list profile=rackspace
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py:166: DeprecationWarning: This minion received a job where kwargs were passed as string'd args, which has been deprecated. This functionality will be removed in Salt Boron.
  'This minion received a job where kwargs were passed as '
...SNIP...
```

Talking to @thatch45, this message should not appear when passing in kwargs like this on the command line; it is meant for people programmatically passing in kwargs as args.
