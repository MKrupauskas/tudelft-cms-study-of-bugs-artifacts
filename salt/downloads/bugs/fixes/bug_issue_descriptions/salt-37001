### Description of Issue/Question

first it says the checksum cannot verified, does not correspond
(it was working before for many machines and I did not change my script)

I tried source_hash_update=True, but it gives me an error

skip_verify: true gives an error saying it's an invalid option but this would really be usefull

I am supposed to add a machine to my prod today and now I am stuck, so it's quiet an urgent issue
worst case I could install the whole thing manualy, but then what's the point of relying on SALT ???

is there no way to install salt from the bootstrap script without regression ?

thanks
