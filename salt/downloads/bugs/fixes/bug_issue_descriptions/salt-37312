### Description of Issue/Question

If you pass arguments like --no-color or --failhard, they do not overwrite settings in /etc/salt/master which could be hard coded to True or False.
### Setup

set the following in /etc/salt/master

```
failhard: False
color: True
```

Then run `salt --no-color --failhard \* state.apply`  an salt will ignore the cli arguments and instead use the master config options.
### Versions Report

I have seen this behavior as far back as 2015.5
