Steps to reproduce:
1. Set up client_acl in /etc/salt/master:

```
    client_acl:
      celery:
        - .*
```
1. Log in as celery
2. set LOGNAME environmental variable to e.g. root.
3. run a salt command, e.g. `salt '*' test.ping`.

Expected result: salt command runs correctly.

Actual result: "Failed to authenticate, is this user permitted to execute commands?"

This is an issue for me, because I am using LocalClient inside a [celery](www.celeryproject.org/) job. Celery is being started at init with the `--uid` option. This changes the uid to that of the celery user but leaves LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME environmental variables as "root".

I will file a bug with celery also, but in the spirit of "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others" salt should run correctly in this situation.
