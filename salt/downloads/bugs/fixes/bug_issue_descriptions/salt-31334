If you use win_servermanager to install or remove a windows feature the name returned will be chopped if it contains a space.

For example:

```
salt '*' win_servermanager.remove Telnet-Client
```

returns:

```
slee_build_win64:
    ----------
    ExitCode:
        Success
    FeatureResult:
        {Telnet
    RestartNeeded:
        No
    Success:
        True
    message:


        Success       : True
        RestartNeeded : No
        FeatureResult : {Telnet Client}
        ExitCode      : Success
```

FeatureResult should contain the full name `Telnet Client`
Should also have it remove the braces `{}`
