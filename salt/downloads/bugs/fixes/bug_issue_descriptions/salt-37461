### Description of Issue/Question

If you attempt to use GitFS with a private key that does not have a trailing newline you get the following cryptic error message:

    failed to authenticate ssh session waiting for userauth response

However, the exact same private key file works with both `ssh -i` and `git`. There is little information about this error on Google search. Would it be possible to either improve error reporting or append a trailing newline if one does not exist?
