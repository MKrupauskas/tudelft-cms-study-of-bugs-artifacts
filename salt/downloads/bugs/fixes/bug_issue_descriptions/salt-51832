### Description of Issue/Question
I have used git for ext_pillar for a while now and when upgrading to 2019.2.0 no pillars get rendered for me. As a quick test I downgraded to 2018.3.4 and everything works as expected.

ext_pillar config:
```yaml
ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - master git@github.com:user/pillar.git:
       - root: pillar
       - privkey: /root/.ssh/id_rsa
       - pubkey: /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This straight up doesn't load up the pillar top.sls if I have root: specified. If I remove the option and put top.sls in git "root" it then loads it and I get error that now it can't find the SLS (as expected since the path is not relative anymore to the specified root in the config which I've been using).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Configure exit_pillar git pillar with root: and top.sls in the root.
