Hi 

With ext_pillar and the behavior  I do not agree why does it creates this kind of url?

The "branches" directory is not necessary in the url!

Config:

```
ext_pillar:
   - svn: HEAD http://svnserver/webdav/svn-salttest root=pillar

```

The output comes with "branches" why?

```
Could not find http://svnserver/webdav/svn-salttest/branches/HEAD/pillar
```
