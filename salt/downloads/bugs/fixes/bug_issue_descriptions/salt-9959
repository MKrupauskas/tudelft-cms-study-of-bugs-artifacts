On Debian 7, service.running does not correctly report an inability to start a service.

Using the following sls:

```
python-apt:
  pkg:
    - latest

wheezy-updates:
  pkgrepo:
    - managed
    - humanname: wheezy-updates
    - name: 'deb http://mirrors.kernel.org/debian wheezy-updates main contrib'
    - dist: wheezy-updates
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wheezy-updates.list
    - require:
      - pkg: python-apt

clamav-freshclam:
  pkg:
    - latest
    - fromrepo: wheezy-updates
  service:
    - running
    - enable: True

clamav-daemon:
  pkg:
    - installed
  service:
    - running
```

Here is the minion output:

```
[ERROR   ] Command 'service clamav-daemon status' failed with return code: 3
[ERROR   ] output: clamd is not running ... failed!
[INFO    ] Executing command 'service clamav-daemon start' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] output: Clamav signatures not found in /var/lib/clamav ... failed!
Please retrieve them using freshclam ... failed!
Then run '/etc/init.d/clamav-daemon start' ... failed!
[INFO    ] {'clamav-daemon': True}
```

Actual output on salt master:

```
----------
          ID: clamav-daemon
    Function: service.running
      Result: True
     Comment: Started Service clamav-daemon
     Changes:
              ----------
              clamav-daemon:
                  True
```

Expected output, somewhere on the comment's field:

```
[...]
Clamav signatures not found in /var/lib/clamav ... failed!
Please retrieve them using freshclam ... failed!
Then run '/etc/init.d/clamav-daemon start' ... failed!

This has happened with other packages as well (elasticsearch) and it has always been a complicated problem to debug due to misleading reporting status. Originally mentioned on issue #5894.
