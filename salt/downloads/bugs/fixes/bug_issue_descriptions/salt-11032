I changed the log level to debug on a windows client. Restarting this service, I don't see any messages added to the log. 

However, if I start salt from the command line, even without the flags `-l debug` now everything is logged into the logfile with a very detailed level. That is exactly what I want. But I don't want to start salt from the command line. I was the service to log verbose messages.
