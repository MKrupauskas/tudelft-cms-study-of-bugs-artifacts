### Description of Issue/Question

`salt/states/user.py` cannot cope with Umlauts. Either the input utf-8 type (from state file / pillar) gets lost, or there is a codec screwup somewhere.

```
          ID: user-present-umlaut
    Function: user.present
        Name: umlaut
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/tmp/.erlacher_f62e6b__salt/salt/state.py", line 1560, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/tmp/.erlacher_f62e6b__salt/salt/states/user.py", line 384, in present
                  ret['comment'] += '{0}: {1}\n'.format(key, val)
              UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xfc' in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)
