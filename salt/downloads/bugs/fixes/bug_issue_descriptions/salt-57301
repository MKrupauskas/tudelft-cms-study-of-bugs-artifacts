**Description**
I wanted to check what `pkg.upgrade` would do, so I ran it with `test=true`. However, it actually did the upgrade.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Have some apt packages pending upgrade, and run ```sudo salt '*' pkg.upgrade test=true```

**Expected behavior**
No changes should be made.

**Versions Report**
N.B. this is the version now, after running the upgrade.
