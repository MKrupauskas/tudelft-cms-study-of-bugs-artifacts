### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

CentOS 7 + EPEL repo
Saltstack repo enabled and salt\* related packages installed
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try installing the latest zeromq from EPEL, that came out earlier today and you'll get errors like so:

```
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks

 You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
 You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest
```

I get the same results with 2016.3.1 as it uses the same python-zmq.

Could you update/rebuilt python-zmq against the latest zeromq and provide that in your repos or if not, make the epoch on the one provided from saltstack higher than 0?  For now, I'm excluding zeromq from EPEL to avoid issues.
