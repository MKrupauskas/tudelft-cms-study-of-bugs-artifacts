**Description**
Adding users or groups to external_auth does not allow custom python scripts to use salt-key commands without sudo. Instead a key error is thrown:
```
'Exception occurred in wheel key.list: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 374, in low\n    data[\'return\'] = func(*args, **kwargs)\n  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/wheel/key.py", line 69, in list_\n    return skey.list_status(match)\n  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/key.py", line 564, in list_status\n    for fn_ in salt.utils.data.sorted_ignorecase(os.listdir(pre)):\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: \'/etc/salt/pki/master/minions_pre\'\n'
```
It is possible I am wrong but my understanding of the [docs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/eauth/access_control.html) is that according to the line:  

> external_auth is useful for salt-api or for making your own scripts that use Salt's Python API

I should be able to run the salt-key command via the salt python api without sudo or root if my name (or group) is configured to do so. See setup below where I added my name AND my group. I have also tried only my group, and only my user with salt-master restarts in between.

**Setup**
Add external auth to your salt master config file (or master.d directory). 
``` YAML
external_auth:
  pam:
    jhanafin:
      - .*
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'
      - '@jobs'
    saltadmins%:
      - .*
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'
      - '@jobs'
```
SELinux is also disabled

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Pull up a python3 shell on the master and run:
``` python3
import salt.client
import salt.wheel
# Load caller (think cmd)
local = salt.client.LocalClient()
# Load Wheel (think key)
opts = salt.config.master_config('/etc/salt/master')
wheel = salt.wheel.WheelClient(opts)
# Attempt to get unaccepted keys
wheel.cmd('key.list', ['pre'])
``` 

**Expected behavior**
wheel.cmd('key.list', ['pre']) should return a dictionary.
