We currently have libcloud listed in requirements.txt ... this should probably be clarified as it's only a hard dep for salt-cloud, not for, say, salt-minion or salt-master.

Move it to opt-requirements.txt or annotate it better where it is?
Thoughts?  I wanted an opinion rather than blindly raising a PR for either option.
