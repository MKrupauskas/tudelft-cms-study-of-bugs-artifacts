**Description**
When the Juniper native minion code was merged into the master branch, the --proxyid check was removed since the Juniper native minion leverages the proxy code to communicate with the ncclient and in turn the Junos OS.  This code needs to be returned and bounded by is_junos platform check.

salt/cli/daemons.py
```diff
 --       if not self.values.proxyid:
--            self.error("salt-proxy requires --proxyid")
++        ## allow for native minion
```
