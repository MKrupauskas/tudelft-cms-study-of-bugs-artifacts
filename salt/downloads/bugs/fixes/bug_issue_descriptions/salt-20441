OS: Windows Server 2012 R2
Salt: 2014.7.1

This is a very minor bug.  Only occurs when running test=Test.  No issues when performing a normal state run.

```
ssh-key:
  file.managed:
    - name: {{ salt['cmd.run']('echo %tmp%') }}\id_rsa
    - contents_pillar: mainweb:github_private_key
```

```
          ID: ssh-key
    Function: file.managed
        Name: C:\Windows\TEMP\id_rsa
      Result: False
