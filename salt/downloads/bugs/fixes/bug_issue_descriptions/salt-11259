i tried to migrate a KVM VM v3 created manually using libvirt from kvm3 to kvm4:

<pre>
pille@salt-master ~ % time sudo salt-run virt.migrate v3 kvm4
20140316113522319774
sudo salt-run virt.migrate v3 kvm4  0.64s user 0.30s system 8% cpu 10.606 total
</pre> 


i've enabled <code>virt.tunnel: True</code> and there's no firewall in place.
i see that on kvm4 the v3-image file is created as a sparse file.
nothing more happens. no useful info in any logs.

tcpdump captures two packets on port 16514:
1) >SYN
2) <RST

so the connection never gets established.

pille@salt-master ~ % time sudo salt-run virt.list
