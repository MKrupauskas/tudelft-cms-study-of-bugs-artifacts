As i understand the solution, i really feel it a bit too rude/much to totally fail here, a lot of states that we use change a bit overtime but are mostly compatible.

Shall we just log something (like with an error level) rather than failing ?
This is also problematic if we have duplicated a lot of states which ... contain 'non blocking' errors :D
