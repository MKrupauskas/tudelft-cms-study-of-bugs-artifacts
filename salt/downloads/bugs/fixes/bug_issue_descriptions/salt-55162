### Description of Issue
salt version: 2019.2.0
I wanna print some unicode strings in my python3 script, 
but `UnicodeEncodeError` encountered when I called that script by `salt-call --local cmd.run`
I can reproduce this problem by a simplified command:
```bash
salt-call --local cmd.run 'python3 -c "print(\"\")"'
```
### Setup
```bash
grep -Ev '^#|^$' /etc/salt/minion
master: xxxxxxx
master_port: xxxx
master_finger: xxxxxx
# I just changed these 3 fields
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Command: `salt-call --local cmd.run 'python3 -c "print(\"\")"'`
Output: 
```python
