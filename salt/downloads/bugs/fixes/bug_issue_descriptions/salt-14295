From doc:

http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.pip_state.html#salt.states.pip_state.removed

There is no explanation for `requirements` arg, then I tried to pass a path to requirements file

```
requests:
  pip:
    - removed
    - requirements: /tmp/nana

# cat /tmp/nana
raven==5.0.0
requests==2.3.0
```

Result

```
local:
----------
          ID: requests
    Function: pip.removed
      Result: True
     Comment: Package was successfully removed.
     Changes:
              ----------
              requests:
                  Removed
----------
```

Debug log

```
[INFO    ] Executing command "/usr/local/bin/pip2 uninstall -y --requirement='/tmp/nana' requests" in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] Command "/usr/local/bin/pip2 uninstall -y --requirement='/tmp/nana' requests" failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] stdout: Double requirement given: requests==2.3.0 (from -r /tmp/nana (line 2)) (already in requests, name='requests')
Storing debug log for failure in /root/.pip/pip.log

```

Since pip.removed execution module receive pkgs as arg, pip.removed state module only passes "name", then I guess author does not want to support remove multiple pkgs, therefore, the code need to be fix or the doc should be updated and remove un-used options for pip.removed state module.
