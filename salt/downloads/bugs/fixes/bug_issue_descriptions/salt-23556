This is incorrect as the mac address is different after a reboot, causing the dummy interface to not come up.

The fix here is to fix the templates that lay down /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-$interface_name

I'll send in a PR to fix this soonish, but this bug is just for tracking. cc: @junster1
