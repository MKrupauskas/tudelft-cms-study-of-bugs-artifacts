### Description of Issue/Question

I have a simple roles system using grains. It's not your standard list of roles but a series of roles that can optionally have a list of specific environments/systems that the role applies to - the grains data looks like this:

```
roles:
  web_server:
     - productionA
     - systemTestB
  database_server:
  some_other_thing:
```

To allow me to modify or add new roles (with or without the environment/systems) I have found that **grains.append** works beautifully with its recent support for nested lists: so long as I supply the necessary **convert=True** argument. The only fly in the ointment is that nulls/empty-lists get converted to a list item too, and there seems no point/purpose/logic to having a list item of null/None (unless someone explicitly asks for that). Therefore running this command (in the context of the above grain data):

`salt 'minion' grains.append 'roles:database_server [envA, envB, envC] True`

Results in this:

```
local:
    ----------
    roles:
        ----------
        web_server:
         - productionA
         - systemTestB
        database_server:
        - None
        - envA
        - envB
        - envC
        some_other thing:
```

There seem to be quite a few different conditions where you can end up with **None** list items although I'm not yet sure if this issue is only present in **append**. For my scenario its not a big problem as I'm only checking for the existence of roles but I can imagine this would be a horrible pain for other situations.
