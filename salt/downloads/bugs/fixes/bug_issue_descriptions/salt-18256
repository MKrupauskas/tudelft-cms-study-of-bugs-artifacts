If you configure the reactor to run on any event that is generated by firing a job to a minion (job ret, job pub, etc.) then the reactor will infinitely recurse on itself. This is because the cmd_async function (which it uses for firing the job to the minion) has no mechanism to disable firing an event-- meaning the reactor will react on events that originated from the reactor.
