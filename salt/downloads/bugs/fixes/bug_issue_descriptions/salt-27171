While testing the MySQL returner on Ubuntu 10.04, the minion error log reported connection failures to a MySQL database that is not configured to use SSL.  As specified in the documentation, the following configuration values were set to None:

```
mysql.ssl_ca: None
mysql.ssl_cert: None
mysql.ssl_key: None
```

In the _get_serv function of the mysql returner, the MySQL connection specifies the ssl argument (line 220).

```
        # An empty ssl_options dictionary passed to MySQLdb.connect will
        # effectively connect w/o SSL
...
            conn = MySQLdb.connect(host=_options.get('host'),
                                   user=_options.get('user'),
                                   passwd=_options.get('pass'),
                                   db=_options.get('db'),
                                   port=_options.get('port'),
                                   ssl=ssl_options)
```

Removal of "ssl=ssl_options" corrects the issue and the module non-SSL connections work as suggested by the documentation.

The supposition is that the presence of the "ssl" argument is sufficient to trigger MySQLdb's import of the OpenSSL libraries, resulting in a failure.  While these libraries are likely to be relatively up to date in recent releases of the operating system, disabling SSL for MySQL should remain a functional alternative.
