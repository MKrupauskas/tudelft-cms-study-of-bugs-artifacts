having multiple issues with salt-minion 2015.8.3-219.3 from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:python/SLE_11_SP3/devel:languages:python.repo.  First, a new code dependency on python-singledispatch was added but the package was not added to the salt packages as a dependency.  After getting past that, there is a missing dependency on backports_abc that does not appear to exist in the SuSE repos.
