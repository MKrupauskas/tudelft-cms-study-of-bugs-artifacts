Since upgrading to saltstack 2015.8.0, the `git.latest` function is returning incorrect results when the first commit on top of a repo is not the same as the origin repo.

Here is the local repo:

```
3ec6283 CSparr     2015-06-12 00:12 o [master] ignore bundle dir
b4174e4 Lifepillar 2015-09-20 20:28 o {origin/master} {origin/HEAD} Fix typo in pathogen#surround()
```

And here is the salt failure message.

```

     Comment: Repository would be updated from 3ec6283 to b4174e4, but this is not a fast-forward merge. Set 'force_reset' to True to force this update.

Commit `b4174e4` is already in the local repo, but salt thinks that it needs to be the HEAD of the repo. The HEAD of a local repo does _not_ need to be the same as the remote for it to be up to date with the remote.
