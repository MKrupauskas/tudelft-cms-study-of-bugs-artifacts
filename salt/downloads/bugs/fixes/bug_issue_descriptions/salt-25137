i'm using salt-master 2015.5.2, and i have the following state:

```
ks db_sync:
  cmd.run:
    - name: keystone-manage db_sync
    - require_in:
      - keystone: ks admin tenant

ks admin tenant:
  keystone.tenant_present:
    - name: admin
    - connection_token: <REDACTED>
    - connection_endpoint: http://<REDACTED>:35357/v2.0
```

however, when i run it i get:

```
$ salt node1 state.sls crap
