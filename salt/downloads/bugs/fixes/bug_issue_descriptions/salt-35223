Some of the core grains do not populate properly after changes in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/bc73db071a84a61b5711018266ba1d1599096c56 were implemented. 

One of the  broken grain is `osmajorrelease` whose type has been changed from `string` to `int` causing the following state to fail:

State:

```
root@nmadhok.local:/srv/salt# cat sample-state.sls 
{% set osMajorRelease = grains['osmajorrelease'][0] %}

{% if grains['os_family'] == "RedHat" and osMajorRelease == '6'  %}
echo 'I am RHEL6':
  cmd.run
{% endif %}
```

Error:

```
