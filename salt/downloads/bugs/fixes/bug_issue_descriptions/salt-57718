**Description**
Trying to use `grains.delkey` or `grains.delval` on a structured value results in this message
> The key 'foo' exists but is a dict or a list. Use 'force=True' to overwrite.

However, neither function accepts this argument
> The following keyword arguments are not valid: force=True

Trying to workaround by force-setting back to a string, and the `grains.delkey` reports no errors, but the key hasn't been deleted.
Also tried with `saltutil.refresh_grains` between each step, with no difference.

The only solution I found was to edit  `/etc/salt/grains`, restart the minion and then call `saltutil.refresh_grains`.

**Setup**
```
salt-call grains.set foo bar
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
```
salt-call grains.delkey foo  # fails
salt-call grains.delkey foo force=True  # fails

salt-call grains.set foo bar force=True  # succeeds
salt-call grains.delkey foo  # "succeeds"
salt-call grains.ls | grep foo  # shows a match
```

**Expected behavior**

Either:
 - the grain is deleted as before
 - the `force=True` allows it to be deleted
