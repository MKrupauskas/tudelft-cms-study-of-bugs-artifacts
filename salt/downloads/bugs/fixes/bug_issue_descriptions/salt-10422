The ~/.salt_token is created with a 644 mask, which makes it readable by all others users on the system. This is insecure. Make sure it is in 'rw------'

Side note : on ubuntu when a user creates a token, running salt as root will pick it up (since $HOME of root is $HOME of user), which is confusing  (suddenly as root we get authentication failures). The inverse is true too (user generates a token, user get authentication errors).
