"freebsd" is a valid minion ID. In the example below, "FreeBSD" times out, whereas a completely invalid minion ID returns the correct error. I would suggest either be case insensitive or return the same error.

$ salt --version
salt 2014.1.0-7315-g8ae3268 (Hydrogen)
$ salt freebsd test.ping
freebsd:
    True
$ salt FreeBSD test.ping
$ salt BOGUS test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
