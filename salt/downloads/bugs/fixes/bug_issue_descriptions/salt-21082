With the following minion configuration:

``` sls
master:
  - salt.mydomain.com
  - 24.25.26.28

master_type: failover
```

If the first server cannot be resolved by DNS, the minion continuously logs

```
DNS lookup of 'salt.mydomain.com' failed.
Master hostanme: 'salt.mydomain.com' not found. Retrying in 30 seconds
```

It never fails over to the second entry.
