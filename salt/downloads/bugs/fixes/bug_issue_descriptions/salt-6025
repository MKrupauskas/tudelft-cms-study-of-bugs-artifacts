The following should work to install your packages locally (ala `python setup.py develop` see [pip docs](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/logic.html#editable-installs)):

```
local_package_install:
    pip.installed:
        - editable: /dir/to/package
```

which should call the corresponding `pip` command

```
pip install --editable=/dir/to/package
```

But `pip.installed` always expects a valid `name` parameter and only empties it if a requirements file is supplied ([here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/pip.py#L112)).
