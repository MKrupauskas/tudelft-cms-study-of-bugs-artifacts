There are two issues with join_domain in win_system.py.  First, the quoting of the password is not working correctly.  Second, Windows 2012 R2 is returning a code of 2 when an OU is specified.  This isn't documented anywhere officially, but I've found reference on the Internet that it means "bad OU or OU not supported."
