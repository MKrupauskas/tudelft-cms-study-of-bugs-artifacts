**Description**
If you are able to get ansible gate to run. which is a big if right now. It doesn't seem to work with 3002 or 3003 as it is not passing the value of any args to the system.module. and has str errors in 3000 

**Setup**
```
salt-call ansible.system.ping 
```

will return ping: pong under normal circumstances. 

but if you pass data='string' it will respond with string. 

however currently if you pass data='hello' to ansible.system.ping you will still get pong. 

After putting some logging into the ansiblegate module that showed what the args values were. they were blank dicts. nothing in them. 

**Expected behavior**
args passed to ansiblegate are passed to the ansible modules
