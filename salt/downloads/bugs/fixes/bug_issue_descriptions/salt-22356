Hi,

This issue is the same as/related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/9984 but it was closed.

Today I tried to remove package on Ubuntu 14.04 when it had been removed already, but it failed. This time the package is openjdk-7-jre. salt is Helium (2014.7.2) and this failed on 2015.2.0rc2  too.

SLS:

```
remove stock java:
  pkg:
    - removed
    - pkgs:
      - openjdk-7-jre
```

And the error output is :

```
