### Description of Issue/Question

An `AttributeError` is raised accessing the `name` attribute of the unicode string `new_name`

It seems like the code in `salt/spm/pkgfiles/local.py` mistakenly tries to get this attribute twice in the `install_file` function (mirroring the pattern used to get `name` from the `member` object).

### Setup

Install from a configured SPM

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
