Not sure exactly why this is occuring, however when I install the Win32OpenSSL-1_0_1j.exe, and copy the installed binaries into C:\Python27, then it works.

I tried to open the dll with DUMPBIN, to see if the HEADERs could give me any indication as to what was going on ( 32bit vs 64bit... I am running 32bit ), I got this error message:  LINK : warning LNK4094: 'libeay32.dll' is an MS-DOS executable;

I can only assume that the file that you are including in the install is corrupted or wrong.
