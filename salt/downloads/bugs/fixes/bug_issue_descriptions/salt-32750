### Description of Issue/Question

If minion is started when master is down it reports about an exception occured in the multiprocessing logging queue and hangs.
### Setup

``` yaml
master:
    localhost
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Don't start master
2. Start minion and wait 1-3 `** Restarting minion **` messages
3. Result:

```
[WARNING ] ** Restarting minion **
[INFO    ] waiting random_reauth_delay 2s
[WARNING ] An exception occurred in the multiprocessing logging queue thread: [Errno 3] No such process
```

After this minion stays not responsive and if master is back it doesn't connects to.
