### Description of Issue/Question

state file.line with mode=insert doesn't seem to work for this use-case. I just get `No changes needed to be made` 

I can use mode=ensure, but that ends up only allowing me to manage a single line and subsequent file.line states with mode=ensure replace the previous line that was managed.

I attempted escaping the various "special" characters in the `match` strings for `insert_line_one` and `insert_line_six` but that didn't help. 

If I switch `after` to `'.*'` for `insert_line_one` and `insert_line_six` then the lines will be inserted but not where I wanted them. 

I think it has something to do with a check that is trying to match a line in the similar location to where I'm attempting to insert `<testing type="some">onetwothree</testing>` and returning a false positive which leads to it skipping the insert. If I remove `<testing type="that">threefourfive</testing>` from between `<one>` and `</one>` lines then `insert_line_one` will work, but `insert_line_six` will still say `No changes needed to be made` because now its getting another false positive match and skipping the insert.

`insert_line_simple` and `insert_line_simple_again` show that it has no problem inserting a line without the xml attribute ` type="xxxx"` in the `content` or `match`

I'm at a loss to submit a PR for this, it's preventing me from using `file.line`, so I've resorted to a hacky workaround with `file.replace` as it's less hastle than attempting a fix.

Any clues @isbm ?

### Setup
/root/testfile:
```xml
<test>
  <one>
    <testing type="that">threefourfive</testing>
  </one>
</test>
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
sls:
```sls
insert_line_one:
  file.line:
    - name   : /root/testfile
    - content: <testing type="some">onetwothree</testing>
    - mode   : insert
    - after  : <one>
    - match  : '<testing type="some">.*</testing>'
    - indent : True

insert_line_six:
  file.line:
    - name   : /root/testfile
    - content: <testing type="thing">sixseveneight</testing>
    - mode   : insert
    - after  : <one>
    - match  : '<testing type="thing">.*</testing>'
    - indent : True

insert_line_simple:
  file.line:
    - name   : /root/testfile
    - content: <testing>simple</testing>
    - mode   : insert
    - before : <one>
    - match  : '<testing>.*</testing>'
    - indent : True

insert_line_simple_again:
  file.line:
    - name   : /root/testfile
    - content: <testing>simple</testing>
    - mode   : insert
    - after  : <one>
    - match  : '<testing>.*</testing>'
    - indent : True
```

### Expected result
```xml
<test>
  <testing>simple</testing>
  <one>
  <testing>simple again</testing>
    <testing type="thing">sixseveneight</testing>
    <testing type="some">onetwothree</testing>
    <testing type="that">threefourfive</testing>
  </one>
</test>
```

### Actual result
```xml
<test>
  <testing>simple</testing>
  <one>
  <testing>simple again</testing>
    <testing type="that">threefourfive</testing>
  </one>
</test>
```
