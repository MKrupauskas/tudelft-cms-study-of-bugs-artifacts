So, with great glee, and furious happyness, I rolled my vagrant installation up to 2015.5.0, woohoo! but then, adding a salt returner job, even the ones from the documentation don't seem to actually be doing anything... :\ it's the default PPA install from the saltstack PPA. The only modifications to the minion configuration is to set the id (hostname), and the master (in this case, localhost), and a handful of small changes as follows : 

```
master:
    - 127.0.0.1
id: vm.vagrant.int
log_level_logfile: info
tcp_keepalive: True
tcp_keepalive_idle: 300
tcp_keepalive_cnt: -1
tcp_keepalive_intvl: -1
```

The versions are as follows:

```
root@vm:/# salt-master --version
salt-master 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
root@vm:/# salt-minion --version
salt-minion 2015.5.0 (Lithium)
```

I list, add, list, and nothing... 

```
root@vm:/# salt-call schedule.list show_all=true
local:
    schedule:
      schedule: {}
root@vm:/# salt-call schedule.add really_cool_job function=test.ping seconds=3600
local:

        Added job: really_cool_job to schedule.
    result:
        True
root@vm:/# salt-call schedule.list show_all=true
local:
    schedule:
      schedule: {}
```

Oddly, I noticed I have two schedule files... neither I added. 

```
root@vm:/# ls -alF /etc/salt/minion.d/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 May 13 18:46 ./
drwxr-xr-x 10 root root 4096 May 13 18:26 ../
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  100 May 13 18:26 _schedule.conf
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   25 May 13 21:45 schedule.conf
root@vm:/# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/schedule.conf
schedule:
  schedule: {}
root@vm:/# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf
schedule:
  __mine_interval: {function: mine.update, jid_include: true, maxrunning: 2, minutes: 60}
```

Did I miss something?
