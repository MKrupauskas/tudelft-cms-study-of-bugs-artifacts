On windows XP, the salt-minion service doesn't start after installation. I tried to launch it by hand, and it returned "The system cannot execute the specified program". I tried to find python and did not find it. 

After installing python2.7 from python.org the salt-minion seems to run fine.

Can provide more details if needed.
