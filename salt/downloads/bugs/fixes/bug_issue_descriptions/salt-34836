### Description of Issue/Question

When attempting to run `salt 'win2*' ip.set_dhcp_ip 'Local Area Connection'` it returns the following:

```
win2012:
    ----------
    DHCP enabled:
        Yes
    Interface:
        Local Area Connection
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

This message was confusing because it states that DHCP enabled is yes for the Local Areas connection interface, when actually I do not have a Local Area Connection interface. As shown in the code [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/win_ip.py#L325) it always report back yes. I think some logic added to here would be useful to check to ensure an interface exists and return an a better error message.
### Setup
1. windows minion
2. run the module:

```
  ch3ll@localhost  ~  sudo salt 'win2*' ip.set_dhcp_ip 'Local Area Connection'
win2012:
    ----------
    DHCP enabled:
        Yes
    Interface:
        Local Area Connection
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```
