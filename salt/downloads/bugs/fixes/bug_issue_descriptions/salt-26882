Using the state `npm.bootstrap` fails when NPM isn't installed yet:

```
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1161, in _thread_return

```

It doesn't help adding a `require` statement on the `npm` package to prevent this - this looks more like an issue in the module which blindly tries to run `npm` without properly handling its absence.
