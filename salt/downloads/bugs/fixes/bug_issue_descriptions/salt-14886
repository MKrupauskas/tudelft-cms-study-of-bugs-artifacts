I made a mistake in indenting of service/watch clause and the error was not useful for debugging the problem.

```
extend:
  icinga:
    service:
      - watch:
      - file: /some/path
      - file: /some/other/path
```

resulted in error:

```
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
Passed invalid arguments: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```
