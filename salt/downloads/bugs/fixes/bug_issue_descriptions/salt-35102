Installed the new mac os x pkg 2016.3.1 from repo.saltstack.com when trying to do any pkg.\* related cmds it comes up with a few lines of error output that are not really related to salt.

```
salt-call pkg.list_pkgs
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/bin/plutil -convert xml1 -o - -- "/Library/LaunchDaemons/.com.bomgar.bomgar-ps-5370CFCC-1399963037.helper/mac_service_helper.sh"' failed with return code: 1

```

(Note: it does actually proceed to do the requested pkg. action, but the errors need looking at and removing.)

salt errors and warning:

```
[ERROR   ] Exception raised when processing __virtual__ function for mac_system. Module will not be loaded not well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 0

```

I think "some" helper function somewhere inside of salt tries reading and interpreting a file called 'mac_service_helper.sh' but the current installer pkg does not install a file by that name  that I can find. 

However our Mac s have a remote support agent installed that has such a file on the disk by default. 

As can be seen by:

`locate mac_service_helper.sh`

```
/Library/LaunchDaemons/.com.bomgar.bomgar-ps-5478B13B-1466047527.helper/mac_service_helper.sh
/Users/Shared/bomgar-scc-20141128-173035.app/Contents/Resources/mac_service_helper.sh
```
