Today I was trying to deploy an environment using salt-cloud (0.8.9) and found this error when the ami-id was invalid.

Error: There was a query error: Host for new master systest-master was not found, aborting map

We should improve this kind of messages to notify the user where is the error exactly.

I have to test this in with HEAD.
