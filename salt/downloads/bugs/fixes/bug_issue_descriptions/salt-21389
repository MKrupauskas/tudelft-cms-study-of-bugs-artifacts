--to-source is another argument that needs to appear after --jump. (For SNAT.) It's currently provided out of order.

```
          ID: dmz-out
    Function: iptables.append
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to set iptables rule for dmz-out.
              Attempted rule was /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING  --to-source 10.0.0.148 --source 10.0.1.43/32 --out eth0 --jump SNAT for ipv4

Given that iptables is somewhat pluggable with kernel modules, and order matters because arguments like --jump SNAT add new valid parameters, would it maybe make sense to allow the ordering in the state to be explicit? For example, something like

``` yaml
  - proto:
    - arg: tcp
    - dest-port: 80
  - jump:
    - arg: SNAT
    - to-source: 10.0.0.1
```

would imply that dest-port should come after --proto, and to-source should come after --jump. Basically, the set of things inside a dict should come after the dictionary key. The 'arg' key is for the argument immediately following the key.

I don't know, just a thought. In any case, --to-source needs to move after -j SNAT.
