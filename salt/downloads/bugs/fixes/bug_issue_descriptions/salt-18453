The state mysql_user shows cleartext password. Not sure if all mysql states do this; looks like mysql_query does not. (I am storing mysql password in pillar as a hash).

```
[INFO    ] Running state [root] at time 23:49:12.778174
[INFO    ] Executing state mysql_user.present for root
[ERROR   ] MySQL Error 1045: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)

"State File"

```
set_root_mysql:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: root
    - host: localhost
    - password: '{{ salt['pillar.get'](database:mysqluser') }}'
    - connection_user: root
    - connection_pass: ''
