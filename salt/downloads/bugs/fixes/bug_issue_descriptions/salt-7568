Although this is an error when using halit, I submit it here because the fix lies in salt codebase, see below.

When logging into halite while having ipv6: True in my masters config, the following error was thrown:

`Exception AttributeError: "'SREQ' object has no attribute 'poller'" in <bound method SREQ.__del__ of <salt.payload.SREQ object at 0x2deb3d0>> ignored`

When adding a try-except block in the corresponding method, everything works fine, but is probably not correctly terminating all connections. I would supply a pull request, but I don't have much of an idea regarding zmq sockets and their termination.

Not regarding this bug, but it would be nice if IPv6, although few people are using it, underwent at least the most basic testing with new features ;)
