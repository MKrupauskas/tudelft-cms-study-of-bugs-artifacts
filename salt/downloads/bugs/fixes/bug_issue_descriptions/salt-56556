### Description of Issue
While testing salt-3000.1 on py36 vs on py27 I noticed all my certificates are regenerated, including my CA! (this is absolutely not what I want, as the CA is also use for things outside of salt)

I restored backups of the 10 effected minions and double checked I was on py27 salt-3000.1 which I was, another global state.apply showed no changes, phew!

**Switching to from python 2.7 to 3.6 for salt-3000.1 results in all x509.certificate_managed states to regenerate certificates**

### Debugging done
Debugging is hard as I could not leave everything in this broken state for long.

Using pudb i stepped through the x509 state and module:
- [state] x509.certificate_managed's `current_comp == new_comp` comparison was false
- [state] x509.certificate_managed's `current_comp == new_comp` had different `Subject Hash` fields
- [module] x509.read_certificate sets this hash using: `_dec2hex(cert.get_subject().as_hash())`

Stripping this down to the value of just `cert.get_subject()`:
 - py27:
```
/C=BE/CN=Example Root CA/L=Kapellen/ST=Example/O=Example/emailAddress=certadm@example.org
```
- py36:
```
/C=BE/ST=Antwerp/L=Kapellen/O=Example/CN=Example Root CA/emailAddress=certadm@example.org
```

The ordering seems to be different between both version of python (but consistant within the version itself)

### Setup
Heavily stripped down state due to sensitive info
```
certificate.authority::directory:
  file.directory:
    - name: {{ certcfg['config']['authority_dir'] }}
    - makedirs: true
    - user: root
    - group: nacl
    - dir_mode: 2770

certificate.authority::private-key:
  x509.private_key_managed:
    - name: {{ ca_key_path }}
    - bits: 8192
    - backup: True
    - require:
      - file: certificate.authority::directory

certificate.authority::certificate:
  x509.certificate_managed:
    - name: {{ ca_crt_path }}
    - signing_private_key: {{ ca_key_path }}
    - CN: Example Root CA
    - O: Example
    - C: BE
    - ST: Antwerp
    - L: Kapellen
    - Email: certadm@example.org
    - basicConstraints: "critical CA:true"
    - keyUsage: "critical cRLSign, keyCertSign"
    - subjectKeyIdentifier: hash
    - authorityKeyIdentifier: keyid,issuer:always
    - days_valid: 3650
    - days_remaining: 0
    - backup: True
    - require:
      - x509: certificate.authority::private-key
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- setup a py27 based salt-3000.1 master/minion
- manage a private key + ca cert
- manage a cert signed by the cs
- apply the state
- upgrade to py36 based salt-3000.1 master/minion
- apply the state
- notice both the ca and signed certificate change
