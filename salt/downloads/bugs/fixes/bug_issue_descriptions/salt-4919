After running highstate with git.latest once, subsequent runs fail with:

``` console
----------
    State: - git
    Name:      https://github.com/user/repo.git
    Function:  latest
        Result:    False
        Comment:   fatal: destination path '/home/user/repo' already exists and is not an empty directory.
        Changes:   
```

This error occurs even when using "- force: true".
