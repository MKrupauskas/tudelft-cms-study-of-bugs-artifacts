States depdendent on `__low__` currently fails if called through `__states__` as `__low__` is not defined.

This can be tested through a custom state like this:

``` python
# _states/acc.py

def helper(name, **kwargs):
    return  __states__['file.accumulated'](
        filename='/tmp/accumulated.txt',
        name='lines',
        text=name,
    )
```

and this state definition:

``` yaml
the-file:
    file.managed:
        - name: /tmp/accumulated.txt
        - source: salt://ordering.txt
        - template: jinja

a-line:
    acc.helper:
        - name: a line
        - require_in:
            - file: the-file
```

and for completeness, this template:

``` sls
{% for line in accumulator['lines'] -%}
{{ line }}
{% endfor %}
```

This should have resulted in a file `/tmp/accumulated.txt` with the contents `a line`, but fails with

``` python-traceback
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

  require_in = __low__.get('require_in', [])
