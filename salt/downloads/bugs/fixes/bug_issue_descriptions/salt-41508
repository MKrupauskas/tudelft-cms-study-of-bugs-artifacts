### Description of Issue/Question
When using comments on a 'cron.present' state it does not add a line break at the end of the last line of the comment

### Setup
```
test:
    cron.present:
        - identifier: test-01
        - comment: |
            This is line 1 of my comment
            This is line 2 of my comment
            .
        - name: COMMAND_GOES_HERE >/dev/null 2>&1
        - user: root
        - hour: 1
        - minute: 2
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
After running the state against a minion this is how it looks. The last comment (just a '.') is at the same line and together with SALT_CRON_IDENTIFIER. There should be a line break after it

    # Lines below here are managed by Salt, do not edit
    # This is line 1 of my comment
    # This is line 2 of my comment
    # . SALT_CRON_IDENTIFIER:test-01
    2 1 * * * COMMAND_GOES_HERE >/dev/null 2>&1

Maybe /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/cron.py should be edited so a line break is added after the last comment line
(
if comment:
    ret['comment'] = comment
)
