archive.extracted doesn't accept source: attribute as a list.
The try I made was using :

```
source:
  - http://...
  - salt://...
```

The http:// entry is valid and never taken.

```
source: http://...
```

with the same http entry works.
As described by its documentation, source: should behave the same way as in file.managed.
