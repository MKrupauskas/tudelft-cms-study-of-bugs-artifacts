### Description of Issue/Question

Stopping the `salt-master` with privilege dropping enabled shows a `OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied` for the PIDfile in the logs. So the `salt-master` ist not able to remove the PID file from `/var/run`.

### Setup

SaltStack 2016.11.4 on openSUSE Leap 42.3. Same applies to at least SLES12 SP2.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Configure Salt to run e.g. as user `salt`. 
2. Start `salt-master`
3. Stop `salt-master`

We are now seeing this in the log:

```Python
    os.unlink(self.config['pidfile'])
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/run/salt-m...pid'
```

During start-up `salt-master` is creating the PIDfile with root privileges in `/var/run`. 
Since privileges where dropped to the user `salt`, we are no longer able to remove the PIDfile from `/var/run`, since `/var/run` does not permit this. This happens regardless of the permissions for the PIDfile. 


### Versions Report

Tested with SaltStack 2016.11.4. But I see the same code in develop.
