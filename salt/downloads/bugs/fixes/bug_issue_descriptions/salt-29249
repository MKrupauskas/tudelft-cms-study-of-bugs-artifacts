https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/misc.html#sync-after-install states that this option should work. However, as soon as I boot a new instance, and manually run `saltutil.sync_grains`, it reports that all of my custom grains are synced as new.

I'm using an AMI I created, with `script_args: -C`, since I've preinstalled salt on the image.

Is it possible that because I am not actually installing salt via salt-cloud, it is not processing the after_install step? Seems unlikely.

I'm using salt-cloud `2015-8-1`, installed via git.
