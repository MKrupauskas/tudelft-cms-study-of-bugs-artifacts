Hi,

In systemd, the true name for a service ends with ".service", the form without this suffix being merely a shortcut. SaltStack doesn't understand this:

```
enable-systemd-timesyncd:
  service.enabled:
    - name: systemd-timesyncd.service
```

...results in:

```
          ID: enable-systemd-timesyncd
    Function: service.enabled
        Name: systemd-timesyncd.service
      Result: False
     Comment: The named service systemd-timesyncd.service is not available
     Started: 15:33:45.193092
    Duration: 157.018 ms

If I remove ".service", it works:

```
enable-systemd-timesyncd:
  service.enabled:
    - name: systemd-timesyncd
```

...results in:

```
          ID: enable-systemd-timesyncd
    Function: service.enabled
        Name: systemd-timesyncd
      Result: True
     Comment: Service systemd-timesyncd is already enabled, and is in the desired state
     Started: 15:31:11.620675
    Duration: 171.07 ms

```

The form ending in ".service" being the true form, and the one without the suffix being a shortcut (emphasized by the bash completion for systemctl command), I think SaltStack should understand both and not give an error if ".service" is added to a service name.

Moreover, other suffices work as expected. For example, to have /tmp mounted in a ramdisk:

```
enable-ramtmp:
  service.enabled:
    - name: tmp.mount
```

...results in:

```
          ID: enable-ramtmp
    Function: service.enabled
        Name: tmp.mount
      Result: True
     Comment: Service tmp.mount is already enabled, and is in the desired state
     Started: 15:31:11.799996

Thanks.
