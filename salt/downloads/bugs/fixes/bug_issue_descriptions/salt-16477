If I launch this command: `salt '*' acl.getfacl /home`

It :boom: with this error:

```
minion2.test.local:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 797, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/linux_acl.py", line 78, in getfacl
        user=ret[dentry]['comments']['owner'],
    KeyError: ''`
```

Minions matched by this command are all RHEL5 (both i386 and x86_64).
I tested the same command pointing to a RHEL6 minion and it works as expected.

Some info about my minions (salt-call --versions-report)

```
               Salt: 2014.1.10
             Python: 2.6.8 (unknown, Nov  7 2012, 14:47:34)
             Jinja2: 2.5.5
           M2Crypto: 0.21.1
     msgpack-python: 0.1.12
       msgpack-pure: Not Installed
           pycrypto: 2.3
             PyYAML: 3.08
              PyZMQ: 14.3.1
                ZMQ: 3.2.2
```

P.s.: by the way, it seems that all other function (acl.version, acl.wipefacls and acl.modfacl) work as expected on RHEL5 minions
