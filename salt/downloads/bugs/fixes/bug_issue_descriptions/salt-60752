**Description**
the command `salt <target> pkg.list_upgrades --out=json` will list all available updates for a given system.  I noticed on redhat 7 systems, that it erroneously includes "Loaded: plugins:" as a pending package, so my guess it's some sort of parsing issue.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
`salt <redhat 7 system> pkg.list_upgrades --out=json | jq 'to_entries[]'`

produces a response like this:
{
  "key": "mycomputer",
  "value": {
    "salt": "3003.2-1.el7",
    "salt-minion": "3003.2-1.el7",
    "Loaded": "plugins:" <---- need to filter this out
}

**Expected behavior**
expected behavior is to not include 

**Versions Report**
3003.1 for master and minions
