### Description of Issue/Question

Salt logs returner errors like this:

```python
            try:
                self.minion.returners[event_return](self.event_queue)
            except Exception as exc:
                log.error('Could not store events - returner \'{0}\' raised '
                          'exception: {1}'.format(event_return, exc))
```

In master logs these appear like this:

```
Dec 01 00:00:55 myhost docker[12610]: [ERROR   ] Could not store events - returner 'foo' raised exception: 'arg'
Dec 01 00:00:55 myhost docker[12610]: [ERROR   ] Could not store events - returner 'foo' raised exception: 'arg'
Dec 01 00:00:58 myhost docker[12610]: [ERROR   ] Could not store events - returner 'foo' raised exception: 'arg'
```

The error is not very useful for debugging without a stack trace.
