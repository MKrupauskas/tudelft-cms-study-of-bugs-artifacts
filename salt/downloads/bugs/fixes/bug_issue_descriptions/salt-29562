We have the following issue with 2015.8.1 and 2015.8.3 when using file.recurse with keep_symlinks set to True:

A softlink which name is a subset (Like: ^NAME_SOFTLINK\* ) of other filenames in the same directory will let salt ignore these files by the next update. If "clean: True" is set too, these files would be also deleted from the slave. We discovered this while syncing some custom compiled linux libraries with the typical  libxyz.so.X.0.0 -> libxyz.so.X  -> libxyz.so linking.

 A simple example:

```
   mkdir test; cd test
   touch test1 test2 test3
   ln -s test3 test

  cat << EOF > test.sls
   /tmp/test/:
   file.recurse:
     - source: salt://test/
     - include_empty: True
     - clean: True
     - keep_symlinks: True
  EOF
```

The output:

```
----------
          ID: /tmp/test/
    Function: file.recurse
      Result: True
     Comment: Recursively updated /tmp/test/
     Started: 12:00:59.395207
    Duration: 321.6 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              /tmp/test/test:
                  ----------
                  new:
                      /tmp/test/test
```

As you see only the symlink survives. All other matching files are ignored.
