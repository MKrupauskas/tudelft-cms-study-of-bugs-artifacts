### Description of Issue/Question

When I run "salt-cloud -m <map file>" with the nova driver, if a VM from that map already exists, I get the following error:

```
[INFO    ] Applying map from 'blah'.
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad nova.optimize_providers: 'nova.optimize_providers' is not available.
[DEBUG   ] The 'nova' cloud driver is unable to be optimized.
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded versions.warn_until

[ERROR   ] There was a query error: u'state'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 303, in run
    dmap = mapper.map_data()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2005, in map_data

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 1994, in get_matching_by_name
    matches[driver] = details['state']
KeyError: u'state'
```

### Setup

I have an Openstack cloud provider using the driver "nova". (I wasn't able to get the openstack driver to work correctly in my environment, hence why I stuck with nova for now.)

I've worked around the issue by changing "status" to "state" in `salt/utils/openstack/nova.py:server_list_min()`, but I don't know if that breaks anything else.

Might be of interest: both `server_list()` and `server_list_detailed()` define the attribute "state", but `server_list_min()` defines "status".

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Using the nova cloud provider, spawn a map using "salt-cloud -m <map file>". Once the VMs are created, run "salt-cloud -m <map file>" again.
