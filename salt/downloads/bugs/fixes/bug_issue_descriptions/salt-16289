file.absent is not working if the directory have too much files (11233 files) and directories (2392 directories) in it.

```
win:
          ID: delete_directory
    Function: file.absent
        Name: C:/test
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to remove directory C:/test
     Changes:   
```

If I use the following cmd.run function, the deletion process is working fine:

rmdir "C:/test" /s /q
