Yesterday I had an interesting experience w/ the salt-master 2014.1.3-2precise1 ... /var/cache/salt/master/jobs ate all the inodes on the /var file-system (file-count under /var/cache/salt/master/jobs was ~ 406K).
The master didn't do any work any more, and didn't log anything.
I stopped it, restarted it, and debug output stopped after "Loading config file".  It wouldn't open any network sockets, minions couldn't talk to it.
Of course I did a 'df -h' to see whether the disk was full or something, but it said non filesystem was using more than 40% space.
I only realised what was happening when I tried to reinstall salt, and apt told me "the disk was full" (which wasn't technically correct since there was 68% space capacity left).
But I quickly found the actual issue after that, and have since moved /var/cache/salt to it's own file-system
An error message from the master to suggest the reason of its inactivity would have helped me find the issue more quickly.  Can this be added, please?
