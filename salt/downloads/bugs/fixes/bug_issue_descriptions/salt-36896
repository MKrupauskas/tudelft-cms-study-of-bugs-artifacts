### Description of Issue/Question

I've been struggling for tens of hours now trying to create a super simple state that just installs mysql-server, python-mysqldb, mysql-client and creates a DB. I'm completely new to salt, so I might be doing something very wrong, but after chatting with multiple others at #salt on IRC nobody seems to know what the problem is. Others can reproduce the problem too.

I've been told by multiple people that I need reload_modules to make it work, but it doesn't help, it still looks as if python-mysqldb is undetected/not available at runtime(?).

What am I doing wrong? It seems like such a simple task, but I'm stuck and nobody knows.
### Setup

Using 2016.3.3 on Ubuntu 16.04, clean minimal install.

SLS file:

```
database-packages:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - python-mysqldb
      - mysql-server
      - mysql-client
    - reload_modules: true

mysql-is-running:
  service.running:
    - name: mysql
    - enable: True

has-db:
  mysql_database.present:
    - name: example
    - order: last
```

Error:

```
ID: has-db
    Function: mysql_database.present
        Name: example
      Result: False

If I run state.apply again then everything is working, it just won't work if python-mysqldb gets installed on the same run. I can install python-mysqldb first manually, then it works. I have also tried to install mysql-\* first, but it makes no difference.

The error above is the same even if the python-mysqldb package is missing, so that makes me think that it's not available at runtime.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Set up a clean 16.04 install, install salt-minion using the saltstack repos(or from the Ubuntu repos, doesn't make any difference) and assign the state to the minion.

First state.apply = The error from above.(fails to create DB, but the packages gets installed)
Second state.apply = The database is created.(works)
Third state.apply = No changes.(works)
