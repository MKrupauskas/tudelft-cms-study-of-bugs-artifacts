When running a `git.latest` state with a dedicated identity file specified, it doesn't use the identity file at some point and ask for the password instead:

```

```

This happens here when running the state from the minion using `salt-call state.highstate` and doesn't happen when running the highstate from the master directly.

I have this problem since I upgraded to 0.17.1, it didn't show up on the 0.16.4 I was using before.

It seems it happens only when running `git ls-remote` which, from https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/git.py#L36, seems to be the only Git function which is called outside of the Salt's Git module, which correctly uses the identity file passed to the state.
