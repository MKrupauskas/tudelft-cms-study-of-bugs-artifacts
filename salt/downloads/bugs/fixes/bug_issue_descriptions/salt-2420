there seems to be a permission problem while installing passenger gem via:

<pre>
passenger:
  gem.installed:
    - runas: rails
    - require:
      - rvm: ree-1.8.7-2011.03
</pre>

<pre>

executing the install line manually as user rails in a shell successfully installs passenger.
i guess it's a wrongly set $GEM_HOME
user rails is in group rvm.
