In 2014.1.4 version I can specify the target machine execute commands, the target machine not written in the roster file
command like this

```
salt-ssh 'ip' test.ping --passwd rootpassword
ip:
    True 
```

But in 2015.5.3 version failed

result:

```
No hosts found with target ip of type glob 
```

So.....In 2015.5.3 version,the target machine must be written in a roster file?
