### Description of Issue/Question

tuned module broken on centOS 7.3

the tuned.list module is broken now that `tuned-adm` returns a description inline with the tune profile.

````
salt-call cmd.run "tuned-adm list"
local:
    Available profiles:
    - balanced                    - General non-specialized tuned profile
    - desktop                     - Optmize for the desktop use-case
    - latency-performance         - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
    - network-latency             - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
    - network-throughput          - Optimize for streaming network throughput.  Generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks.
    - powersave                   - Optimize for low power consumption
    - throughput-performance      - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads.  This is the default profile for RHEL7.
    - virtual-guest               - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest.
    - virtual-host                - Optimize for running KVM guests
    Current active profile: balanced
