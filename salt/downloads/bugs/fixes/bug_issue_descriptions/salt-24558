I'm relatively new to salt; but I believe I have everything setup correctly.

I ran `salt '*' saltutil.sync_all` to add a custom module to my minions

This is the output I receive when trying to test my module: 

```
dev2.patcave.info:
    "ufw.status" is not available.
haproxy1.patcave.info:
    Status: inactive
mc1.patcave.info:
    Status: inactive

    Status: inactive
saltmaster.patcave.info:
    Status: active

    To                         Action      From

    22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
    4505/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
    4506/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
    22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    4505/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
    4506/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

I investigated further on my `dev2` minion; and indeed found the correct version of my module in `/var/cache/salt/minion/`. There is absolutely no difference between my `dev2` and `dev3` boxes; they are identically configured, however it seemed to work fine on `dev3`

I deleted the copy it had on `dev2` and restarted the minion; then ran another sync, and it seemed to fix the issue. I could imagine this being a big issue if many minions fail to sync modules across a large cluster.

Not sure if it is a bug or some kind of caching issue? 

Thanks!
