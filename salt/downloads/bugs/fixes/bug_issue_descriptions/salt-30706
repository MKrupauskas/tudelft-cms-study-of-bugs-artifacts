[10:04] <carson-anderson> Sorry about that ugly paste. o~O  Pastebin for my weird traceback here: http://pastebin.com/xyZ4CSvT
[10:05] <carson-anderson> I was hoping that someone here could help me out. I've been debugging it for a while to no avail
[10:05] <iggy> carson-anderson: disable your mongo logging and try again?
[10:05] <carson-anderson> That's the odd part. I have not even enabled mongo logging.
[10:05] <iggy> salt thinks you did
[10:06] <iggy> carson-anderson: do you have any logging enabled?
[10:06] <iggy> (aside from the default)
[10:06] <carson-anderson> Nope
[10:07] <AndreasLutro> carson-anderson: looks like you need to add log4mongo_handler to your minion config
[10:08] <carson-anderson> Won't that make it log to mongo? This is a very new salt setup and I don't need any logging yet.
[10:09] <carson-anderson> this server is running mongo. But it has nothing to do with salt.
[10:09] <AndreasLutro> hmm, maybe salt automatically tried loading that handler if mongodb is installed
[10:09] <iggy> are there any log4mongo modules installed on the system?
[10:10] <iggy> (i.e. for other software on the box)
[10:10] <AndreasLutro> though that seems kinda odd
[10:11] <carson-anderson> iggy: yes. There is the salt log4mongo_mod.py and a standard log4mongo install under /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/log4mongo
[10:11] <AndreasLutro> I think you can ignore the error, and create an issue on github about it
[10:12] <iggy> carson-anderson: can you test on a system without log4mongo?
[10:12] <AndreasLutro> actually it might be fixed already
[10:12] <iggy> if that works, then yeah, salt is erroneously finding the module and assuming you want to use it
[10:14] <carson-anderson> iggy: Yes. I've installed salt-minion on over 200 other servers and this is the first time I've hit this particular bug.
[10:14] <iggy> carson-anderson: do the others have log4mongo installed?
[10:15] <carson-anderson> Not that I'm aware of. Let me check
[10:15] <iggy> so yeah, might be what I said
[10:15] <AndreasLutro> https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/log/handlers/log4mongo_mod.py#L71-L73
[10:15] <AndreasLutro> someone here thought yielding early is the same as returning early :p
[10:16] <carson-anderson> That would explain it :)
[10:17] <carson-anderson> Should I submit a PR or just post an Issue for this?
[10:17] <carson-anderson> I'm comfortable with either
[10:17] <iggy> it should likely just return False in the __virtual__ function if there is no config
[10:17] <iggy> open an issue
[10:18] <AndreasLutro> __opts__ might not be populated when __virtual__ is called I think
[10:18] <carson-anderson> Changing the yield to a return stopped the traceback for me
[10:19] <AndreasLutro> you normally can't just change a yield to a return though
[10:19] <AndreasLutro> it makes the function behave entirely different
[10:19] <AndreasLutro> though there  could be code in place to handle that case already
[10:19] <iggy> in any case, file an issue and see what the devs think
```
