I found a problem with the Windows minion. On one of my computers it hard locks the computer after some time. The computer is not reacting to any input/network ping any more after the incident. The num-lock key is not showing any reaction on the keyboards LED.

While i can reproduce the problem only on one (relatively high-end) system, i think i had a similar problem on the other machines until i accepted the key on the server.

To me it sound not like a salt issue, because it would be very sad if a userspace  tool could crash windows like this.

System details:
Dell Precision T5400 
Dual XEON with 16GB RAM
Windows 7 64bit
Salt 0.15.3 AMD64
