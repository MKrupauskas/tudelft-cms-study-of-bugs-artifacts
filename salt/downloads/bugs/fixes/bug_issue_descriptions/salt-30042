Python 2.7.10's `platform.uname()` returns the following:

``` python
('Windows', 'WIN-DNNG82401FO', '2012Server', '6.2.9200', 'AMD64', 'Intel64 Family 6 Model 63 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel')
```

Salt derives its value for the `osrelease` grain from the third field of that tuple [[1](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/c557008e24c027733cc1f23bdfdbba8358cc369d/salt/grains/core.py#L1084)][[2](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/c557008e24c027733cc1f23bdfdbba8358cc369d/salt/grains/core.py#L1096)], and since [the current release](https://repo.saltstack.com/windows/Salt-Minion-2015.8.3-AMD64-Setup.exe) is built against this version of Python, Salt sets the grain to the wrong value.  (Note that I've only tested the 64-bit version of Salt.)  This breaks modules, states, formulas, etc. that depend on the `osrelease` grain.

Python 2.7.11's `platform.uname()` returns the correct value:

``` python
('Windows', 'WIN-DNNG82401FO', '2012ServerR2', '6.3.9600', 'AMD64', 'Intel64 Family 6 Model 63 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel')
```

I don't have a workaround for this bug yet.  To fix it SaltStack would need to re-package the Salt minion for Windows with the newer Python runtime.
