### Description of Issue

The AWS API requires that TXT records be surrounded in quotation marks in order to persist them with route53.

I absolutely couldn't figure out how to do this with the jinja templating engine, whatever I tried it just simply wouldn't pass the quotes correctly to the state.

In order to fix this we inject the quotes in the state if the type happens to be a TXT record.

### Setup

Something like this:
```
route53 present 38d9bf7f-edfc-4c0b-b629-9e97c2d69932:
    boto3_route53.rr_present:
        - name: DOMAIN.
        - DomainName: DOMAIN.
        - TTL: 60
        - Type: TXT
        - ResourceRecords:  
            - "google-site-verification=JUNK" 
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
[INFO    ] Executing state boto3_route53.rr_present for [DOMAIN]
[DEBUG   ] Name after massaging is: DOMAIN
[DEBUG   ] ResourceRecords: [{'Value': 'google-site-verification=JUNK'}]
[DEBUG   ] The resulting ChangeBatch is: {'Changes': [{'Action': 'UPSERT', 'ResourceRecordSet': {'TTL': 60, 'Type': 'TXT', 'Name': 'DOMAIN, 'ResourceRecords': [{'Value': 'google-site-verification=JUNK'}]}}]}
[ERROR   ] Failed to apply requested changes to the hosted zone /hostedzone/ZRIWYPSFASS8O: An error occurred (InvalidChangeBatch) when calling the ChangeResourceRecordSets operation: Invalid Resource Record: FATAL problem: InvalidCharacterString (Value should be enclosed in quotation marks) encountered with 'google-site-verification=JUNK'
```
