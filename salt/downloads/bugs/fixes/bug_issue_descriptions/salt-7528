Per chat with UtahDave in the IRC channel, I've been trying to get salt-ssh
working, and am hitting lots of issues.  Recording some of them here.

1) password-only is not presently possible
- salt.client.ssh.SSH _always_ sets a private key there is no attribute that a user can set to preclude this
- Various tests later will attempt passwd, but then fall back to public key auth

2) sshpass is required for password auth
- When sshpass is not available, no useful information is provided at run
  time.  Operations fail in unexpected ways(public key fallthrough)
  - sshpass is not part of standard RHEL distribution (CentOS, Scientific linux)
  - sshpass is available from EPEL for 5 and 6.
  - sshpass is not available for 4 from a standard repo

Can we fall back to expect?  Throw an error?

3) ControlPersist not available until Openssh 5.5

    command-line: line 0: Bad configuration option: ControlPersist
```
- RHEL 4   - 3.9p1
- RHEL 5/6 - 5.3p1

Fall back to omit it?
