### Description of Issue/Question

This seems to have resulted in 'if_missing' to be creates as a directory if something is provided.

``` yaml
account.profile.base::{{ login }}:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /home/{{ login }}
    - if_missing: /home/{{ login }}/.salt-profile-base
    - archive_format: tar
    - source:
        - salt://common/account/_files/profile-base.tar.gz.{{ salt.grains.get('os')|lower }}
        - salt://common/account/_files/profile-fallback.tar.gz
    - user: {{ login }}
    - group: {{ group }}
    - require:
        - user: account.user::{{ login }}
  file.managed:
    - name: /home/{{ login }}/.salt-profile-base
    - user: {{ login }}
    - group: {{ group }}
    - contents: '## salt marker file ##'
    - watch:
        - archive: account.profile.base::{{ login }}
```

The above snippet extracts the archive and used to create .salt-profile-base as a marker file.
So get a update profile the user just has to remove the marker and it will be updated next profile run.

However after this commit it seems to archive.extracted seems to create the location specified in if_missing as a directory.

Even when removing the file.managed one, a directory with the path of if_missing shows up. (I checked that it was not in the archive. This is also easily verified by changing the if_missing to something else to test.

This new odd behavior seems to come form this commit as my minions running a pure 2016.3rc2 do not suffer from this. Only the ones I updated today tracking the 2016.3 branch.

Also assuming that if_missing is always a directory is probably not desired.
### Setup

See above for an example snippet.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Put a random path in if_missing and it will end up as a directory.
