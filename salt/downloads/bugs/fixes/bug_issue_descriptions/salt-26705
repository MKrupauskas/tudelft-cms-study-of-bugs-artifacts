After update of Salt-Master to Salt : 2015.5.5-1 from EPEL-Testing on Scientific Linux 6, can't catch what exactly had happened, but  the very same pillars loading failing :  

Machine running : 
`Scientific Linux release 6.5 (Carbon)`

Example of simple failing pillar 

``` yaml
graphite_server: tkgraphite-01.tkl.local
graphite_web: graphite.tkl.local
graphite:
  config:
    port: 2003
    pickle_port: 2004
```

Refresh pillar  fails with error :

All runs ok. I already running the **2015.5.3**, but maybe, from Monday - I can try to upgrade, and play again with pillars to help somehow.
And yes, running in debug mode, not actually makes the situation clear. The same error. Strange that when running with log-level **debug** I can see Salt-Master loading HUGE complex pillar, and failing on a pillar consisting of just 4 lines.
