So I want Salt to clear out the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` folder of any sources.list files it doesn't manage.

First attempt:

``` saltstack
core-apt-sources-dir-clean:
  file.directory:
    - name: /etc/apt/sources.list.d
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 755
    - clean: True
    - require:
      - pkgrepo: core-apt-ubuntu

core-apt-ubuntu:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.list
    - name: deb [arch=amd64] https://{{ repouser }}:{{ repopass }}@repo.company.com/ubuntu/ {{ grains['lsb_distrib_codename'] }} production
    - key_url: salt://core/apt/files/aptly.pub
```

Nope:

```

              removed:
                  - /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.list
```

Ok, maybe it can only exclude something if it's a file:

``` saltstack
core-apt-sources-dir-clean:
  file.directory:
    - name: /etc/apt/sources.list.d
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 755
    - clean: True
    - require:
      - file: core-apt-ubuntu

core-apt-ubuntu:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.list
    - source: salt://core/apt/files/ubuntu.list.jinja
    - template: jinja
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644
    - makedirs: True
```

```

                  0644

          ID: core-apt-sources-dir-clean
    Function: file.directory

              removed:
                     - /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.list
```

Nope.

The docs are a little sparse:

```
clean
    Make sure that only files that are set up by salt and required by this function are kept. If this option is set then everything in this directory will be deleted unless it is required.
require
    Require other resources such as packages or files
exclude_pat
    When 'clean' is set to True, exclude this pattern from removal list and preserve in the destination.
```

Which to me reads that if something is required the end file it produces (if in that directory) won't get removed, which doesn't appear to be the case.

I also gave `exclude_pat` a go with no joy:

``` saltstack
core-apt-sources-dir-clean:
  file.directory:
    - name: /etc/apt/sources.list.d
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 755
    - clean: True
    - exclude_pat: '(myrepo|ubuntu).list'
```

Also tried `(myrepo|ubuntu)` & `(myrepo|ubuntu)\.list` with no joy.

Tested on salt versions v2015.5.0 to v2015-5-5 and 2015.8 (all from git using the bootstrap), running on Ubuntu 14.04.
