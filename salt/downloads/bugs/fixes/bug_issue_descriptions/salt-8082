The 'tok' field in progress events is getting returned to the client.apy get event.
Since it may have not utf-8 encoding it can break Halite.

See https://github.com/saltstack/halite/issues/54 for details.
Temporary workaround is to catch the exeption in halite, but better to remove at source.
Problem it don't know where to remove.  If wait until it gets to client/api.py then have to filter all events for progress events so not efficient.
