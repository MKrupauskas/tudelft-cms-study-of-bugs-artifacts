2015.2 adds Event Returners ( http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/returners/#event-returners )

Two new configuration options have been added to the Master config.

event_return: <list of one or more returners>
event_return_queue: <the number of events to queue before flushing to the event_return function in each returner specified in the Master config event_return parameter>

The default for event_return_queue value is 0 ( https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.2/salt/config.py )

The Event Return interface implements a multiprocess FIFO queue that flushes to the event_return function in each returner when len(event_queue) >= event_return_queue

Events are lost if the event_queue contains events (hasn't filled the queue) and salt-master is shutdown.

For example, if event_return_queue is set to 10, and salt-master is shutdown while there are 9 events in the event_queue, the 9 events in the queue are lost.

Perhaps the graceful way to ensure all events have a chance to complete their journey (i.e. persist a DB), the salt-master should at least try to flush the queue(s) when salt-master is signaled to shutdown.
