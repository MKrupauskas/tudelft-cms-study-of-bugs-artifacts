when i update a package using pip for example when updating psutil package, Saltstack doesn't know that there is a package has been updated. so the right thing is to execute saltutil.sync_grains but it doesn't work correctly in my case the only solution for me is to restart the minion. is there any work around instead of restarting the minion ? so i will be able to add that work around inside my state ?

i have tried both sync_all , sync_grains , reload_grains but none of these works as expected and i have to restart the minion.
