I am unable to get the most recent copy of my hgfs pulled from bitbucket. I believe the cause for this issue is also what is causing my inability to pull from github. The following is my /etc/salt/master configuration file

```
fileserver_backend:
  - hg

hgfs_remotes:
  - https://jasonzhu12@bitbucket.org/jasonzhu12/salt

hgfs_root: salt

hgfs_branch_method: branches
```

and here is my salt --versions-report

```
           Salt: 0.17.4
         Python: 2.7.5 (default, Nov 12 2013, 16:45:54)
         Jinja2: 2.7.1
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.1.13
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 13.0.2
            ZMQ: 3.2.4
```

Here is a listing of my /var/cache/salt/master/hgfs directory:

```
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x.  3 root root 4.0K Feb  1 21:35 8cf641c5014942d0da15c9a8810cb7a5
drwxr-xr-x. 10 root root 4.0K Feb  1 21:31 ..
drwxr-xr-x.  3 root root 4.0K Feb  1 21:31 .
```

While trying to debug this issue I added the following traceback lines to the update function in hgfs.py file. 

```
    try:
        salt.fileserver.reap_fileserver_cache_dir(os.path.join(__opts__['cachedir'], 'hgfs/hash'), find_file)
    except (IOError, OSError):
            try:
        salt.fileserver.reap_fileserver_cache_dir(os.path.join(__opts__['cachedir'], 'hgfs/hash'), find_file)
    except (IOError, OSError):
        import traceback # Line I added
        traceback.print_exc() # Line I added 
        # Hash file won't exist if no files have yet been served up
        pass
```

The exception that I am getting is the following:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/fileserver/hgfs.py", line 201, in update
    find_file
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/fileserver/__init__.py", line 57, in reap_fileserver_cache_dir
    for env in os.listdir(cache_base):
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/cache/salt/master/hgfs/hash'
```

It appears that the hash directory is missing and the code cannot iterate through it. I am not sure what the purpose of that piece of code is nor am I sure what is supposed to create it. 

Note that when I run the following commands:

```
cd /var/cache/salt/master/hgfs/8cf641c5014942d0da15c9a8810cb7a5/
hg update 
```

It populates it with my bitbucket directory but I am still unable to do a salt * state.highstate. The error I am getting is 

```
