### Description of Issue/Question

`git.latest` with `force_reset` set to `True` does not reset local changes, causing it to fail.
### Setup

Two states, one to clone a git repo, another that templates a config file after cloning. It will work the first time, but the second time it will fail. 

``` yaml
webapp:
  git.latest:
    - name: [redacted]
    - rev: {{ git_rev }}
    - target: /var/www/
    - force_reset: True

settings:
  file.managed:
    - name: /var/www/appname/settings.py
    - source: salt://app/settings.py
    - template: jinja
    - watch:
      - git: webapp
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

My relevant real logs can be found here: https://gist.github.com/akoumjian/d464a69fa3b3cce8f0d5ad27a8e6f42c

You will notice the absence of reset ever being issued. I suspect this is the problem.
