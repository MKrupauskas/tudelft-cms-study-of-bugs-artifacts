The pertinent part of my master config:

```
peer:
  boucha:
    - test.*
      - network.*
  .*:
    - network.*
```

I'm running commands such as the following:

```
salt-call publish.publish 'cass*' network.ip_addrs eth0
```

and

```
 salt-call publish.publish 'roles:seed' network.ip_addrs eth0 grain
```

Sometimes I get one item in the response, when there should be three. More often than not I get an empty response. It feels like salt-call is returning before the results are available.
