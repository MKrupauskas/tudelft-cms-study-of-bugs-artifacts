### Description of Issue/Question

I was testing the new `salt.cmd` runner: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/releases/2016.11.0.html#additional-features
(which I find very handy in some particular cases).

When the command does not return a python dict, it raises a TypeError exception.

Let's just consider a simple to reproduce case:

```
$ sudo salt-run salt.cmd hipchat.send_message 1234 'Yo @mircea' ''
Exception occurred in runner salt.cmd: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/state/home/mircea/salt/salt/client/mixins.py", line 399, in _low
    if 'data' in data['return']:
TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterable
```

The `hipchat.send_message` command returns True or False depending if able to post in the hipchat room.
