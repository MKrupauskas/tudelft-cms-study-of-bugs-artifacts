Is there a list of states that support `check_cmd`? I was attempting to use it with `cmd.run` but the option appeared to be ignored. I checked the source for 2014.7 and develop, and `check_cmd` isn't present. The example in the documentation uses `file.managed`, so I looked at that as well and the check_cmd code was easy enough to spot.
