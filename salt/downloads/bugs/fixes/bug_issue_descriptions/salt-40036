### Description of Issue/Question
I'm trying to define a new network alias (on the loopback interface), and I'm receiving a variable scoping exception.

### Setup
My state is as follows:
```
dev-loopback-ip:
  network.managed:
    - name: lo:1
    - onboot: yes
    - type: alias
    - bootproto: none
    - nickname: loopback
    - ipaddr: 127.0.0.2
    - netmask: 255.255.255.255
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
When I attempt to apply highstate from master to minion, I get the following:
```
          ID: dev-loopback-ip
    Function: network.managed
        Name: lo:1
      Result: False
