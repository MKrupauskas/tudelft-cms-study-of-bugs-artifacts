`salt.utils.cloud` function `is_public_ip` is not aware of 127/8 and so when passed an address for determination on whether it is public, will return a default True when given `127.0.0.1`

`is_public_ip` is used by the salt-ssh roster `cache` in `extract_ipv4` to determine if the address is public, resulting in `127.0.0.1` being considered a public address and used for subsequent ssh connections, which are then directed at the local host.

I'm not sure if `is_public_ip` should be 127/8 aware or whether the salt-ssh cache roster should be doing additional checks, but either way it is a problem that prevents salt-ssh from working.

NB. This problem only becomes active when the ipv4 grain returns the loopback address as first in the list.
