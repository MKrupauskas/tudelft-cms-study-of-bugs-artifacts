Currently on Ubuntu 14.04, using the Salt PPA, there are two startup files for salt-minion and salt-master - one in /etc/init.d (init) and one in /etc/init (upstart).

I don't know if its a new change or not - I just noticed this at the moment when having high CPU usage.

I suggest removing the one in /etc/init.d and using upstart
