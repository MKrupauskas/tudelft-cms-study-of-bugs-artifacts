### Description of Issue/Question

The new preflight command uses `__opts__` rather than the 'opts' argument passed to the bootstrap method.  This can cause errors if bootstrap is called with a different configuration.

[Yes, I know that no one but me ever wants to do that.  My use case is weird.]

I have the single-line fix prepared and will submit a PR in a matter of moments after submitting this issue.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

call bootstrap from a system where `__opts__` does not have a 'profiles' key defined.

```
  File "/ --- my source tree  ---  modules/vagrant.py", line 335, in _start
    ret = __utils__['cloud.bootstrap'](vm_, fudged_opts)
  File "/projects/SaltStack/salt/utils/cloud.py", line 460, in bootstrap
    'preflight_cmds', vm_, __opts__, default=[]
  File "/projects/SaltStack/salt/config/__init__.py", line 3106, in get_cloud_config_value
    if name in opts['profiles'][vm_['profile']]:
KeyError: 'profiles'
```
