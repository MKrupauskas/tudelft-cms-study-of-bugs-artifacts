I seem to have come across a weird bug in 17.4. I can't tell yet if it's impacting anything but whenever I have a state execute on a minion I'm greeted with the following error message (no matter the state):

```
/etc/init.d/salt-minion: line 67: [: 25051: unary operator expected
```

line 67 of the my salt-minion init script is the following:

```
if [ $(pidofproc $PROCESS) ]; then
```
