### Description of Issue/Question

After upgrading to 2018.3.2 (from 2017.7.2), I've found that when using pillar data (with non-ascii characters) while rendering yaml sls files, it fails with: UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte...

AFAIK it is due to PyYAML, as invoked at salt/utils/yamldumper.py:safe_dump, returning an 'str' object, which later on is being coerced into unicode as if it where an ascii-based string.

IMHO, this can be fixed by invoking salt.utils.stringutils.to_unicode() to yaml data before returning. I'll try to submit a pull-req next.

### Setup

First you will need some misc data at pillar (in my case git-based ext_pillar), like:

/tmp/k2.sls

```
data:
  question: Quieres Caf√©?
```

Then a sample state like this one:

```
{%- set data = salt['pillar.get']('data') %}

/tmp/k.settings:
  file.managed:
    - encoding: UTF-8
    - contents: |
      {{ data|yaml }}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
# salt-call  -l debug state.template /tmp/k2.sls
[...]
