### Description of Issue/Question

We have at least three salt minion 2016.3.0 that have somehow default log level INFO. Although minion config file states, that if 'log_level' is commented out, default should be WARNING.
If 'log_level' is explicitly set to warning in minion conf, everything works as expected.

Basically the upgraded/new minions are suddenly more talkative than expected.
Please set the default back to warning. That was enough :)

Thank you.
