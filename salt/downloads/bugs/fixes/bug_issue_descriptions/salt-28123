Hi,
local.cmd(pattern, ['grains.items','pkg.list_pkgs'], [[],[]])
is now returning an empty dictionary for windows minions.

It still works with just one command. For instance
local.cmd(pattern, 'grains.items',[]) still works.
Maybe it's just something I'm doing wrong but in any event
I need (want) help to understand what it is in that case.
