**Description**
Virtual block devices, like loopbacks, ram disks and device-mappers were show as real devices.

The loopback and device-mapper devices are in the "disks" grain:

```
# salt-call grains.get disks
local:
    - loop1
    - dm-1
    - loop6
    - dm-6
    - loop4
    - dm-4
    - loop2
    - dm-2
    - loop0
    - dm-0
    - loop7
    - dm-7
    - sda
    - loop5
    - dm-5
    - loop3
    - dm-3
```

And the RAM disks in the "SSDs" grain:

```
# salt-call grains.get SSDs
local:
    - ram2
    - ram0
    - ram9
    - ram14
    - ram7
    - ram12
    - ram5
    - ram10
    - ram3
    - ram1
    - ram15
    - ram8
    - ram13
    - ram6
    - ram11
    - ram4
```

**Setup**
Linux machine with only one physical disk, no SSDs:

```
# lsblk -d
NAME MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda    8:0    0 298.1G  0 disk
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Any Linux machine with LVM volumes or loopback devices.

**Expected behavior**
The disk grains would return only the existing disk, the sda.
