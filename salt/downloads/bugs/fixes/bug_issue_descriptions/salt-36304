### Description of Issue/Question

When starting the minion with a transport that is not currently supported I see this stack trace:

```
[root@localhost ~]# salt-minion -ldebug
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Including configuration from '/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf'
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf

  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/daemons/flo/core.py", line 23, in <module>
    from raet import raeting
ImportError: No module named raet
```

And my minion config looks like this:

```
[root@localhost ~]# grep -E -v '^$|#' /etc/salt/minion
master: localhost
transport: doesnotexist
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. add a transport ot your config that does not exist
2. attempt to start the minion and you will see the stack trace.

You will see this stack trace error posted above. I would expect to see an error message similar to:

```
the transport doesnotexist is currently not supported. Please use one of the following: tcp, zermoq
```
