``` sls
routes:
  network.routes:
    - name: eth0
    - routes:
      - name: secure_network
        ipaddr: 10.2.0.0
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        gateway: 10.1.0.3
```

On Centos 7,  this will produce the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/routes-eth0 like:

```
# secure_network
10.2.0.0/255.255.255.0 via 10.1.0.3
```

which is wrong, will add route to 10.2.0.0/25 instead 10.2.0.0/24

It works with `netmask: 24`.

Regards.
