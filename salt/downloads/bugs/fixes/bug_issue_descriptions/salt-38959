### Description of Issue/Question

The `archive.extracted` salt state does not work with `.tar.xz` files under CentOS 6 

### Setup

```
{% if not salt['file.directory_exists']('/opt/android/sdk_v3') %}
android_v3_present:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /opt/android/
    - if_missing: /opt/android/sdk_v3
    - source: http://internal-repo/android_v3.tar.xz
    # - source_hash: sha256=omitted
    - archive_format: tar
    - tar_options: J
    - options: J
    - require:
      - file: /opt/android
{% endif %}
```
Unrelated to this bug report, but note that `file.directory_exists` is used to guard the installation, rather than just `if_missing`. It was found that `if_missing` would still download the archive, and the archive in question is about 2GB large so that should be avoided if possible.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Use CentOS 6 or any other OS providing an `xz` implementation without `-l`.
2. Call the relevant sls for `archive.extracted` (or even do a `state.single`)

It will call an internal function `_list_tar` in `salt/modules/archive.py`. This has some logic relying on `xz -l`, which always fails on CentOS 6.

Other notes:

* Invoking the system tar, `tar tJf file.tar.xz` or just `tar tf file.tar.xz`, would have worked and provided enough information to complete the state
* This can probably be worked around with `list_options`, but that should not be necessary in the common case.
* Since there's already an `if_missing`, surely it's fine to skip the listing step? Maybe if `enforce_toplevel` is also false it could be skipped. Or perhaps the listing could be somehow made lazy, executing only when required and essentially getting that for free.
