I am testing salt master and minion on the same machine.
Every time I run : 

```
   >eonSpider ~ # service salt-master restart; service salt-minion restart;
   salt-master stop/waiting
   salt-master start/running, process 21317
   salt-minion stop/waiting
   salt-minion start/running, process 21327
```

the next command after restarting will not print anything, I should call the command 2 or 3 times to show a result : 

```
Example
   > eonSpider ~ # salt eonSpider state.highstate
```

Will show nothing.

The second time (sometimes the third) the command works.

Another important thing : 
Sometimes the number of :

```
 ps -ef|grep salt|grep -v 'grep'|wc -l
```

will increase everytime I make a restart to master and minion.
