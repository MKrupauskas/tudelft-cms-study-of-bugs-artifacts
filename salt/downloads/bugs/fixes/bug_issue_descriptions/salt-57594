**Description**
salt-minion fails startup on Windows 8.1 x86 and x64 when using the Salt-Minion-3000.1-Py3-x86-Setup.exe or Salt-Minion-3000.1-Py3-x64-Setup.exe, due to api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing.

**Setup**
This is actually due to wusa.. Stop the Windows Update service as if you were planning on using saltstack to bootstrap the windows updates.

If its easier, you can use the following packer template from github.com/boxcutter/windows: https://github.com/boxcutter/windows/blob/master/eval-win81x86-enterprise.json Most of the templates using the evaluation iso will have this issue actually.

Do something like `packer build eval-win81x86-enterprise.json`. The eval iso is at http://care.dlservice.microsoft.com/dl/download/B/9/9/B999286E-0A47-406D-8B3D-5B5AD7373A4A/9600.17050.WINBLUE_REFRESH.140317-1640_X64FRE_ENTERPRISE_EVAL_EN-US-IR3_CENA_X64FREE_EN-US_DV9.ISO if you want to pre-download it.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run the installer (I've been using saltify-windows from salt-cloud, but you can run it normally too). It will fail to install the universal crt (http://repo.saltstack.com/windows/dependencies/64/ucrt/) due to using wusa which requires specific windows updates to be installed in order for wusa to work.

One symptom is that you'll see the salt-minion service hasn't automatically started and remains in the pause state. This is due to Python being unable to be executed.

Event log (Setup) will show the following depending on the patch that the salt-minion installer tried to install:
```
Windows update  could not be installed because of error 2147942402 "The system cannot find the file specified." (Command li ne: "wusa  "C:\Users\root\AppData\Local\Temp\nssB607.tmp\Windows8.1-KB2999226-x86.msu" /quiet /norestart")
```

You can prove that the crt didn't install by running `C:\salt\bin\python --version` and it will display an error from the runtime linker: "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing".

**Expected behavior**
Salt-minion service should be running, so then updates can be bootstrapped by salt...since we're trying to use salt-cloud after all. But because Python CRT couldn't install due to wusa the service is "paused" or really dead which requires manually repairing things.

**Versions Report**
salt-Minion-3000.3-Py3-x86-Setup.exe
salt-Minion-3000.3-Py3-x64-Setup.exe

This issue is the exact same one as #56296, and I documented a potential fix for it on that ticket.
