**Description**
Salt-SSH does not install dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04

**Setup**
```
host@user:~/Projects/salt-ssh$ sudo apt-get install salt-ssh
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 salt-ssh : Depends: salt-common (= 3003+ds-1) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```
So when you attempt to install salt-common:
```
host@user:~/Projects/salt-ssh$ sudo apt-get install salt-common

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 salt-common : Depends: python3-zmq (>= 17.0.0) but it is not going to be installed
               Recommends: python3-croniter but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

Which leads me to attempt to manually install those:
```
host@user:~/Projects/salt-ssh$ sudo apt-get install python3-zmq
Reading package lists... Done

python3-zmq is already the newest version (16.0.2-2build2).
