### Description of Issue/Question

Using `salt['grains.filter_by']()` over salt-ssh goes via the wrapper code in `/client/ssh/wrapper/grains.py`. However, using `salt['grains'].filter_by()` or `salt.grains.filter_by()` does not, with no apparent loss of functionality.

I presume this is incorrect behaviour, and it's indicative that the duplicate wrapper code may not even be needed.

See #33911 for background.
### Setup

example1.sls

```
{% set test = salt['grains.filter_by']({}) %}
/tmp/example1:
  file.managed
```

example2.sls

```
{% set test = salt['grains'].filter_by({}) %}
/tmp/example2:
  file.managed
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Edit `def filter_by` under the wrapper to raise an exception:

```
$ salt-ssh '*' state.apply example1
```

fails as expected with `Rendering SLS 'base:example1' failed: Jinja error: ...`, while

```
$ salt-ssh '*' state.apply example2
```

results in `file /tmp/example2 created`.
