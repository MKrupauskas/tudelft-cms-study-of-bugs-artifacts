**Description**
in windows before the release of powershell 7 the only to official shells were `cmd` which is the default shell and `powershell 5.1` 

And it was ok. However powershell 7 introduced something new into the world and now you can't use powershell 7 as the shell in salt because the shell option for cmd.run ignores everything except `powershell` which uses the system default powershell. 



**Setup**
salt on windows

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

```
PS C:\salt\bin\Lib\site-packages\salt-3001.1-py3.7.egg\salt\grains> c:\salt\salt-call cmd.run_all 'Write-Output test' shell='c:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe'
[ERROR   ] Command 'chcp 437 > nul & Write-Output test' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] stderr: 'Write-Output' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
[ERROR   ] retcode: 1
local:
    ----------
    pid:
        27816
    retcode:
        1
    stderr:
        'Write-Output' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.
    stdout:
PS C:\salt\bin\Lib\site-packages\salt-3001.1-py3.7.egg\salt\grains>
```

The command shown does run fine under either powershell. 

```
PS C:\salt\bin\Lib\site-packages\salt-3001.1-py3.7.egg\salt\grains> chcp 437 > nul & Write-Output test

Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command

test
```


**Expected behavior**
using shell I would be able to use powershell 7. just as in Linux I can use shell to set the shell that Linux runs the command with.
