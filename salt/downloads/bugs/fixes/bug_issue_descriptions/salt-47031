### Description of Issue/Question

On CentOS 7, ```modules/timezone.py``` correctly reads whether the hwclock is set to UTC by using timedatectl. However when setting it, it does this...
```
    elif 'RedHat' in __grains__['os_family']:
        __salt__['file.sed'](
            '/etc/sysconfig/clock', '^ZONE=.*', 'ZONE="{0}"'.format(timezone))
```
... which does nothing. This results in the highstate saying this every time but never doing anything...
```
----------
          ID: UTC
    Function: timezone.system
      Result: True
     Comment: Set UTC to True

              ----------
              utc:
                  True
```

### Setup
State:
```
UTC:
  timezone.system:
    - utc: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Take a CentOS 7 server and ensure it has a hwclock set to localtime:
```
# timedatectl set-local-rtc true
```

Apply the above state.

Notice that on every run the state reports changes, however nothing ever does...
```
# timedatectl 
.
 RTC in local TZ: yes
.
```
