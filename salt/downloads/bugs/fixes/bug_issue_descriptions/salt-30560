The versionlock plugin for yum does not allow locks to be deleted with the package name alone:

``` bash
[root@cent6 ~]# yum versionlock list
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, versionlock
2:vim-enhanced-7.4.629-5.el6.*
versionlock list done
[root@cent6 ~]# yum versionlock delete vim-enhanced
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, versionlock
Error: Error: versionlock delete: no matches
[root@cent6 ~]# yum versionlock delete '2:vim-enhanced-7.4.629-5.el6.*'
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, versionlock
Deleting versionlock for: 2:vim-enhanced-7.4.629-5.el6.*
versionlock deleted: 1
[root@cent6 ~]# yum versionlock list
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, versionlock
versionlock list done
```

By contrast, the dnf versionlock plugin does allow you to do so.

This bug exists in `2015.5` and must be fixed there and allowed to merge-forward into the `2015.8` and `develop` branches
