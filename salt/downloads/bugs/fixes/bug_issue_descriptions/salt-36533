### Description of Issue/Question

When `python-psutil` (in my case 0.5.1-1) is installed, salt-minion fails to start with message:

```
# salt-minion 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-minion", line 26, in <module>
    salt_minion()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 109, in salt_minion
    import salt.cli.daemons
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cli/daemons.py", line 46, in <module>
    from salt.utils import parsers, ip_bracket
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/parsers.py", line 28, in <module>
    import salt.config as config
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/config/__init__.py", line 93, in <module>
    _DFLT_IPC_WBUFFER = _gather_buffer_space() * .5
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/config/__init__.py", line 82, in _gather_buffer_space
    total_mem = psutil.virtual_memory().total
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'virtual_memory'
```

Purging (debian speak for removing) `python-psutil` makes salt-minion start up just fine.
### Setup

debian 7 amd64 with python-psutil and salt-minion 2016.3.3 installed
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

### Versions Report
