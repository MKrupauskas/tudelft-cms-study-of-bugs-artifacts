Running latest develop. I have a minion, dufresne, set up as a peer with full power:

```
peer:
    dufresne:
        - .*
```

Pinging that minion from the master works:

```
[root@saltmaster ~]# salt dufresne test.ping
dufresne:
    True
```

Having that minion ping itself from the master returns nothing:

```
[root@dufresne ~]# salt-call publish.publish dufresne test.ping
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Publishing 'test.ping' to tcp://<redacted>:4506
```

Perhaps I'm doing something wrong?
