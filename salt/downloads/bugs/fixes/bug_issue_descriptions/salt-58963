**Description**
Issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/58191 hasn't been fixed. hgfs fileserver still doesn't work even after applying https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/58852

**Setup**
```
fileserver_backend:
  - hgfs

hgfs_remotes:
  - http://repo.com/my_repo  # replace by a valid repo url
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
`salt-run fileserver.file_list base hgfs` always shows nothing

**Expected behavior**
Get files from hgfs fileserver backend

**Versions Report**
current master 

**Research**
As long as I can find, the main reason is that `hglib` returns binary strings and salt expects standard python3 strings. In search for branch there is comparison between binary string returned from hglib (for example b'default') and target branch from saltenv (for example 'default'). This comparison is always False. So `_get_branch` function in `_get_ref` can't find branches.
