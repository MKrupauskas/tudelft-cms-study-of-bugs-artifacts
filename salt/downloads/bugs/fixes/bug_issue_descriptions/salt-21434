When using a non-standard port for SSH, salt-cloud fails to bootstrap a newly created EC2 instance. 

Use case: we run sshd on a port other than 22 in all of our EC2 instances in AWS.  

Reproduce:  specify an AMI in your profile which has sshd running on a port other than 22.  The instance will be created, but the bootstrapping will fail.  

This issue exists in 2014.7.1 as well as in the develop branch.   I have a fix for this tested and ready to be reviewed.
