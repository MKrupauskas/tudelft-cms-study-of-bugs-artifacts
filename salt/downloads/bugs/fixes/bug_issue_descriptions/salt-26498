When testing the changes made in #26479 I discovered that you can create VMs that have the same name across various providers, as long as you only do so once per provider. 

For example, if you create a VM named `nt-1` in Linode, which returns successfully, and then try to create another VM also named `nt-1` in Digital Ocean, the second VM will also get created successfully. Only one VM will be visible in `salt-key -L` (presumably the last one created), but both VMs are present in their respective cloud hosts, resulting in this situation when trying to delete VMs:

```
# salt-cloud -d nt-1
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
  linode-config:
    linode:
      nt-1
  digital_ocean:
    digital_ocean:
      nt-1
  ec2-config:
    ec2:
      nt-1

Proceed? [N/y]
```

This is related to the concerns raised in #16356, and those should be addressed when this is fixed since they're related. However, from a salt-cloud perspective, we should **not** be allowing VMs to be created with the same name across providers.

Note that the appropriate errors are raised if `nt-1` attempts to be created on a host that already contains `nt-1` if it's on the same provider.

I mainly tested this on the 2015.8 branch:

```
# salt-cloud --versions

          system: Ubuntu 14.04 trusty
```

I also ran one test on the 2015.5 branch, and it also exhibits this behavior.
