**Description**
Running a `state.highstate` where one of the tasks performs a `salt.function` with `cmd.run` with `ls -l`.
The whole output of this job is replaced by data from the `ls -l` (actually only the first column from it).
Thereby completely destroying the regular output that was (likely) also returned.

This is not easily repeatable, so I suspect a race condition of some kind.

**Setup**
configure a state `salt.function` with arguments `cmd.run` and `ls -l`.
configure some other states as well.

**Steps to Reproduce the behaviour**
run `state.apply`.
The expected return value has a list of minions, each with a list of tasks.
In this case, the output from `jobs.list_job` did not contain a list of minions and their tasks as expected.
Instead, it was filled with output from `ls`:
```json
{
    "return": [
        {
            "jid": "20201117213929593188",
            "Function": "bbb.txt",
            "Arguments": [
                "ccc.txt",
                "ddd.txt",
                "eee.txt",
                "state.apply"
            ],
            "Target": "aaa.txt",
            "Target-type": "glob",
            "User": "sudo_erwindon",
            "StartTime": "2020, Nov 17 21:39:29.593188",
            "Result": {}
        }
    ]
}
```
Note that the first filename is placed in `Target`, the second one in `Function` and the remaining ones and an extra `state.apply` in `Arguments`.
(the actual filenames that were listed are redacted).

**Expected behaviour**
A regular state output of `state.apply` with the list of minions and their states.
