### Description of Issue/Question

When trying to use file.replace in a state with 'ignore_if_missing' set to True I would receive 'file not found' error instead of reporting no changes needed as specified in the docs.

### Setup
```
/tmp/test:
  file.replace:
    - ignore_if_missing: True
    - pattern: test1
    - repl: test2
```

Output received:
----------
          ID: /tmp/test
    Function: file.replace
      Result: False
     Comment: /tmp/test: file not found

Appears that call to _check_file is causing method to return before state module could account for ignore_if_missing was set.

Expected output:
----------
          ID: /tmp/test
    Function: file.replace
      Result: True
     Comment: No changes needed to be made
