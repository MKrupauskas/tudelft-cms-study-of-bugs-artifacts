Tested against 2016.3.3 (Boron) using augeas.change with test=True

when running a state with test=True that includes augeas.change None is returned rather than True with a comment including commands that would be run.

This can be seen in the state code (salt/states/augeas.py) on line 267. Looking at the code it does not matter what the contents of the state are - all states will return None when test=True.

This result is in contradiction to what should be returned since there is no test run showing things would be changed as a result of the state being applied. Ideally this would return true and then report which commands would be run to test if a change would be applied.
