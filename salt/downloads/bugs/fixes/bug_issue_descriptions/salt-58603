**Description**
When applying zabbix_host.present state to an existent host on Zabbix it fails by numerous errors:

- With Zabbix >= 5.0, the element "bulk" is not present in the hostinterfaces_get output. So it fails when "popped"
- When current and new inventory were missing, the state fails trying to iterate a boolean
- The update_interfaces try to delete all interfaces and then recreate them. That doesn't works as any interface with assigned items can't be deleted. Also, every host needs at least one default interface.

**Setup**
Slackware machines running Salt 3001 managing hosts in a Zabbix 5.0 server, also running on Slackware. The rendered state being applied is:
```
create-zabbix-host-bat.mylab:
  zabbix_host.present:
    - _connection_user: XXXXXXXXXX
    - _connection_password: XXXXXXXXXX
    - _connection_url: http://XXXXXXXXX/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php
    - host: bat.mylab
    - visible_name: Cobra BAT
    - require_in:
      - assign-template-host-bat.mylab
    - groups:
      - Linux Desktops
    - interfaces:
      - 127.0.0.1_agent:
        - interface1: None
        - ip: 127.0.0.1
        - dns: bat.mylab
        - useip: False
        - type: agent
        - port: 10050
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Write a state using zabbix_host.present that updates an existing host on Zabbix.

- inventory error

**Expected behavior**
To apply the state in an already existing host in Zabbix and having the entry updated to the state specified.
