Steps to reproduce:

```
C:\Windows\system32>C:\salt\salt-call.bat --local file.join 'foo' 'bar'
'file.join' is not available.
```

I suspect the issue here is that on windows, the `file` module is provided by `bin/Lib/site-packages/salt/modules/win_file.py`, which imports some, but not all, of the functions from the regular `file.py` module. Ideally `win_file.py` would import symbols without using an explicit list, so issues like this wouldn't crop up in the future, but I don't know enough about it to know whether that's possible.
