salt-2014.1.4-1.el6.noarch
Raven version 5.0
Sentry from getsentry.com

Salt is unable to log entries into Sentry using the documented configuration settings. I have seen one post that suggest Raven 3.5 is needed. but I am not certain.  Note, I have not found an easy method to obtain the older version of Raven.

Configuration:

```
#Minion Pillar
raven:
  servers:
    - https://app.getsentry.com/
  public_key: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
  secret_key: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
  project: 11111
  tags:
    - roles
    - environment
```

```
#/etc/salt/master
sentry_handler:
  dsn: https://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb@app.getsentry.com/11111
  log_level: all
```

Output:

When starting salt master

```
