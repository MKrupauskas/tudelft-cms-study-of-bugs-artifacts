### Description of Issue/Question

(Background: adding `rabbitmq` service to `public` zone)

Running `state.apply test=True` shows the service will be added:

    ----------
              ID: firewall_public_zone
        Function: firewalld.present
            Name: public
          Result: None
         Comment: Configuration for 'public' will change.

                          - ssh
                          - wso2

However, running `state.apply` says the zone has not been modified because it's already in the desired state:

    ----------
              ID: firewall_public_zone
        Function: firewalld.present
            Name: public
          Result: True
         Comment: 'public' is already in the desired state.

         Changes:

On the minion, the service has not been added:

    firewall-cmd --list-all
    public (active)
     target: default
     icmp-block-inversion: no
     interfaces: eno16777984
