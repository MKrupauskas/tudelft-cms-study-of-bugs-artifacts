In Ubuntu (and possibly other distributions), the order of host names in a line in `/etc/hosts` matters, at least for 127.0.1.1.

For example, the following causes `dnsdomainname` to return `example.com`:

```
127.0.1.1 foo.example.com foo
```

while the following does not:

```
127.0.1.1 foo foo.example.com
```

With an SLS file that contains the following:

```
foo:
  host.present:
    - ip: 127.0.1.1
    - names:
      - foo.example.com
      - foo
```

I expect Salt to ensure that the hostnames are listed in `/etc/hosts` in the given order.  Alas, if `foo` is already present, `foo.example.com` is appended.
