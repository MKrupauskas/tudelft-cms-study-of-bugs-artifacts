Given a minion which has no jobs scheduled:

```
[ec2-user@aws-management ~]$ sudo salt 'www4*' schedule.list                                                                              
www4.example.com:
    ----------
    schedule:
        ----------
```

When pushing a `schedule.present` for the first time I would expect `Result: True` but instead I get `Result: Clean`

```
[ec2-user@aws-management ~]$ sudo salt --state-output=changes 'www4*' state.sls_id php-fpm-memory-leak-workaround php54                   
www4.example.com:
  ...[redact 17 clean states which were requirements of the schedule.present]...
  Name: php-fpm-memory-leak-workaround - Function: schedule.present - Result: Clean

Summary
-------------
Succeeded: 18
Failed:     0
-------------
Total states run:     18
```

Next I checked and saw that it did actually apply the state luckily:

```
[ec2-user@aws-management ~]$ sudo salt 'www4*' schedule.list
www4.example.com:
    schedule:
      php-fpm-memory-leak-workaround:
        args:
        - php-fpm
        enabled: true
        function: service.reload
        jid_include: true
        maxrunning: 1
        name: php-fpm-memory-leak-workaround
        seconds: 3600
        splay: 600
```

Edit: I noticed the next command I ran, with `test=True` ended up showing a diff when I would expect it to be `Result: Clean`:

```
[ec2-user@aws-management ~]$ sudo salt --state-output=changes 'www*' state.sls_id php-fpm-memory-leak-workaround php54 test=True          
www4.example.com:
