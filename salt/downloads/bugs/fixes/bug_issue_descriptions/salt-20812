I've been unable to use a git repo with no sub directories at a mountpoint with `file.recurse`.

My guess is that because mountpoints aren't appearing in `cp.list_master_dirs`, for similar reasons, it also isn't being seen by `file.recurse` as a directory. I should be able to work around this by placing the files in my `sphinx` repo into a sub directory for now, but that shouldn't be required.

``` yaml
$ salt minion.example.com state.highstate test=True
