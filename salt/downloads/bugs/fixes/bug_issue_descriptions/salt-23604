I have an service.dead State in my setup. 
On my Minions with systemd i get an "Command Excection" error Message.

The message reported that "systemctl is-active <service>.service" exited with exit code 3.

Exit code 3 is the correct exit code from this command.
I think there shouldn't be a error message.

I use Salt 2014.7.5.
