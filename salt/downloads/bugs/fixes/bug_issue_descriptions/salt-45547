### Description of Issue/Question

I setuped salt to use salt.returners.pgjsonb (as recommanded for postgres) as a returner for my master.

I see that my database is growing and growing and old entries are never removed. 

It seems there is no cleanup function but one seems to exists in one postgres module, `postgres_local_cache.clean_old_jobs`.

What should be done ?

The documentation dosen't specfy it, but I should use `postgres_local_cache` if I want cleanup ?
There is a bug and entries should be cleanup ?
I should cleanup things manually ?

Thanks,

### Setup

```
returner.pgjsonb.host: '127.0.0.1'
returner.pgjsonb.user: 'salt_cache'
returner.pgjsonb.pass: ''
returner.pgjsonb.db: 'salt_cache'
returner.pgjsonb.port: 5432

master_job_cache: pgjsonb
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use pgjsonb, run stuff, wait >24h, entries are not deleted.
