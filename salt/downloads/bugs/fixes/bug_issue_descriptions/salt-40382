### Description of Issue/Question

With the latest git develop branch, it seems salt-cloud emits the _whole_ `bootstrap-salt.sh` script as a result of a command line interactive invocation, under `deploy_kwargs:script`

Is this output really necessary? Because it becomes _much_ harder now to parse the output of the `salt-cloud` command, as I have to scroll through _thousands_ of lines of shellscript that I have no interest in.

(As I always invoke salt in a `tmux` session, I found that I have to increase the size of the rollback buffer to about 20'000 lines before I can see the output of keys prior to `deploy_kwargs:script`)

Is there a way to suppress the output of `deploy_kwargs:script`?


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Install latest git develop
2. Create a cloud map file
3. Trigger creation of cloud servers using `salt-cloud -m $mapfile`
4. Wait until salt-cloud finishes
