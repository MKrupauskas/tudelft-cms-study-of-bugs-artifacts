After deleting tag deleted-tag in github repo (deleted-tag is present in local git repo) git.latest produced these output:
```
          ID: repo
    Function: git.latest
        Name: git@github.com:me/repo.git
      Result: True
     Comment: Repository /home/me/repo is up-to-date

              ----------
              new_tags:
                  - deleted-tag
```
It's strange and confusing that this is reported as new_tags, because this is not newly added. It was there before and was only deleted in remote repo. I have not seen this change with older salt versions.
IMO this tag should be deleted in this case to keep repo up-to-date.
