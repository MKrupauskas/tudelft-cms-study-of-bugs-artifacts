Salt-cloud is broken for VMware in 2016.9.  Trying to create a machine in VMware gives me this error 

```
Error: There was a profile error: The VM/template that you have specified under clonefrom does not exist
```

Also, trying to run `salt-cloud --list-images vsphere01` and `salt-cloud -Q vsphere01` returns nothing. 

```
salt-cloud --list-images vsphere01
vsphere01:
    ----------
    vmware:
        ----------
```

If I downgrade to 2016.3.3 it is working correctly.
