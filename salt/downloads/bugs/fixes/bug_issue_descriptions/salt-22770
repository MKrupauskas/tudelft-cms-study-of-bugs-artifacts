I'm trying to check whether a formula is running and use that to effect a template.  Basically I want to have the output of `state.show_top` available either in grains or in pillar.

Here's the example pillar snippet I'm using:

```
highstate:
  - {{ salt['state.show_top']() }}
```

This manages to completely freeze the salt master when running `pillar.items` and I have to restart both minion and master.

Let me know if there is a better way to do this, but I'm trying to use the top file to control what behaviour certain formulas have.  I.e, backup. 

I want to be able to say "well if postgres is installed, then make sure it's backed up", almost like an optional dependency.

So I figure if we just check the highstate file to see whether it's meant to be running, then we can use that information to build the backup script.
