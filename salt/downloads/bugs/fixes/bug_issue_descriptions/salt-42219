This is a separate issue for the problems described later on in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/42117, where the GCE pricing page is apparently now being served with gzip compression, which then causes the `update_pricing()` call to fail since it's trying to json decode a raw gzipped bytestring.

Basically, the underlying cause is that there's no facility for decompressing retrieved content.
