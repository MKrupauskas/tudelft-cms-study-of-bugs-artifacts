My state had the following:

``` yaml
Ensure redis.conf is present:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/redis/redis.conf
    - source: salt://redis/redis.conf
    - template: jinja
    - listen_in:
      - supervisord: redis
```

But I had removed my supervisord state for redis. This resulted in a stack trace:

```
KeyError: ('supervisord', 'redis')
