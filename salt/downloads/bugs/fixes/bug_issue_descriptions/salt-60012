**Description**
version 3003 of the salt-minion is not starting on macOS Big Sur (at least not for me)

```
salt-minion -V
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/salt/bin/salt-minion", line 6, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

    raise DistributionNotFound(req, requirers)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'pyobjc-framework-AutomaticAssessmentConfiguration==6.2.2; platform_release >= "19.0"' distribution was not found and is required by pyobjc
```

previous version 3002.6 worked as expected.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Install salt-minion 3003 on macOS Big Sur

**Expected behavior**
salt-minion starts
