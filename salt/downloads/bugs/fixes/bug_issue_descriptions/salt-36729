### Description of Issue/Question

When attempting to start multiple minion processes the second minion process does not shutdown properly. Let me show an example to better explain:

I currently do not have any minion processes running:

```
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# ps axu | grep -i salt                         
root       278  0.0  0.0   9048   848 ?        S+   22:14   0:00 grep --color=auto -i salt
```

I start a minion in the backgroun as shown below (this is working as expected)

```
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# salt-minion -d
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# 
```

But when I attempt to start another minion (i know this will not work in general unless changing values, but I woul expect for the minion to not startup and shutdown properly, but i get the following)

```
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# salt-minion -d
The Salt Minion is shutdown.
```

And it just hangs there indefinitely. And when I hit Ctrl + C it stack traces as follows:

```
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# salt-minion -d
The Salt Minion is shutdown.
^CProcess Process-1:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 261, in _bootstrap
    util._exit_function()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/util.py", line 319, in _exit_function
    p.join()
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 145, in join
    res = self._popen.wait(timeout)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/forking.py", line 154, in wait
    return self.poll(0)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/multiprocessing/forking.py", line 135, in poll
    pid, sts = os.waitpid(self.pid, flag)
KeyboardInterrupt
```

When running this on 2016.3.3 for example this is working as expected as shown below:

```
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# salt-minion -d
[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# salt-minion -d
The salt minion is shutdown.[root@7bb88b856c2e testing]# 
```
### Setup
1. just need a minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

   a. `salt-minion -d`
   b. `salt-minion -d` (or run it in the foreground `salt-minion -ldebug`)
Note: might be related to issue or even a duplicate of the issue: #36304 make note of the comments at the bottom of that issue. This is the same behavior as documented in that issue but I am seeing it by running completely different steps.
