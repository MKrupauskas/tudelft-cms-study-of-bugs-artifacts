### Description of Issue/Question
When executing `wheel.error.error`, an unexpected internal error occurs.
The original purpose of this function is to raise an error. But it should be the specified error.

I believe the error is due to the code in file `salt/utils/error.py`.
There is exception handling around `import exceptions` which is triggered as under Python3 this package does not exist,
But on lines 28/29, the `exceptions` object is still used, thus raising an unwanted exception.
When I comment these 2 lines, the function works as expected for a custom error.

Note that a similar situation is properly handled in `salt/_compat.py`.

### Setup
Default installation with just a salt-master and a salt-minion on the same machine.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
$ salt HOSTNAME saltutil.wheel error.error "Exception" "This is an error."
HOSTNAME:
    ----------
    _stamp:
        2018-08-16T09:30:10.582247
    fun:
        wheel.error.error
    fun_args:
        - Exception
        - This is an error.
    jid:
        20180816113010567620
    return:
        Exception occurred in wheel error.error: Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 387, in _low
            data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
          File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/salt/wheel/error.py", line 30, in error
            salt.utils.error.raise_error(name=name, message=message)
          File "/usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages/salt/utils/error.py", line 28, in raise_error
            elif hasattr(exceptions, name):
        NameError: name 'exceptions' is not defined
    success:
        False
    user:
        UNKNOWN
