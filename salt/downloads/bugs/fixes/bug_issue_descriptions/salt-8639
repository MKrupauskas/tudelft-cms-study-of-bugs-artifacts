Installing a pip package behind a proxy works fine. However, when specifying a bin_env, the proxy seems to be ignored.

buildbot/master.sls

```
buildbot_master_venv:
    virtualenv.managed:
        - name: /opt/buildbot/venv

buildbot:
    pip.installed:
        - proxy: {{pillar['http_proxy']}}
        - bin_env: /opt/buildbot/venv/bin/pip
```

Calling state.highstate for a Ubuntu host gives 

```
