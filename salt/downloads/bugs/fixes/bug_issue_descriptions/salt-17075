**Version**: 2014.7.0rc5

Not sure if this is a bug, or how it is suppose to work, but it appears that the salt-minion does not send the newjob or ret event for startup_states.  I do see a salt/auth and a start event when the minion starts though.

Would be really useful to to have the salt minion report a new_job event and send a return event for startup_states: highstate.

I'm building a UI to be able to review and monitor all return events for errors, bugs, and odd behavior.

Thanks.
