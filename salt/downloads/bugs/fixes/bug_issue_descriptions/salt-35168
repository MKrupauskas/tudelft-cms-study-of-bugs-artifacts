Have a state which has a file.managed from S3:

```
my_download:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/file
    - source: s3://bucket/file
    - source_hash: sha512=s3://bucket/file.sha512
```

Use the above state, will receive this error:

`Comment: Specified sha512 checksum for s3://bucket/file (s3://bucket/file.sha512) does not match actual checksum (checksum)`
