Hi,

If i upgrade a 0.16.3 minion on a Windows 2008R2, the salt-minion.exe is not updated, so the minion service can't start.

If i uninstall 0.16.3 version first, it's OK.

I think salt-minion.exe is in use and can't be updated. Perhaps the service must be stopped before upgrading ?

Regards
Pierre
