The state that I am applying looks like this which is very close to what the documentation specifies:

``` salt
AWS-SecurityGroup:
    boto_secgroup.present:
        - name: cloudhero
        - description: My security group
        - rules:
            - ip_protocol: tcp
              from_port: 80
              to_port: 80
              cidr_ip:
                - 10.0.0.0/8
                - 192.168.0.0/16
        - region: us-east-1
        - keyid: <keyid>
        - key: <key>
```

The result after running this state is:

``` salt

----------
          ID: AWS-SecurityGroup
    Function: boto_secgroup.present
        Name: cloudhero

I looks to me there might be two issues here:
1. The security group will get created but rules are not added.
2. The configuration could not be retrieved

Since the security group gets created in my AWS account but without any of the rules I can only speculate the VPC name or ID shouldn't be required. 

Nevertheless, most people will have only one VPC anyways and having to specify the vpc mandatory makes things quite inflexible.

I tried this on the latest version of 2015.8 from git also.
