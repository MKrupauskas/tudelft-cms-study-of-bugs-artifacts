We use salt-api to let an external system authenticate to salt-master. Files for expired tokens don't seem to be deleted from /var/cache/salt/tokens.

For example after 5 days there are over 9000 tokens cached and 90% of them expired.

I can see they are deleted in salt.auth.LoadAuth.get_tok() but we never reach that point as we regenerate the token whenever we see it has expired on the remote system.

Also note that in get_tok():

``` python
### this would be checked by the if below ###
if 'expire' not in tdata:
    # invalid token, delete it!
    rm_tok = True
### '0' won't compare well with float ###
if tdata.get('expire', '0') < time.time():  
    rm_tok = True
```
