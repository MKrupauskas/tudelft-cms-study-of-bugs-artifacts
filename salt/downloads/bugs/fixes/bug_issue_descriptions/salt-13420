When salt-cloud boots a VM, it always places the virtual machine's public key in /etc/salt/minion. --no-deploy does NOT disable this option.

There should be an option that the user can specify in salt-cloud that says "do not add pub key for minion set up."

Also, i do not think that --no-deploy should be the way this is done. I should be able to control whether a key is added or not, regardless of whether i want to run a boot script.
