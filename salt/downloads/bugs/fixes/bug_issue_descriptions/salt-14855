I installed Salt using the bootstrap script, and when I do a versions report, there is an `n/a` in the versioning number for Salt itself:

```
# salt --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.7.0-n/a-8b2cbbb
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.3.0
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
        libnacl: Not Installed
         PyYAML: 3.10
          ioflo: Not Installed
          PyZMQ: 14.0.1

```

@s0undt3ch - I think this might be related to your changes to the versioning system.
