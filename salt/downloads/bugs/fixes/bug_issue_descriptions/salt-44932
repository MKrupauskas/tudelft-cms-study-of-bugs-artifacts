### Description of Issue/Question

When a facl is applied to a directory, it is possible that future changes to the directory done outside Salt to go undetected. 

### Setup / Steps to Reproduce Issue

No FACL on /var/log/httpd looks like:
```
$ getfacl httpd/

# file: httpd/
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::---
other::---
```

The follow state is applied so that the webmaster group can see Apache logs:
```
'Webmasters Can See HTTP Logs'::
  acl.present:
    - name: /var/log/httpd
    - acl_type: group
    - acl_name: webmaster
    - perms: rx
```
Which results in the following:
```
$ getfacl httpd/

# file: httpd/
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::---
group:webmaster:r-x
mask::r-x
other::---
```
Time passes, and Apache releases an update which is applied to the system.  This ends up changing the FACL to (note the difference in mask):
```
$ getfacl httpd/

# file: httpd/
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
group::---
group:webmaster:r-x		#effective:---
mask::---
other::---
```
However a highstate does not detect the change and it goes unnoticed by sysadmins until the webmasters point it out.
