### Description of Issue/Question
Using just `password_hash` I get an error if I try to change a user password with MySQL > 8 / MariaDB 10.x.

The relevant part is here:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/mysql.py#L1540

The `password` variable is undefined if the state uses `password_hash`. `password_sql` contains the hashed password from the state. AFAIK there is no way to just set the password hash with `ALTER USER`. Maybe this could be changed to `SET PASSWORD ...`?

### Setup
```yaml
mariadb.testuser:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: testuser
    - host: localhost
    - password_hash: '*94BDCEBE19083CE2A1F959FD02F964C7AF4CFC29'
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I get the following error:
```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1933, in call

                File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1939, in wrapper
