```
>>> salt minion state.highstate`
>>> salt minion state.highstate
minion:
    'state.highstate' is not available.
```

```
>>> salt-call state.highstate
[... successful output ...]
>>> salt-call state.highstate
Function state.highstate is not available
```

As the output shows: first call returns nothing (or the successful output on the minion). Second call returns an error.

salt-version: 2014.1.10 release
os-version: openSUSE 12.3

~~Our setup relies on an ssh-reverse proxy setting to tunnel the two ports required by salt from the remote host to our salt-master. I am not sure what causes this behavior. When keeping a minion in our own network under salt control it seems works without any issues. Could be timeout problem.~~
We also have this problem on minions inside our network.

This helped https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/salt-users/ekKjhKEkVEs/3jZ5vfiaZDkJ . However, always calling `rm -Rf /var/cache/salt` on the minion in order to run state.higstate on the master/minion, seems quite akward.
