### Description of Issue/Question

[`salt.states.virt.running` calls `virt.vm_state`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/virt.py#L405) to determine if the VM is already running, and if the result is anything other than the literal string `running`, it then updates it (if `update: True` is set in the state), and then [tries to start the VM](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/virt.py#L422).

But [`salt.states.modules.vm_state`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/4573c01ebf24bf99b53cacc81cb0851ed15309d3/salt/modules/virt.py#L2203-L2243) *always* [returns a `dict`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/4573c01ebf24bf99b53cacc81cb0851ed15309d3/salt/modules/virt.py#L2235), whch means the return value will *never* be the literal string `running`.  (Possibly this once worked, but the definition of `vm_state` was changed?)

This `dict` return can also be seen testing `virt.vm_state` from the command line:

```
ewen@noc:/etc/salt/pillar$ sudo salt 'naosr620.naos.co.nz' virt.vm_state debian_unstable
naosr620.naos.co.nz:
    ----------
    debian_unstable:
        running
ewen@noc:/etc/salt/pillar$ 
```

From a quick glance it appears that `salt.states.virt.running` needs to index into the `dict` it gets back to get the state it is looking for (at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/virt.py#L405; I'm unclear what the purpose of the [call on the previous line](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/virt.py#L404) is, since it seems like it would happen a second time on line 405 anyway, and the result from the call in line 404 is ignored?!).

### Setup

Create a simple `libvirt` VM with `virt.running`:

```
debian_unstable:
    virt.running:
      - cpu: 1
      - mem: 512
      - vm_type: kvm
      - disk_profile: 
      - disks:
          - name: vda
            source_file: /dev/ssd/debian_unstable_vda
            format: raw
            model: virtio
      - install: False
      - nic_profile: 
      - interfaces:
          - name: eth0
            type: bridge
            source: virbr0
            mac: 00:01:02:03:04:05
            model: virtio
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Define a VM with the config above, do `state.highstate` which results in it running again.  Do `state.highstate` a second time, and get the report:

```
ewen@noc:/etc/salt/pillar$ ths naosr620.naos.co.nz
naosr620.naos.co.nz:
----------
          ID: debian_unstable
    Function: virt.running
      Result: False
     Comment: Requested operation is not valid: domain is already running
     Started: 17:04:23.748135
    Duration: 15.583 ms
     Changes:

```

(`ths` is a shell script that does `sudo salt "$@" state.highstate test=True --state-output=changes --output-diff`, because that's a lot to type :-)   Note that `salt.states.virt.running` happens even in `test=True` mode, which seems like a separate bug.)

### Versions Report

salt master is currently on Debian Jessie (8), with Salt 2019.2.0 on Python 2.7; salt minions are all Salt 2019.2.0, and in the case of the minion where I ran into this issue the salt minion is on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Salt 20.19.2.0 on Python 2.7.
