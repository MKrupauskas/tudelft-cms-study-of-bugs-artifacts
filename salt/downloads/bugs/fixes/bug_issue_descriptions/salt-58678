**Description**
Hello,

While analyzing salt on SonarCloud I saw 6 cases of bad string formatting which will raise an `IndexError`. The `str.format` method starts its field indexing at 0, not 1. You can see the [full list of bugs on SonarCloud here](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource_salt&open=AXUIKy3APoEr8CkZiQSV&resolved=false&rules=python%3AS2275).

For example, the following code found in [salt.states.boto_ec2.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/states/boto_ec2.py#L480-L482) will raise an `IndexError` exception.
```
        msg = "Failed to update ENI groups: {1}."
        ret["result"] = False
        ret["comment"] = msg.format(result_update["error"]["message"])
```

**Setup**
There is no setup. This issue was detected by using the SonarCloud online service.
You can run the same analysis in a few clicks. I used [this configuration file](https://github.com/nicolas-harraudeau-sonarsource/salt/commit/aec7a4ce1e0ecad066703cfa9fc5c48378e15a64) to separate properly main code from test code.

**Screenshots**
I will put only one screenshot so that this issue remains short.

**Suggested Fix**
In  the example above, replace the field index in the formatted string with 0 instead of 1.
```
msg = "Failed to update ENI groups: {0}."
```

**Versions Report**
This issue was found directly on the master branch of salt. I didn't check if it was present in any released version.

**Additional context**
In case you have any question, suggestion or if you see a False Positive on SonarCloud you can reach out on [SonarSource community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).

A few notes in case you want to use SonarCloud:
* SonarCloud can easily import pylint and flake8 issues in case you want to use a rule SonarCloud does not already provide. Note however that if you select a rule already covered by SonarCloud you might see different issues than what Pylint/Flake8 report. We design our code analyzers to avoid False Positives as much as possible and to detect complex bugs.
* SonarCloud is free for open-source projects.
