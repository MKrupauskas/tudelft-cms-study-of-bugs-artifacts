#### System:

```
# uname -a
Linux myhost 3.13.0-54-generic #91-Ubuntu SMP Tue May 26 19:15:38 UTC 2015 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux

# lsb_release -a
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
Release:        14.04
Codename:       trusty
```

So, the solution is to provide at this repo 32bit libraries as well.
