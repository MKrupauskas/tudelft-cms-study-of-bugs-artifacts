If I add a repo which uses keyid and keyserver, all is fine and dandy:

java-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://www.duinsoft.nl/pkg debs all
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/duinsoft.list
    - keyid: 5CB26B26
    - keyserver: keys.gnupg.net

But if I add a repo, which does not need anything:

partner-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu precise partner
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/partner.list

It ends up disabled. More precisely the line in the file specified, has a # in front of it.
If I add disabled: False, it works correctly:

partner-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu precise partner
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/partner.list
    - disabled: False

This is counter intuitive and should be the other way around.
