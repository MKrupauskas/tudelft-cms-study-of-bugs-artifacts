### Description of Issue
salt-run manage.versions produces ValueError exception

```python
# salt-run manage.versions
Exception occurred in runner manage.versions: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 387, in _low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/runners/manage.py", line 697, in versions
    minion_version = salt.version.SaltStackVersion.parse(minions[minion])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/version.py", line 269, in parse
    'Unable to parse version string: \'{0}\''.format(version_string)
ValueError: Unable to parse version string: 'ERROR executing 'test.version': Executor 'direct_call.get' is not available'
```

### Setup
Salt-master and 2 minions.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Not quite sure. I think one of the minions was in the middle of being updated when `salt-run manage.versions` was ran.
