Salt version 2014.1.0

The following state is failing because the package is provided by the RHN yum plugin:

```
yum-plugin-protectbase:
  pkg.installed
```

Reviewing the debug info from `salt-call` on the minion, the problematic point is:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'repoquery --queryformat="%{NAME}_|-%{VERSION}_|-%{RELEASE}_|-%{ARCH}_|-%{REPOID}"  --all --quiet --whatprovides \'yum-plugin-protectbase\'' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] The following package(s) were not found, and no possible matches were found in the package db: yum-plugin-protectbase
```

Manually running the same command but with `--plugins` provided resolves the issue:

```
$ repoquery --whatprovides yum-plugin-protectbase --verbose
<no output>

$ repoquery --whatprovides yum-plugin-protectbase --verbose --plugins
Loaded plugins: rhnplugin

```

From an end-user perspective, I'd rather not be concerned with having to specify that the `--plugins` option needs to be specified for certain packages.  It's also very hard to track down the problem when first encountering it since running `yum info` & `yum list` show the package as being available and unless you're aware that salt is instead relying on repoquery internally, you'll be scratching your head for a bit.  That said, I'm not familiar enough with yum plugins to know if always specifying the `--plugins` directive could have drawbacks.
