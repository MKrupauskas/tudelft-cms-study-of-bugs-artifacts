### Description of Issue/Question
After upgrading msgpack to v0.6.1, I get a warning on every remote execution:
```
[WARNING ][77134] /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/payload.py:145: DeprecationWarning: encoding is deprecated, Use raw=False instead.
  ret = msgpack.loads(msg, use_list=True, ext_hook=ext_type_decoder, encoding=encoding)
```
