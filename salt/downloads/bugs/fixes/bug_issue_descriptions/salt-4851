I use the option autosign_file on the master config
First, I add below to the /etc/salt/autosign.conf

```
centos
w2003
```

My windows minion's ID is 'w2003', It run correctly.
But, when I change windows minion's ID to 'w2003_123', master also auto-accept it
Is that correct?
I just want fully-matched!
