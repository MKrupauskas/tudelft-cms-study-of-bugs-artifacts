### Description of Issue/Question
Whenever a minion receives a payload form the master via the PUB channel, it will spawn a thread or (by default) a process to handle it. If many functions are being executed in parallel, this can be a problem because processes consume memory, file descriptors, process descriptors, etc.

### Setup
This has been reproduced with 2016.11 and 2017.7 versions.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
One easy way to reproduce this is:

```
master$ for ((i=0;i<100;i++)); do salt --async MINION test.sleep 3600; done

master$ ssh MINION

minion$ top
```

This is not the normal use case of course, because typically users do not really want to run that many functions all together and group them in states instead.

Using `state.apply` and related functions from the `state` execution module with default options works around the issue, because the `state` functions do not allow more than one instance running in parallel by default (`queue=False`):

```
master$ cat >/srv/salt/sleep.sls <<<"
test:
  module.run:
    - name: test.sleep
    - length: 3 
"

master$ salt MINION state.sls sleep
^C
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c [...]

master$ salt MINION state.sls sleep
mino.tf.local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.sls" is running as PID 30540 and was started at 2017, Sep 21 12:16:58.940803 with jid 20170921121658940803
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

This issue appears with `state.apply` and related functions when using `queue=True` though:

```
master$ for ((i=0;i<100;i++)); do salt --async MINION state.sls sleep queue=True; done
```

`queue=True` is the default in SUSE Manager, which is the reason why we stumbled upon this issue.
