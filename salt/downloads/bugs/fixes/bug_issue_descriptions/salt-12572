Running `salt-call state.highstate --local -l debug` on a yum-based OS displays every single available package in the yum repositories.
This is because the command `repoquery --queryformat="%{NAME}_|-%{ARCH}" --pkgnarrow=all --all` is being executed on every run. With debug enabled it salt-call shows the output of that command.

With just the default CentOS 6.5 repositories enabled that results in 17490 lines of extra output. I had to modify the scrollback length of my terminal emulator to even accommodate for it. I saved those 17490 lines into a file, it's 408 Kilobytes. [Scroll through it](https://gist.github.com/rasschaert/837340dfa62b8db43714#file-repoquery-log) and see for yourself how absolutely massive and pointless it is.

I know that debug output by it's very nature is supposed to be noisy, but the noise to signal ratio here is staggering. How is that list of 17490 packages ever useful to anyone? Has anyone ever needed or used that particular section of the output?

I believe an ocean of text like that is detrimental to actually being able to debug anything. IMHO those 17k lines of repoquery output have no place in the debug output. Curious to hear other views on this.
