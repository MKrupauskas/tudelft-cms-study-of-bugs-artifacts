If I have an SLS file like so:

```
# runs before A and/or B
A:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo A third
    # is running in test mode before C
    # C gets executed first if this states modify something
    - prereq:
      - cmd: B
      - cmd: C

w:
  cmd.wait:
    - name: w if A
    - watch:
      - cmd: A

# always has to run
B:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo B first

# never has to run
C:
  cmd.wait:
    - name: echo C second
```

the test=True run looks like:

```
local:

    Function: cmd.run
        Name: echo A third
      Result: None

```

Not a critical issue since it does actually do what it is supposed to, but the test=True output is a bit misleading.
