I got bit by this bug when I added an external pillar using a git+ssh url with the wrong username. Later on I updated the user portion of the url but my changes never got applied to the cached repo until I manually deleted the cache.

This occurs because salt just checks if the cached repository exists not if the pull url is up to date.

I'm using 0.17.4 but I confirmed this occurs in develop too.
