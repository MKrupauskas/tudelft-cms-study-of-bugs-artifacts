Hi,

I have defined a node group in my master file which I can use ok from the master.

I have peer enabled and I'm able to publish commands between minions via this master as well.

What I am not able to do, is publish a peer command to a node group.

Here is the command I am trying to run:
`salt-call publish.publish boulderqds cmd.run 'grep 874521 /var/log/syslog'`

Here is the exception I am seeing on the master
2014-09-18 21:57:04,796 [salt.master      ][ERROR   ] Error in function minion_pub:
