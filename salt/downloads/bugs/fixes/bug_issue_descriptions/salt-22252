I just updated to `2015.2.0-899-g6566a5d (Lithium)` from `2014.7.2` and the following recipe now fails:

```
testuser:
  user.present: []

'echo foo':
  cron.absent:
    - identifier: test
    - user: testuser
    - hour: '*'
```

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'crontab -l -u testuser' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'crontab /tmp/tmpEdiNjj' as user 'testuser' in directory '/home/testuser'
[ERROR   ] Command 'crontab /tmp/tmpEdiNjj' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] stderr: /tmp/tmpEdiNjj: Permission denied
[ERROR   ] retcode: 1
[ERROR   ] Cron echo foo for user testuser failed to commit with error /tmp/tmpEdiNjj: Permission denied
```

The user is created succesfully but ensuring that the cron is not defined fails for some reason.. I don't see why permissions are denied as /tmp is `drwxrwxrwt  5 root root 4096 Apr  1 16:19 .`
