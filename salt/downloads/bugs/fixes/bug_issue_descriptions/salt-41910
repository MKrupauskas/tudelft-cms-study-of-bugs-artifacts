**Assuming documentation is going to change `priv:` to `ssh_priv:` (or, the for `parsers.SaltSSHOptionParser` to use `dest` of `priv` instead of `ssh_priv`), this issue is trivial**, but to help others googling:

### Description of Issue/Question
[SALT ROSTERS](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/roster.html) documentation page is out of date with respect to version `2016.11.5`, at latest

### Setup
```sh
$ salt-ssh --version
# salt-ssh 2016.11.5 (Carbon)
```

#### create a blank directory with 2 files

##### Saltfile
```yaml
---
salt-ssh:
  priv: path-to-your-private-key
  roster_file: ./roster-file.yml
  ssh_log_file: ./log/salt/ssh
```

##### roster-file.yml

```yaml
testhost:
  host: ip-to-testhost
  user: user-on-testhost
```

obviously, we assume you have access to `testhost`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
$ salt-ssh -i '*' test.ping

# WARNING: CONFIG '/etc/salt' directory does not exist.
# salt-ssh could not be run because it could not generate keys.
# 
# You can probably resolve this by executing this script with increased permissions via sudo or by running as root.
# You could also use the '-c' option to supply a configuration directory that you have permissions to read and write to.
```

### Workaround

in `Saltfile` change `priv` to `ssh_priv`:
```yaml
---
salt-ssh:
  ssh_priv: path-to-your-private-key
  roster_file: ./roster-file.yml
  ssh_log_file: ./log/salt/ssh
```

and run the same command
```
$ salt-ssh -i '*' test.ping

# WARNING: CONFIG '/etc/salt' directory does not exist.
# testhost:
#     True
```
