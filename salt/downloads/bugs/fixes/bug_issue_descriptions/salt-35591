The documentation for the [Linux ACL module](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.linux_acl.html) suggests that naming the file system entry with a `name` attribute should work:

```
/var/log/unattended-upgrades is readable by the NRPE user:
  acl.present:
    - name: /var/log/unatteded-upgrades
    - acl_type: user
    - acl_name: nagios
    - perms: rx
```

Unfortunately I always get a `KeyError` exception:

```
mandorallen:
----------
          ID: /var/log/unattended-upgrades is readable by the NRPE user
    Function: acl.present
        Name: /var/log/unatteded-upgrades
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1733, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1651, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/linux_acl.py", line 69, in present
                  _current_perms = __current_perms[name]
              KeyError: '/var/log/unatteded-upgrades'
     Started: 10:25:28.737175
    Duration: 8.555 ms

However, if I change the state's name to match the directory name like this…

```
/var/log/unattended-upgrades:
  acl.present:
    - acl_type: user
    - acl_name: nagios
    - perms: rx
```

…then things will magically work without a problem.
