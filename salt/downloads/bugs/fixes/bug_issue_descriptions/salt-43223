### Description of Issue/Question
There is a deprecation warning for a function to be removed in the boto_vpc execution module. However, the original deprecation looks incomplete and when #41205 was submitted, the change for the boto files caused test failures.

I need to look into this more closely and find a way forward for the deprecation.
