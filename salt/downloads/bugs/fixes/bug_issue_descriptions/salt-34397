### Description of Issue/Question

Not necessarily an issue or bug, but just as something I've noticed while working with `pkg.version_cmp` that you guys may or may not want to address. I've been working on a cve scan for [HubbleStack](https://github.com/jaredhanson11/Nova/blob/develop/hubblestack_nova/modules/cve_scan_v2.py), and sometimes the vulnerable package version number I grab from an outside source will not correspond exactly to the format given by `pkg.list_pkgs`. It can happen that local version number is `1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.4` while the source of the cve's returns the vulnerable version number as `6.6p1-2ubuntu2.7`, omitting the prefix `1:`. This can cause unwanted behavior by the `pkg.version_cmp` command. I work around it by getting rid of all `x:` prefixes, but it would be nice to have `pkg.version_cmp` handle the discrepancy, or at least return `None` representing an error comparing the versions. 
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
ubuntu@:~$ sudo salt '*' pkg.version_cmp 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.4 6.6p1-2ubuntu2.7

ubuntu@:~$ sudo salt '*' pkg.version_cmp 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.4 1:6.6p1-2ubuntu2.7
myminion:
    -1
```
