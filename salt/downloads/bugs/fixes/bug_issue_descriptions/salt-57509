**Description**
Most grains are missing from grains.items on Fedora 32, when compared to Fedora 31. Notably, os, networking, and cpu grains are absent.

**Setup**
Create a Fedora 32 container:
```
podman run --name f32 --rm -it fedora:32
dnf upgrade -y
dnf install -y salt-minion
```

Create a Fedora 31 container:
```
podman run --name  f31 --rm -it fedora:31
dnf upgrade -y
dnf install -y salt-minion
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Get a list of grains and/or their contents:
```
salt-call --local grains.ls
```

**Expected behavior**
The Fedora 31 container comes back with 70+ lines of output, including OS family:
```
local:
    - SSDs
    - biosreleasedate
    - biosversion
# ... snipped for brevity ... #
    - os
    - os_family
# ... snipped for brevity ... #
    - zmqversion
```

**Screenshots**
The Fedora 32 container comes back with a smaller set of grains and some deprecation warnings:
