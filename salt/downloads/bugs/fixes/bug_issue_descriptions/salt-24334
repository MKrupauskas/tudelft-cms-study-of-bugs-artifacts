When setting `autosign_timeout` in the master config, this is not honoured and the default 120 is still applied.

From looking through masterapi.py, it appears that this is not the option being fetched:
`expire_minutes = self.opts.get('autosign_expire_minutes', 10)`

However, `autosign_expire_minutes` is not a valid option.
