After changing `ext_pillar` value in master config file and restarting salt-master, debug log was still complaining about a problem with the _old_ value. I couldn't find where that value gets cached (reboot didn't help), but eventually I found that deleting `/var/cache/salt/master/pillar_gitfs` solves the problem. Tried a couple more times, always with the same conclusion.

Salt 0.17.2, Ubuntu Raring
