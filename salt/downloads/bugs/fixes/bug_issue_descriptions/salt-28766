We've just started out with Salt and have hit a brick wall almost immediately trying to provision an Ubuntu image on ec2. The instance is created, but the minion is unable to connect due to a key issue. There are two keys created in salt-keys: the minion id supplied to salt-cloud and the ec2 hostname provided by AWS. 

My cloud profile:

```
base-ec2-testing:
  provider: ec2-us-east
  image: ami-d05e75b8
  size: t2.small
  ssh_username: ubuntu
  network_interfaces:
    - DeviceIndex: 0
      PrivateIpAddresses:
        - Primary: True
      AssociatePublicIpAddress: False
      SubnetId: subnet-xxxxxxx
      SecurityGroupId:
        - sg-xxxxxxxx
  del_root_vol_on_destroy: True
  del_all_vol_on_destroy: True
  script: bootstrap-salt
  script_args: -c /tmp/ -P -F -K -A 10.0.1.10
```

The creation command:

```
salt-cloud -p base-ec2-testing test.example.com
```

The keys afterward:

```
root@ops1:~# salt-key
Accepted Keys:
test.example.com
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
ip-10-0-1-187
Rejected Keys:
```

And the output from test.ping:

```
root@ops1:~# salt '*' test.ping
test.example.com:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

On the minion:

```
root@ip-10-0-1-187:~# tail /var/log/salt/minion
