If a VM is created in Azure from salt using the following command:

```
salt-cloud -p win2012r2  tstreuse1
```

then the VM is removed using the command

```
salt-cloud -d tstreuse1
```

Then only the virtual machine is removed from Azure. Not the disks used by the VM and not the associated cloud service.

This causes problem if you would re-run the first command

```
salt-cloud -p win2012r2  tstreuse1
```

Returning exceptions like this

```
[DEBUG   ] Attempting function <function wait_for_hostname at 0x7f8f32870488>
[DEBUG   ] Caught exception in wait_for_fun: local variable 'data' referenced before assignment
[DEBUG   ] Retrying function <function wait_for_hostname at 0x7f8f32870488> on  (try 1)
[DEBUG   ] Caught exception in wait_for_fun: local variable 'data' referenced before assignment
[DEBUG   ] Retrying function <function wait_for_hostname at 0x7f8f32870488> on  (try 2)
```

Clearing the disks from the UI according to [this](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsazure/en-US/7381ea0e-0443-4b33-aa12-ba39df003409/error-deleting-vhd-there-is-currently-a-lease-on-the-blob-and-no-lease-id-was-specified-in-the?forum=WAVirtualMachinesforWindows) fixes the problem and enables you to create the vm with te same name.

This also seems to be noted in the code [msazure.py:455](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/msazure.py#L455). 

My questions/suggestions are:
- Always clear associated disks (and optionally remove the vhds)
- Optionally clear the associated cloud service
- Generate disks with unique names
