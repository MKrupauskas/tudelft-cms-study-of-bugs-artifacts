It seems like `event.fire_master` doesn't like it when a NACL Encrypted pillar is being used.
In a normal highstate (which uses the same pillar) it works just fine, except when a state is triggered via `event.fire_master` which results in:

```
    "id": "server.example.net", 
    "jid": "20151013153248748152", 
    "out": "highstate", 
    "retcode": 5, 
    "return": [
        "Pillar failed to render with the following messages:", 
        "Rendering SLS 'nodes.example' failed. Please see master log for details."
    ], 
    "success": true
```

I couldn't find the particular error in the log though (since a LOT happens when two minions are executing states, loading pillars etc at the same time)

The pillar looks like this:

```
stuff:
  some-stuff:
    type: blah
    pass: {{ salt.nacl.dec('XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX') }}
```
