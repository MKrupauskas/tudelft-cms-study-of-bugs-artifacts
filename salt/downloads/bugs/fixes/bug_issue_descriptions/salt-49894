### Description of Issue/Question

pkgrepo.managed is not correctly recognizing the architecture for apt based systems when running with test=true. with below scenario test=true always return a change even the repository is correctly setup.

it does not work with the following variations:
* having `[arch=amd64]` in the name attribute of the pkgrepo.managed state
* having `architecture: amd64` as attribute of the pkgrepo.managed state

### Setup
sls
```
salt_minion_repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/18.04/amd64/latest bionic main
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/saltstack.list
    - key_url: salt://{{ slspath }}/files/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. create file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/saltstack.list` on salt minion containing the repository with `[arch=amd64]`
2. run highstate against the minion with `test=true` => should show a change (NOT OK)
3. run highstate against the minion with `test=false` => not showing a change (OK)
