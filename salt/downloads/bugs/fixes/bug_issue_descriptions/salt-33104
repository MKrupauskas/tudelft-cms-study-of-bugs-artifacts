  I am trying to install a package that is on the salt master or salt-ssh host with sources. It is in the documentation. It seems to be a feature dating back to at least 2013.

```
State:
install_wkhtmltox:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - wkhtmltox: salt://wkhtmlox.deb


Results:
----------
          ID: install_wkhtmltox
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
