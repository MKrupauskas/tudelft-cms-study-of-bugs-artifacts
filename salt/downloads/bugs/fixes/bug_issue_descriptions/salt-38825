The environment that I'm currently deploying salt in already has a pair of synchronised file servers which I am using to store large installation media files and deploy them to minions over HTTP.

I'm adding multiple source lines to provide redundancy in the event that one server is down. My configuration looks like

```
file_redundency_example:
  file.managed:
    - source:
      - http://host1/path/to/file
      - http://host2/path/to/file
```

However, If host 1 is down I get an error rather than a failover to host2 such as

```
