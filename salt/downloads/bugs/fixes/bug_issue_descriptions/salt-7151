If you upgrade the minion on debian from 0.16.3 through salt, the minion will kill itself off before the upgrade has finished. This leaves the packages in a stuck state and manual intervention is required.

To work around it, the following seems to work:

salt 'MINION' at.at 'now + 1 minute' "apt-get install -y salt-minion"

New packages will be built and tested over the next 24 hours or so, but it appears that this work around will be needed to get off 0.16.3

Apologies for this,

Joe
