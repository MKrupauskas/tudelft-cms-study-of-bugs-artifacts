If someone issues `salt 'hostname' state.highstate` from the master it is executed and the results are sent back to the master. With the event system you can do nice stuff (like salt-eventsd) such as storing when a highstate was executed and what the results were.

However, if you call `salt-call state.highstate` from the minion it _is_ communicating with the master (since it needs states & files) but no data gets sent back and no events are being raised. As a result no events are being logged (e.g. with salt-eventsd).

This opens op the possibility that the minion was highstated without the master's knowledge.

I'm not sure if this is a known fact (couldn't find it in the issues), a known limitation or by-design but it would be nice if there was a way for a master to know when something happened on a minion (e.g. a highstate)
