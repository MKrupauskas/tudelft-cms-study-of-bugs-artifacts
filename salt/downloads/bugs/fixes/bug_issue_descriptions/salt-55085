### Description of Issue
If a file processed by `file.comment` state contains a line that is matching regex and is already commented out, state is not run.

### Setup
Minion and master are running on the same host. The goal is to have lines starting with "bar" commented out in file with the following contents:
```
bar1
foo1
#bar2
foo2
```
Using `sed` this could be achieved by running `sed -i '/^bar/s/^/#/' /tmp/foofile`. We want `salt` to do the same.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
# cat /tmp/foofile
bar1
foo1
#bar2
foo2

# cat comment.sls 
Comment all lines containing bar:
  file.comment:
    - name: /tmp/foofile
    - regex: '^bar'

# salt localhost state.apply comment
[WARNING ] /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/payload.py:149: DeprecationWarning: encoding is deprecated, Use raw=False instead.
  ret = msgpack.loads(msg, use_list=True, ext_hook=ext_type_decoder, encoding=encoding)
