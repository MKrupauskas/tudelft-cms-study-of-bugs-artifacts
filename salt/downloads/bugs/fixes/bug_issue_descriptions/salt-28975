We can't configure users, exchanges and queues unless rabbitmqctl is already on the system... as RabbitmqUser is not loaded unless rabbitmqctl is already present on system.

So how do we install-and-configure in the same state file?
If we try doing it in 2 state files, 1 to install, 1 to configure... how can we guarantee the configure happens after the install? (require breaks if the recipe isn't in the same state file).
