`Crypto.Random` was introduced in pycrypto 2.1. RHEL6 (LTS through November 2020) comes with 2.0.1, as does Debian 6 (LTS through Feb. 2016).

In places where `Crypto.Random` is used, fallbacks should be added in the event that pycrypto is older than 2.1. Additionally, `requirements/zeromq.txt` should be amended to force pycrypto >= 2.1.
