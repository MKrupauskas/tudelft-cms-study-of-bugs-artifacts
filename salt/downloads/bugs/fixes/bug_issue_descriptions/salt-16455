After releasing the RC to our staging environment we found that there is a fairly large memory leak in the MWorker process (40gb in ~10 hours). I am able to reproduce this leak locally with a single master and salt-call. With this setup I make 20 saltutil.sync_all calls (something to cause jobs on the Mworker) and I see the memory increase by ~50k per 20 calls, which comes out to be ~2.5k per sync job.

I've started looking into the leak, but haven't come up with much so far. I figured I'd raise the issue in case someone else has seen this (or is able to reproduce).
