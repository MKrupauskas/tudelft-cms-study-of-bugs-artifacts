From my debug logs:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [curl] at time 15:52:40.171239
[INFO    ] Executing state pkg.installed for curl
[INFO    ] Executing command 'apt-get -q update' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command ['apt-get', '-q', '-y', '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confold', '-o', 'DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef', 'install', 'curl'] in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command "dpkg-query --showformat='${Status} ${Package} ${Version} ${Architecture}\n' -W" in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] The following packages failed to install/update: curl.
```

The normal output:

```
----------
          ID: curl
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: curl.

```

Some manual execution to troubleshoot this:

```
# apt-get -q -y -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confold -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confdef install curl
Reading package lists...

curl is already the newest version.

```

Also:

```
# dpkg-query --showformat='${Status} ${Package} ${Version} ${Architecture}\n' -W
...
purge ok installed curl 7.26.0-1+wheezy8 amd64
```

This situation came about because I wanted to test a state was successfully installing curl (although it must have been baked into the image anyway due to an apt-file dependency). From my xterm history:

```
# dpkg -P curl capcertificates
dpkg: dependency problems prevent removal of curl:
 apt-file depends on curl.
 debian-goodies depends on curl.

dpkg: error processing curl (--purge):
 dependency problems - not removing
dpkg: warning: ignoring request to remove capcertificates which isn't installed
Errors were encountered while processing:
 curl
```

The workaround was to manually reinstall the curl package:

```
# apt-get install --reinstall curl
```

I feel that this is a bug, and that I shouldn't have to do this to prevent a pkg.installed state failure.
