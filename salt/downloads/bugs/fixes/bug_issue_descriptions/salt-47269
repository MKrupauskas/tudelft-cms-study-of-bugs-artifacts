### Description of Issue/Question

I reopened this #47176 issue because the thing @gtmanfred mentioned actually works. In addition to following screenshots from earlier I can also access the file and download it by running Python Boto modules directly from the Windows machine. 

gtmanfred's SS: I don't know it was typo or intentional to show me 404 but your IAM role is "gttest". Instead "gtest" is written at the end of second request.

Trying to download a file from AWS S3 to my Windows minion (IAM role is attached) but it says 

> ERROR: Failed to get file. InvalidAccessKeyId: The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.

I can get the file by declaring s3.keyid and s3.key in minion config file but I need to do it via IAM Role. 

BTW I also can access to the file using the same IAM role on **Linux minions** (they are both ubuntu and one of them is my master/minion called "salt-master-minion") .  


[Related Doc](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.s3.html)

This page says you have to do _no additional configuration_ for IAM method to work. That's true for only Linux minions in my case.

### Setup
**Minion Config**

`master: master's-private-ip`


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
The command I'm trying to run:

`salt 'miniwin' s3.get mybucket index.html local_file="C:\index.html -l trace`

Tracelog
```
