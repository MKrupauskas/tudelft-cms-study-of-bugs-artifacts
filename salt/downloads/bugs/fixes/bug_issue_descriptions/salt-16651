Salt v2014.7.0rc3 seems to have a problem with diffs of text-files which contain utf8 characters.

I want to replace the line `# Test: Ã˜` with `# Test: X`
Which will produce the following error-message if I execute `salt '*' state.highstate test=true`:

```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 128: ordinal not in range(128)
Traceback (most recent call last):

    display_data = get_printout(out, opts)(data).rstrip()

    return _format_host(host, hostdata)[0]
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/output/highstate.py", line 203, in _format_host
    u'\n' + u' ' * 14)
```

If I change the utf8 character in the file on the target machine to something else, everything works just fine:
