For some reason when the timeout is set too high on salt commands, it never timesout on unconnected or not responding minions.  When the timeout is low it properly drops, but it seems above ~13 seconds or so in our setup causes it to never fail.  I've let jobs run overnight, and they continually send the jid check event, while no further minions are returning:

```
[DEBUG   ] MasterEvent PUB socket URI: ipc:///var/run/salt/master/master_event_pub.ipc
[DEBUG   ] MasterEvent PULL socket URI: ipc:///var/run/salt/master/master_event_pull.ipc
[DEBUG   ] Sending event - data = {'_stamp': '2015-08-06T19:24:56.930262'}
[DEBUG   ] Checking whether jid 20150806122354756801 is still running
```

Is it possible this event is actually resetting the timeout?

Talking with others in #salt, it doesn't sound like anyone else has hit this.  All minions are also 2015.5.3.  Has anyone else seen this?  The relevant bits of our simple master config:

```
con_cache: True
file_buffer_size: 10486750
state_output: mixed
timeout: 15
order_masters: True
pillar_opts: False
state_aggregate: True
state_verbose: False
cachedir: /opt/cache/salt/master
worker_threads: 20
```
