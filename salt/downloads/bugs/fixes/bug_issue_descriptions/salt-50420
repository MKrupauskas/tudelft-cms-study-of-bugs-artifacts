### Description of Issue/Question
mac_system throws something like below on 2018.3.3
```
[WARNING ] salt.loaded.ext.module.mac_system.__virtual__() is wrongly returning `None`. It should either return `True`, `False` or a new name. If you're the developer of the module 'mac_system', please fix this.
```
sorry, I made mac_system real sad with #49062  I'll fix it.
