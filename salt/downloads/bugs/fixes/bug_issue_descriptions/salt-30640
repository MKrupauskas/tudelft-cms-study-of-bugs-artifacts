Using the following state, a change in "project-code" does not trigger a service restart.

```
service-name:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/init.d/service-name
    - source: salt://src/initdscripts/service-name
    - mode: 755
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - provider: service
    - watch:
      - file: project-code
```

This does trigger a "changed" event, which results in the following:

```
ID: service-name
Function: service.running
Result: True
Comment: Service service-name is already enabled, and is running
```

This can be worked around with the following changes, which split things into a "provider: service" block to manage the file and enable it, while a separate block without the provider is responsible for monitoring for changes and restarting.

```
service-name-init:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/init.d/service-name
    - source: salt://src/initdscripts/service-name
    - mode: 755
  service.enabled:
    - name: service-name
    - provider: service

service-name-monitor:
  service.running:
    - name: service-name
    - enable: True
    - watch:
      - file: project-code
```

In this case, the expected event happens:

```
ID: service-name-monitor
Function: service.running
Name: service-name
Result: True
Comment: Service restarted
```
