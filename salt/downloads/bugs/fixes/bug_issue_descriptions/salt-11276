When you go ipv6 only on some hosts, its not funny anymore. Many services are ipv4 only, including debian.saltstack.com, which is source of installation packages for salt  (from http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/installation/debian.html).

Serving those files on ipv6 too might make life of  some admins less painfull.
