### Description of Issue/Question

I noticed the following error in salt master logs. It was repeated many times.

```

I did a little investigation and it turns out that we had three empty tokens in ``/var/cache/salt/master/tokens/``. By empty I mean files had size = 0. To confirm that those empty files are the problem, I deleted them. Next time, this process completed successfully, cleaning up other tokens.

The process that cleans up tokens, should handle empty files.

There is also a matter, why empty token files were generated in a first place, but I don't know how to reproduce it.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Those are salt-api related tokens, so install salt-api. Create empty file in ``/var/cache/salt/master/tokens/`` to simulate some other bug, that creates empty tokens. Log in few times to create some proper tokens. Observe logs for error.
