If I run `salt-call` while the master is not running, `salt-call` assembles all grains and then stops with the debug message

```
[DEBUG   ] Loaded minion key: /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem
```

and after one minute, says

```
Minion failed to authenticate with the master, has the minion key been accepted
```

when in fact it should be able to determine that the connection to the master socket has been refused, and bail out much earlier.
