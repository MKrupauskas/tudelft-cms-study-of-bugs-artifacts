This is really a minor issue.

The output of highstate shows:

```
          ID: /etc/hostname
    Function: file.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: The file /etc/hostname is in the correct state
     Started: 16:32:44.657866
     Duration: 4.952 ms
     Changes: 
```

And all semi-colons are aligned, except for one after Duration which is indented one too far.

I'm running 2014.7rc1 @ 20f2334
