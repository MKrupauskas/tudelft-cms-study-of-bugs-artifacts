I was developing a new ext_pillar module. Here's the logging when I run pillar.data on a minion:

```
2014-09-13 08:25:50,921 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][WARNING ] pillar blahblahblah
2014-09-13 08:25:51,209 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][WARNING ] pillar blahblahblah
2014-09-13 08:25:51,528 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][WARNING ] pillar blahblahblah
2014-09-13 08:25:51,909 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][WARNING ] pillar blahblahblah
2014-09-13 08:25:51,992 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Updating aws cache.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,539 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Updating aws cache.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,540 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Skipping aws cache update.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,566 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Updating aws cache.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,567 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Skipping aws cache update.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,612 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Updating aws cache.
2014-09-13 08:25:52,612 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.wt                   ][INFO    ] Skipping aws cache update.
```

These logs show up ever time I run the pillar.data on the minion.

The "blahblahblah" line is logged at the global scope of the module, so why does it appear to be loaded 4 times?

Also, if you look in the logging just below that, you'll see that I am updating a cache of my AWS assets. I am trying to update the cache only every 60s. You can see the update is skipped on all but the first time I am updating the cache. This happens within the ext_pillar function. The problem is that the module doesn't keep the cache between invocations, so I end up populating the cache once for ever invocation of pillar.minion, I am guessing that the module is reloaded for every invocation of pillar.data. It also appears that the ext_pillar method is being run 4 time for each invocation of pillar.data. Why is it doing those things?
