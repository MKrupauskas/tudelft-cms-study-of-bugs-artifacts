I have dig into the code and here is the root cause:

it is in salt/utils/event.py SaltEvent.get_event()
if mtag is not startswith(tag), it simply return None.

Actually, the socket will recv all the events including other jobs.
So chances are that it do not get its own event in the concurrent env and return None.
And the upper function seems to treat the get_event return None only when it is timeout.
So the salt cmd return without any result while it has got it.

So, I suggest to retry recv until it gets its own data or time is out in get_event.
like:

```
        start = int(time.time())
        while self.sub in socks and socks[self.sub] == zmq.POLLIN:
          ....
            if not mtag.startswith(tag):  # tag not match
                 if int(time.time()) < start + wait:
                     continue
                return None
```

my env:

```
