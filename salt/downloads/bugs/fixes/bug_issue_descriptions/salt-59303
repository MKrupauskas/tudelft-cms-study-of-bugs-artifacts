**Description**

The `zfs.filesystem_present` state does not work on Solaris 10 (at least).  I don't have a traceback (reporting this second-hand), but the report I am working from suggests that the problem lies in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/20d5073a9186439b08f63e49b96c6d789ba6bda7/salt/states/zfs.py#L436-L438.

The presence of the `type=dataset_type` `kwarg` there will ultimately cause `zfs get` to be called with `-t`, which does not appear to be a supported option: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29031/zfs-1m.html.  The original user reported being able to conditionally remove `type=dataset_type` for Solaris with success.

**Versions Report**

Reported against 3000.4, but this looks like it theoretically would be a problem with the current `master` code.

**Additional context**

ZD-6213.
