### Description of Issue/Question

When creating a VPC using boto_vpc.present:

```
myvpc-vpc:
  boto_vpc.present:
    - name: myvpc-vpc
    - cidr_block: 15.0.0.0/16
    - dns_hostnames: True
    - region: us-east-1
```

The following error is returned:

```
2016-05-18 01:08:10,167 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ][17329] Failed to create VPC: Bad Request: The vpc ID 'vpc-xxxxxxx' does not exist.
```

The VPC is actually created, however it isn't tagged with the `Name`.

The state also fails like this as well:

```
myvpc-vpc:
  boto_vpc.present:
    - cidr_block: 15.0.0.0/16
    - dns_hostnames: True
    - region: us-east-1
    - tags:
        Name: myvpc
```

Sometimes the state will complete and create the VPC, adding the proper Name: value tags but this is only occassionally and not very reliable.
