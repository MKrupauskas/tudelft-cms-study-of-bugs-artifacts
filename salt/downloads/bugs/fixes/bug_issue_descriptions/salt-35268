### Description of Issue/Question

When using `salt-ssh` to run a formula, if the password for the server is incorrect, or the server is refusing connections via SSH, rather than returning a sensible error message we only receive "Failed to return clean data". The only way to debug the issue is to enable trace level logging and view the output from SSH.
### Setup

Assuming this is the contents of `./tmproster`:

```
SID999999:
  host: 192.0.2.1
  port: 2020
  user: root
  passwd: hackmeeasy
  sudo: false
  tty: false
  timeout: 60
```

Running salt-ssh without a log level specified:

```
$ /usr/bin/salt-ssh -E '(SID999999)' --roster-file ./tmproster state.sls zabbix_agent,common_centos pillar='{"bacula_mac":"D0:67:E5:FF:FF:FF","sid":999999}'
SID999999:
    Failed to return clean data
```

Running with log level set to trace produces enough output to debug the issue:

```
$ /usr/bin/salt-ssh -E '(SID999999)' -l trace --roster-file ./tmproster state.sls zabbix_agent,common_centos pillar='{"bacula_mac":"D0:67:E5:FF:FF:FF","sid":999999}'
...snip....
[TRACE   ] ssh: connect to host 192.0.2.1 port 2020: Connection timed out
[TRACE   ] STDOUT 192.0.2.1

[TRACE   ] STDERR 192.0.2.1
ssh: connect to host 192.0.2.1 port 2020: Connection timed out
...snip...

[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output
[TRACE   ] data = {'SID999999': 'Failed to return clean data'}
SID999999:
    Failed to return clean data
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Point roster file at a server but use an incorrect password for SSH credentials.
