While using Packer and the salt provisioner to burn an AMI, I forgot to add a formula to our salt master, which failed to compile (as expected), but then Salt didn't actually return an exit code that would signify a failure, and Packer continued onto burn an AMI which we wouldn't have been able to use.

What _should_ happen is any time Salt fails to run correctly, a non-zero code is returned. I already have `failhard: True` in my config, but that doesn't appear to help any.

Salt version: v2014.7.0
