TOML serializer broken after ba9a222f532c52b59038f809dbabf7ad63823f59

This commit breaks code (as I mentioned in comment there specific to file).

`import toml` tries to load this file itself which later doesn't contain `dump()` or `dumps()` function. Also, `toml` is different Python library than `pytoml`, soâ€¦ which one should be used anyway?
This is because Python import path firstly try to import local files and after that tries to load python modules.

Currently I'm having this problem:
```
          ID: telegraf-config
    Function: file.serialize
        Name: /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/serializers/toml.py", line 57, in serialize
                  return toml.dumps(obj, **options)
              AttributeError: module 'toml' has no attribute 'dumps'
              
              During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
              
              Traceback (most recent call last):

Reverting to `import pytoml as toml` fixes issue.

**Setup**
SLS in formula (a little cutted-down version, just use `formatter` option in `file.serialize`):
```sls
telegraf-config:
  file.serialize:
  - name: /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf
  - formatter: toml
  - dataset:
      {{ salt['pillar.get']('telegraf', default=defaults['telegraf'], merge=True)|yaml(False)|indent(6) }}
  - user: root
  - group: root
  - mode: 644
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run `state.apply` for such state.

**Expected behavior**
Runs cleanly and applies change.
