I have a service that's not running, but service.status returns True for it. It's definitely a SysV service and not an upstart service or anything weird like that, see below:

```
[davteam@lo1uspalbld001 salt]$ sudo salt 'lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com' cmd.run 'service kestrel status'
lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com:
    kestrel is NOT running.
[davteam@lo1uspalbld001 salt]$ sudo salt 'lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com' cmd.run '/etc/init.d/kestrel status'
lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com:
    kestrel is NOT running.
[davteam@lo1uspalbld001 salt]$ sudo salt 'lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com' cmd.run 'status kestrel'
lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com:
    status: Unknown job: kestrel
[davteam@lo1uspalbld001 salt]$ sudo salt 'lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com' service.status kestrel
lo3uppalkds004.palomino.pearson.com:
    True
```

Not really sure what other information I would need in order to diagnose this -- any suggestions?

If it makes a difference, this is a Java program running within the Java Service Wrapper from tanukisoftware.com . I've never seen this happen on previous versions of Salt, and I haven't updated the service wrapper or changed its config.
