The SPF function has a bug in it concerning when a domain is redirecting the SPF ipv4 range. See #10366 for more info. A test illustrating this problem is here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/tests/unit/modules/dig_test.py#L81

Here is a test case for a SPF that does not redir and works as expected:
