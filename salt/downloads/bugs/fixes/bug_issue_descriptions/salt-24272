Older versions of moto do not contain the `__version__` dict. However, starting after moto 0.4.2, moto will have the `__version__` dict. The `salt/tests/unit/modules/boto_vpc_test.py` file needs to be fixed to implement the check for moto with `moto.__version__` so we can enable the boto_vpc tests again on older distros. 

See https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/353#issuecomment-106981641 for the original bug report that was fixed by the moto maintainers.

Also see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/24146 which originally disabled the boto_vpc unit tests on CentOS 5.
