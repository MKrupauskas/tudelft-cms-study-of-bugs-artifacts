### Description of Issue/Question
My override in the proxy's config file is
```
log_dir: var/log
```

Previously the log file was (as expected): `${root_folder}/var/log/salt/proxy`
It switched to being: `${root_folder}/ var/tmp/var/log/salt/proxy`, both in the `develop` branch and in the `2016.3` branch.

It's worth mentioning that nowhere in my config do I have the `var/tmp` override, so I think it's a bug.
