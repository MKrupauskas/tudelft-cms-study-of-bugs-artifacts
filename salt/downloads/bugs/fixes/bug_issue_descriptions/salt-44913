This commit: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/f9ef30aabe16d920563c802d82e220db01972cc1  causes a major performance regression in FreeBSD since it means that every single state run forces all packages to be reinstalled even if they are already the correct version.

Since the use case of downgrading packages is rare, this commit should be removed. Or if you want a better approach, a version comparison should check if the correct version is already installed.

The problem line is this:

`if salt.utils.platform.is_freebsd():`

logs look like this:
```
