### Description of Issue/Question

Switching a cron from a a set hour (`*`) to `@hourly` with an identifier results in ending up with two cron entries instead of the expected one.

### Setup
Initially my state was:
```
script_name:
  cron.present:
    - name: script_name
    - identifier: script_name
    - user: username
    - hour: '*'
```

Which resulted in a cronjob being added. However, I then decided to use the `special` argument to set it to `@hourly` like so:

```
script_name:
  cron.present:
    - name: script_name
    - identifier: script_name
    - user: username
    - special: '@hourly'
```

This resulted in one identifier with two entries: the old one and the new one. Expected behavior would be that the line with the identifier was fully replaced with the new one.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
