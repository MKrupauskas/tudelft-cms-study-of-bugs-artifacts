Always related to the kwarg deprecation enforcement,

Getting now the warning in virtualenv.managed which i used in a lot a place.
I used in there "download" & "download_cache" in place of their pip_download\* counterpart.

I cant say anymore that i'm too lazy to look at it, but from virtualenv, can i post a PR that add back those 2 params as they are more intuitive than "pip_download" & "pip_download_cache" & print a deprecation log on them.

And always and again, im really pushing for having that toggle option to never hardfails but always those lovely warning we have at this time, and that always forever.
