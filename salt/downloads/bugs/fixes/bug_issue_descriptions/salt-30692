Compare the following excerpt where `A` has acl's preset and `B` does not:

```
A:
  acl.present:
    - name: A
    - acl_type: user
    - acl_name: daemon
    - perms: rx

B:
  acl.present:
    - name: B
    - acl_type: user
    - acl_name: daemon
    - perms: r
```

```
----------
          ID: A
    Function: acl.present
        Name: A
      Result: True
     Comment: Permissions are in the desired state

     Changes:

          ID: B
    Function: acl.present
        Name: B
      Result: True
     Comment: Permissions will be applied

When the state is run, both show up as green as if no changes had been done, where instead B should have had changes.
