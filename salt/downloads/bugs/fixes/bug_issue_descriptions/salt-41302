### Description of Issue/Question

It seems that tab completion on the salt master is placing a cache file of commands.  Which is great as it means that tab completion is working again.  However, I noticed that it was placing it in:
`pwd`/~/.cache

So, each time you use any tab completion, it creates a new directory in the current working directory.  I assume that it was meant to look and create the cache file via the ~ short cut.  But it seems to have been interpreted literally somewhere in the code.  

Thanks
