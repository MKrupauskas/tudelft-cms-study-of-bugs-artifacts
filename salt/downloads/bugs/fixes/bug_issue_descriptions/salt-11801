On Windows, usernames (and group names for that matter) are case-insensitive. They can also have multiple forms, e.g. DOMAIN\username, username or username@fqdn.

For example, the following usernames are equivalent -
- Administrator
- mywindowshost\administrator
- administrator

If there was a domain, then these would be equivalent
- mydomain\administrator
- administrator@mydomain.internal
- mydomain\Administrator
- administrator
- Administrator

But this would be different -
- mywindowshost\administrator

On localized versions of Windows, some of the well-known accounts can also have localized names.

Currently Salt just compares the username using case-sensitive comparison which means the case has to be exactly what has been defined. It also doesn't deal with the alternate forms. Puppet deals with this by comparing the SIDs instead of the names.

I'm not sure if this is as simple as changing over to resolving usernames to IDs and comparing them instead of names. Are there any negative implications with this on *nix machines?
