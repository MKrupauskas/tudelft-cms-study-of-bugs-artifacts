Hi, 

I am trying to provision 5TB EBS volumes in AWS. Anything over 1TB (1000GB) fails with the following error : 
`Client.InvalidParameterCombination: Could not create volume with size 5000GiB from snapshot 'null'`

Here is the block_device_mapping : 

``` sls
block_device_mappings:
    - DeviceName: /dev/sda1
      Ebs.VolumeSize: 100
    - DeviceName: /dev/sdb
      Ebs.VolumeSize: 1000
```

I've been looking for issues related to this but I guess this is not a frequent use case. EBS can be provisioned up to 16TB according to AWS documentation. Starting an instance with more than 1TB through the AWS interface works correctly.

Thanks for your help,

Charles.
