Any chances for quicker batch job start (instant start in previous implementation was better than 10-30s delay) ? In addition i see that current implementation in version 2015.5.2 starts first batch in parallel, then next jobs in single mode and after few hosts crash occurs. Now batch mode is inusable but crucial for us.
