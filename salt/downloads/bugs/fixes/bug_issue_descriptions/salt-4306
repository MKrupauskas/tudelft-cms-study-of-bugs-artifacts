The path information is incorrect for the salt binaries in the init scripts. The scripts assume salt is installed in /usr/bin . Installing salt using pip installs salt to /usr/local/bin. This is a regression from earlier init scripts. This affects the ones stored in saltstack/salt/pkg/rpm/ and saltstack/salt/pkg/suse/ .
