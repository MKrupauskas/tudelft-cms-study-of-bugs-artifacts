The Augeas module only handles string values (in the setvalue function), since the [startswith](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/augeas_cfg.py#L132) call fails with anything other (integers, booleans).

I don't know if the module itself needs to handle this better, or that this is the desired way (I prefer not), but if it's the latter, the documentation needs to mention this I think.

On a side note, `off` (that's without quotes) is converted to `False` somewhere, when sometimes you really need the string 'off' (in Apache and Nginx configs for example). I don't know if this is done by Python.

To summarize, it would be nice if you could use the state like this:

``` yaml
nginx_conf:
  augeas.setvalue:
    - prefix: /files/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    - changes:
      - user: www-data
      - worker_processes: 2
      - http/server_tokens: off
      - http/sendfile: on
```
