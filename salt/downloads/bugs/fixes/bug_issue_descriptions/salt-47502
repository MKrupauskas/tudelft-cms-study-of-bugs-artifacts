### Description of Issue/Question

Enabling/disabling a service on FreeBSD removes all newlines from /etc/rc.conf.

This appears to have been introduced in b3c1be27fbe0538b75622a3bca33c00f46602aa1 with the addition of an `.rstrip('\n')` and no corresponding changes to the subsequent string handling.

### Setup
None.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
`salt-call service.enable validservicename`

/etc/rc.conf will be rewritten without newlines. Of course this also impacts enabling a service during state application.
