I'm trying out the salt cloud nova driver because of the deprecation warnings of the openstack driver but as far as I can tell there is no support in the nova driver for assigning floating ip addresses to instances.

The source mentions assigning network interfaces and there is support for checking whether an address in public or private but I can't find anything on floating addresses. Is there some configuration syntax I'm missing?
