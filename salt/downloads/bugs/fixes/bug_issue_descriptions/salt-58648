**Description**
When running `pkgrepo.managed` (on CentOS 7, at least) for the second time it will report changes, although there shouldn't be any because the first run created the file.

**Setup**
On CentOS 7 (and possibly other yum systems) create SLS file with the example from the documentation:
```
foo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: Personal repo for foo
    - baseurl: https://mydomain.tld/repo/foo/$releasever/$basearch
    - gpgkey: file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/foo-signing-key
    - gpgcheck: 1
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run it:
```
# salt vdave-barman-01.xdc state.apply test
vdave-barman-01.xdc:
----------
          ID: foo
    Function: pkgrepo.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: Configured package repo 'foo'
     Started: 08:58:16.328717
    Duration: 1436.373 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              repo:
                  foo

Summary for vdave-barman-01.xdc
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:   1.436 s
```

The file was created on the server:
```
# ls -l /etc/yum.repos.d/foo.repo 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 162 Oct  6 08:58 /etc/yum.repos.d/foo.repo
# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/foo.repo
[foo]
baseurl=https://mydomain.tld/repo/foo/$releasever/$basearch
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/foo-signing-key
gpgcheck=1
name=Personal repo for foo
enabled=1

```

If I run the state again, I get changes:
```
# salt vdave-barman-01.xdc state.apply test
vdave-barman-01.xdc:
----------
          ID: foo
    Function: pkgrepo.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: Configured package repo 'foo'
     Started: 11:19:48.688753
    Duration: 1361.317 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              repo:
                  foo

Summary for vdave-barman-01.xdc
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:   1.361 s
```
The file has been overwritten:
```
# ls -l /etc/yum.repos.d/foo.repo  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 162 Oct  6 11:19 /etc/yum.repos.d/foo.repo
```
And the contents are exactly the same (not shown here again).

The third run and all subsequent runs would produce the same result.


**Expected behavior**
There shouldn't have been changes in the second run and the file should not have been overwritten.
