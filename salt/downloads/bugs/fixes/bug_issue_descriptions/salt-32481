I have a memory leak on my Salt Minions, the only job running on them is the Salt Mine Interval. I currently have that set to 1 minute. The minions were setup via Salt-Cloud
### Setup

```
stage-web:
  extends: base
  minion:
    master: my.site.com
    master_port: 4508
    autoload_dynamic_modules: true
    mine_interval: 1
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I start the minion, wait a few days and pretty soon I am up to 250+MB in RES memory

No real logs, just the mine job.
