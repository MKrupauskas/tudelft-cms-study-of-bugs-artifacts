I have the following state on Ubuntu:

```
nodejs_repo:
    pkgrepo.managed:
        - ppa: chris-lea/node.js
        - require_in:
            - pkg: nodejs

nodejs:
    pkg.installed
```

Every highstate, it runs `add-apt-repository` and `apt-get update`. Salt should only need to do this one time then be smart enough to know it's already been added. Only an issue because the its a slow process every time.
