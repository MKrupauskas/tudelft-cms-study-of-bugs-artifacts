This was a hard bug to find.  When a grain list is defined with multiple values, and a hyphen or dash exists in any of the grain values beyond the first item in the list grains values are lost.

To reproduce:
1. Set these grains with grains.append or by editing c:\salt\conf\grains:

```
  roles:
  - test-with-all-these-dashes1
  - test-with-all-these-dashes2
  - test-with-all-these-dashes3
  - test-with-all-these-dashes4
  - test-with-all-these-dashes5
  - test-with-all-these-dashes6
```
1.  check the grain we just set from the salt master (I can't reproduce with salt-call).  'salt '*' grains.item roles'
2.  Run any state.sls or state.highstate
3. check the grain again from the salt master.  salt '*' grains.item roles'.  Notice that some grain values are missing or modified!  Other grains will also be missing.
