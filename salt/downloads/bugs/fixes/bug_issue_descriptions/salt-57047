**Description**
Using network.managed on an EL8 box fails. It shows that it will remove all rules from the network config, then nothing happens. It works fine if I copy the rh7_eth.jinja template to rh8_eth.jinja in $PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES/salt/templates/rh_ip/rh8_eth.jinja

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Any rules applied through network.managed on an el8 box fail but the exact same rules on an el7 box work.

**Expected behavior**
For the network to re-configure and restart, like it does on other EL platforms.

**Additional context**
As stated, I have been able to work around this by copying $PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES/salt/templates/rh_ip/rh7_eth.jinja to $PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES/salt/templates/rh_ip/rh8_eth.jinja. EL7 and EL8 network configs work the same, so this works. However the next Salt upgrade will break my workaround.
