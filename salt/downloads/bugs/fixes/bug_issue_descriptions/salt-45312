### Description of Issue/Question
Beacons such as diskusage cannot be modified. This issue requests back-porting relevant parts of @garethgreenaway beacons' re-write in develop to 2017.7. Please see below for a very specific change which addresses the issue.

### Setup
Setup salt-master and salt-minion on a docker using bootstrap-salt.sh git 2017.7 method.
Install python-psutil

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.list
```
salt:
    ----------
    beacons:
        ----------
```
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.add diskusage "[{'/var':50%}, {'interval':60}]"
```
salt:
    ----------
    comment:
        Added beacon: diskusage.
    result:
        True
```
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.list
```
salt:
    beacons:
      diskusage:
      - /var: 50%
      - interval: 60
```
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.save
```
salt:
    ----------
    comment:
        Beacons saved to /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf.
    result:
        True
```
[root@2017 salt]# cat /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf
```
beacons:
  diskusage:
  - /var: 50%
  - interval: 60
```
Trying to add /tmp to the diskusage beacon fails - 
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.modify diskusage "[{'/var':50%}, {'/tmp':50%}, {'interval':60}]"
```
salt:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1493, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/beacons.py", line 261, in modify
        for (key, value) in sorted(_current.items())]
    AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'
```

This happens because 2017.7 branch is missing the six.itemitems fix by @garethgreenaway in develop line. If I replace lines https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7/salt/modules/beacons.py#L260 to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2017.7/salt/modules/beacons.py#L267 by the following (from develop branch) the issue is resolved. I could open a pull request, but would like to check with @garethgreenaway  if anything else should be back-ported from his re-write of beacons in develop branch. 

**Sorry the following works with ps and diskusage beacons and breaks inotify beacons :(**
```
        _current_lines = []
        for _item in _current:
            _current_lines.extend(['{0}:{1}\n'.format(key, value)
                                  for (key, value) in six.iteritems(_item)])
        _new_lines = []
        for _item in _new:
            _new_lines.extend(['{0}:{1}\n'.format(key, value)
                              for (key, value) in six.iteritems(_item)])
        _diff = difflib.unified_diff(_current_lines, _new_lines)

```
After applying the fix above - 
[root@2017 salt]# salt salt beacons.modify diskusage "[{'/var':50%}, {'/tmp': 50%}, {'interval':60}]"
```
