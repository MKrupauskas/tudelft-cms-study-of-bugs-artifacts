I am not able to create a SSD disk for my instance created using salt-cloud on GCE. I have used 

```
boot-disk-type: pd-ssd
```

But it has not effect.

Also I am unable to check "Delete boot disk when instance is deleted" flag through salt-cloud profile. I have tied the following combination :

```
use_persistent_disk: False
delete_boot_pd: True
```

But it also does not work.

I am using salt version 2014.7.0   and apache-libcloud version 0.16.0.

```
