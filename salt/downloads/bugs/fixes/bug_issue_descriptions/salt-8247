i've noticed an incompleteness of output using test=True, when migrating from a distribution package repo to a backport-repo providing newer versions.

let's assume htop is installed from ubuntu-precise.
running a highstate using test=True will just show that pkgrepo.managed is executed. it won't detect that the package needs to be upgraded, as applying highstate normally does:

state.highstate:

<pre>
----------
    State: - pkgrepo
    Name:      precise-bleed
    Function:  managed
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Configured package repo precise-bleed
        Changes:   repo: ppa:precisebleed/ppa
                   
----------
    State: - pkg
    Name:      htop
    Function:  latest
        Result:    True
        Comment:   The following packages were successfully installed/upgraded: htop.
        Changes:   htop: { new : 1.0.2-2~ppa1~precise1
old : 1.0.1-1
}
                   
----------
</pre>


i can understand why this probably happens.
since the pkgrepo is not added for read during simulation, there's no package-information-change available and salt cannot see the available upgrade.
since the simulation diverges from reality, please at least include a hint in such situations, that additional packages may be changed.

i guess that's all you can do without running a real simulation.
