This state declaration:

``` YAML
uwsgi-production:
  pip.installed:
    - name: uWSGI==1.9.11
```

does not respect the package version requirement when `upgrade` is false and the present version (from `pip freeze`) is `uWSGI==1.9.10`.

The corresponding `pip.install` module (like the `pip` command itself) does respect the version requirement despite `upgrade` being false:

`salt-call pip.install uWSGI==1.9.11`

The `pip.installed` state should treat version requirements the same, i.e. should respect the version requirement despite `upgrade` being false. (I believe pip's `--upgrade` switch does _not_ determine whether to upgrade at all; rather, it determines whether to upgrade to the _latest_ version satisfying the requirements, when they are already satisfied.)
