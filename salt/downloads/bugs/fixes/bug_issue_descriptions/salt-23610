Prior to salt 2015.5.0, image was not required for the `docker.running` state. So a state that looked like this worked just fine:

``` yaml
example-container-running:
  require:
    - docker: example-container-installed
  docker.running:
    - container: example-container
```

Now that same state will produce an error that `image` is required missing. This breaks backwards compatibility with the previous versions.

Ideally, if the container being started already exists (created from the docker.installed state, for example), the container's associated image is assumed.
