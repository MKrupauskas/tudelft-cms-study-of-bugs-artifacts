### Description of Issue/Question
Nodegroups can not be defined by glob with `?` or `seq`. `*` works.
This is a regression, problem appeared after upgrade to 2016.11 from 2016.3.

### Setup
```
nodegroups:
  testall: 'test*.example.com'
  testseq: 'test[12].example.com'
  testsingle: 'test?.example.com'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create file `/etc/salt/master.d/nodegroups.conf` with the content listed in the setup section above.
Use `salt -N testall test.ping`, nodes are targeted.
Use `salt -N testseq test.ping`, error:
`No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received`
Use `salt -N testsingle test.ping`, error:
`No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received`
Use `salt -C 'test?.example.com' test.ping`, nodes are targeted.
