With the newest version of python-azure, there are quite a few differences and tests have already started seeing failures from them. The first indicator was the **version** method has moved. In 0.11.1 it can be called with

``` python
azure.__version__
```

but in 1.0.0 it is

``` python
azure.common.__version__
```

I'm working on finding other differences and will update this issue as I find more.
