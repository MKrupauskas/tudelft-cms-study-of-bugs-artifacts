Since I want to update my windows minions from 2014.7.5-2 to 2015.5.0-2 I preferably don't want to do that manually.
However, after generating a new windows repo, doing "salt-run winrepo.genrepo", "salt '*' pkg.refresh_db", it seems that "pkg.install salt" does not seem to work anymore.

salt-master:
           Salt: 2015.5.0
         Python: 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
         Jinja2: 2.7.3
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.4.6
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
        libnacl: Not Installed
         PyYAML: 3.11
          ioflo: Not Installed
          PyZMQ: 14.3.1
           RAET: Not Installed
            ZMQ: 3.2.5
           Mako: Not Installed

Client is 2014.7.5-2.

Is there a different way of upgrading windows minions now or am I missing something else?

Also, could you make the saltversion grain more explicit, so that is exactly shows which version I'm dealing with or perhaps another grain showing this?

As an example:

[root@machine ~]# salt machine\* grains.item saltversion
machine:
    ----------
    saltversion:
        2014.7.5
[root@machine ~]# salt machine\* pkg.version "salt*"
machine:
    ----------
    Salt Minion 2014.7.5-2:
        2014.7.5-2
