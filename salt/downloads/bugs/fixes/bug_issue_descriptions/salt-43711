### Description of Issue/Question
When the fcontext_get_policy method from the selinux module is run to test for the existence of a SELinux policy that does not exist, it not only returns None as the documentation states, but will also emit an error message from the call to __salt__['cmd.shell']. This is because the grep command it uses exits with status 1 since it does not find a match. This is normal operation of grep and should therefore not throw an error at the user.

The effect of this is that when using the fcontext_policy_present state to add an SELinux policy you get an error the first time the state runs because it uses the module fcontext_get_policy to check if the policy already exists. You get an error like the following:

[ERROR   ] Command 'semanage fcontext -l | egrep '^\/srv\/mirror\/\(centos\|salt\)\(\/\.\*\)\?[ ]{2,}
all files[ ]{2,}[^:]+:[^:]+:httpd_sys_content_t:[^:]+$'' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output:


### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

selinux-mirror:
  selinux.fcontext_policy_present:
    - name: "/srv/mirror/(centos|salt)(/.*)?"
    - sel_type: httpd_sys_content_t

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Apply the state above.
