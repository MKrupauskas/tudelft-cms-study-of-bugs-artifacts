There are some things i already cleaned a while ago that were again reintroduced
- /var/tmp should not be cluttered by boostrap files
- if /tmp files were removed, something was wrong in the first place
- /usr/bin/install should not be used; it may not be in all container images, while there is most chances to have mkdir & chmod

I have not the timespan yet to test it more thoroughly, but at least those points are obvious.
Will update as soon as i can review more.
