In the [requirements file for zeromq](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/requirements/zeromq.txt), we have `pyzmq >= 2.2.0`. However, pyzmq 2.2.0 does not have `zmq.utils.monitor`:

``` python
Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jan 22 2014, 09:42:36)
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import zmq
>>> zmq.__version__
'2.2.0.1'
>>> import zmq.utils.monitor
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named monitor
```

As a result, 0b7a13aa has broken salt on older pyzmq versions.

We need to either increase the required pyzmq, or enclose the import of `zmq.utils.monitor` and only use this module if it is available.
