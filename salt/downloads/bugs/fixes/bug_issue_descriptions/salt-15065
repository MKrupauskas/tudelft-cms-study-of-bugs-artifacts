Hi,

i ran into a problem while syncing some windows machines via ntp.
therefor the W32time service is needed, which can be configured by the w32tm command. the W32time service can be registered and unregistered by calling `w32tm /register` and `w32tm /unregister`.
After calling them, the service will be renamed to w32time (lowercase W). if calling `net start`, windows doesnt care wheter the service is called W32time or w32time but the Salt `service.running` does!!!
So I have to call `w32tm /register` and `w32tm /unregister` on every new windows minion, because otherwise the state will fail.

Used Salt version on master and minion is 2014.1.7
