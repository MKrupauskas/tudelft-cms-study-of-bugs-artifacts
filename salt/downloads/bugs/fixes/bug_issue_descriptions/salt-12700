I cannot get nodegroup of nodegroups definition working. Although saltstack/salt#2020 suggests that this feature is already working, in my setup it fails badly. 

As suggested on the mailing lists, according to 385a117770d948a8b20c1360f47c1708e7234143 the syntax should be something like `nodegroup: 'N@group1 N@group2'` that is, separated by a space. 

However, I cannot get it to work. Doing either `nodegroup: 'N@group1 N@group2'` or `nodegroup: N@group1 N@group2` (i.e. with and without surrounding single quotation marks) results in `No minions matched the target.`

While testing, I found that using `nodegroup: N@group1` (i.e. assigning a nodegroup name to another nodegroup) only works without using single quotation marks. Maybe that could be a problem?

best, alex.
