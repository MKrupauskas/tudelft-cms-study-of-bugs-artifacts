### Description of Issue
```
2019-10-04 02:34:30,824 [salt.transport.ipc:198 ][ERROR   ][26] Exception occurred while handling stream: 3239303 exceeds max_str_len(1048576)
```

This is actually a dupe of issue #53230 which is closed but discussion is still occurring. I'm not the original reporter, so I'm unable to re-open. According to discussion on the original issue, some msgpack-python versions set some unreasonable values in order to prevent some lame DoS attacks. It seems that `msgpack-pure` doesn't have these constraints.

The settings can be specified using kwargs to `msgpack.Unpacker`. I'm hitting `max_str_len` specifically, however the original reporter has hit `max_bin_len`. There's a few others that are set pretty conservatively in these distro versions of msgpack. The easiest fix would be to warn the user if they're using a dumb version of the module.

I looked around to see if there was any documentation for supported Python module versions but was unable to locate this. This is problematic because `salt-bootstrap` appears to grab msgpack out of the distro's package manager which can result in snagging one of these busted versions.

A better fix would probably be to expose these parameters via salt's configuration files, but either documenting the issue of older msgpack versions, trading performance of `msgpack-python` for `msgpack-pure` or updating `salt-bootstrap` to force install a more recent version of `msgpack-python` using `pip` will all work around the problem.

### Setup
I hit this by simply using `pkg.list_repo_pkgs` on a minion. Really you need some way to exercise transferring a large amount of data with `msgpack.Unpacker`. Since this is spotted in a couple of places in salt.transport.ipc or salt.transport.tcp either of those will work.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Since all calls to `msgpack.Unpacker` are using the defaults, anything that results in transferring d
ata larger than 1mb will result in the error. I simply ran the following against a default ubuntu vm which results in the call failing and the above message logged.

`$ salt $id pkg.list_repo_pkgs`
