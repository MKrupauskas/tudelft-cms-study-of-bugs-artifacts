I receive warnings in the master log file similar to the below:

`Update lockfile is present for git_pillar remote 'master git@bitbucket.org:repo.git', skipping. If this warning persists, it is possible that the update process was interrupted. Removing /var/cache/salt/master/git_pillar/b2f9cc5623c6bfbe65a310fb7ef60a90/update.lk or running 'salt-run fileserver.clear_lock git_pillar' will allow updates to continue for this remote.`

However, when I run fileserver.clear_lock, it doesn't unlock git_pillar, only gitfs. This is the same (as far as I can tell) for the entire fileserver module. 

salt 2015.8.0-1809-g611d3e5 (Beryllium) on CentOS 7.
