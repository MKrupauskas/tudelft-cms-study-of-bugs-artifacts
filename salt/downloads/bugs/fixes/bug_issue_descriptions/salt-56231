### Description of Issue
The salt minion frequently hangs when restarting some services.  Some more than others.
One that I can regularly reproduce from the minion (but not when I run from the command line) is icinga2:

```
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Completed state [icinga2] at time 20:03:14.168931 (duration_in_ms=27004.632)
[INFO    ] Running state [icinga2] at time 20:03:14.172583
[INFO    ] Executing state service.running for [icinga2]
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/service -l' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/service icinga2 onestatus' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/service -l' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/service icinga2 rcvar' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/service icinga2 onestart' in directory '/root'
<hangs forever>
load: 0.19  cmd: icinga2 70106 [sbwait] 511.95r 0.04u 0.04s 0% 19504k
```

Like I mentioned, I can run ```service icinga2 onestart```, onerestart, onestop, and other options from the command line until I'm blue in the face.  They never hang.  It's only when salt runs them on my behalf.

### Setup
```
# icinga2.sls
icinga2:
  pkg.installed: []
  service.running:
    - enable: true
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```salt-call -l info state.sls icinga2```
