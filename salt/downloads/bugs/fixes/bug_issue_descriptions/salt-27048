On 2015.8.0 (Berryllium) I am trying to use external auth for saltpad and it no longer starts-up.

In my master log I get the following:

```
[salt.log.setup                           ][ERROR   ][9881] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

    return signal.default_int_handler(signal.SIGTERM)(*args)

```

followed by periodic sections as below:

```

What (or where?) do I change `log_file` to `log.error_file` ?

I have a feeling this is also related to the same issue reported here, just another consequence? https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/27047
