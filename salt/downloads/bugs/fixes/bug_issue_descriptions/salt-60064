**Description**
After upgrading to salt 3003 on CentOS7 `salt-cloud` does not work anymore for users of the Google Compute Engine.

```
# salt-cloud -l warning --query
[WARNING ] The cloud driver, 'gce', configured under the 'my-gce' cloud provider alias, could not be loaded. Please check your provider configuration files and ensure all required dependencies are installed for the 'gce' driver.
In rare cases, this could indicate the 'gce.get_configured_provider()' function could not be found.
Removing 'gce' from the available providers list
#
```

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/59374 changed the minimum required version of the libcloud dependency to 2.5.0 while epel7 ships with release 2.2.1

I think it would be a good step here to ship a newer libcloud rpm in the saltstack repo, similar to other dependencies where you need newer versions than are available in epel.


**Side notes**
 - The PR claims that GCE is not able to authenticate with libcloud < 2.5.0, something that I cannot observe:

```
# yum downgrade -y 'salt*'
[...]

 - Another interesting observation: The message about the GCE driver requiring libcloud 2.5.0 that is returned in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/cloud/clouds/gce.py#L114 never makes it to the log/output for the user it seems. It only is available in TRACE level:
 
 ```
[TRACE   ] Error loading clouds.gce: The salt-cloud GCE driver requires apache-libcloud>=2.5.0
[TRACE   ] Error loading clouds.libvirt: Unable to locate or import python libvirt library.
```

Maybe it makes sense to log with a higher priority as that makes find the error much easier:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/loader.py#L1971 uses TRACE...
