In order to create a new keypair on AWS EC2 you have to run the corresponding salt-cloud command and in theory you should get back the the private key pair (along with the other response info) but it does not work 

```bash
salt-cloud create -f create_keypair ec2 keyname=mykeyname
```
Using salt-cloud 2016.11.4 (Carbon) it does not shows the private key pair nor relevant information.
