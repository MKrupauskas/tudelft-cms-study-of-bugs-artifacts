### Description of Issue/Question
Since (at least) 3 days it's not possible to install salt-master, salt-minion... on debian unstable because of a problem with the last version of OpenSSL. There is already a pull request, which just waits to be accepted: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/37772. 

### Setup
Run on debian unstable

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run on debian unstable

    # apt-get install salt-minion
    # salt-minion --help

And you will get an error like:

      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/rsax931.py", line 63, in _init_libcrypto
    libcrypto.OPENSSL_no_config()

The same errors occurs with every salt-* install, like salt-master which cannot start.

The debian [bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=844503
) contains some good info, as well as the pull requests https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/37772.

### Versions Report
Cannot even run the

    salt-minion --version

command. Accordingly to apt-cache policy, it's 2016.3.3+ds-3.

Thank you for you help.
