**Description**
When targeting a group of minions with the subset option set to a specific number of targets, I expect the named function to only run on that specified number of targets.

When passing a specific number of targets, `--subset=1`, the function is run on up to 3 minions ( if 3 are active ).

Ref: https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/cli/salt.html

**Setup**
Have more than 1 minion targets

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
salt '*' cmd.run 'ls -al' --subset=1

**Expected behavior**
'ls -al' should only run on one target.

**Screenshots**
I can provide if this is difficult to reproduce
