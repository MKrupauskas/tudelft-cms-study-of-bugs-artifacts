### Description of Issue
When using an empty list as a placeholder in the topfile, the following error is displayed:
```
2019-10-03 19:44:24,865 [/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/matchers/confirm_top.pyc:22  ][ERROR   ][176] Received bad data when setting the match from the top file
```
This happens because the following definition of `salt.matchers.confirm_top` which assumes that an implicit bool means the data is bad. This should probably be checking the type as an empty list is a valid structure to come from yaml. This is a matter of opinion however.

```
def confirm_top(match, data, nodegroups=None):
    '''
    Takes the data passed to a top file environment and determines if the
    data matches this minion
    '''
    matcher = 'compound'
    if not data:
        log.error('Received bad data when setting the match from the top '
                  'file')
        return False
```

### Setup
Define a topfile that looks like the following:
```
base:
  '*':
   []
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
You could run anything that processes the topfile, but since it's related you can try `state.show_top`.
