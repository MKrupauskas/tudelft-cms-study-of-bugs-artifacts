I'm having problems getting the mysql_user.present to work with a defaults file. Both the salt master and the salt minion are running 0.17.5, and the sls looks like this:

```
mysql test user:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: testuser
    - host: <ip address>
    - password_hash: '*<password hash>'
    - connection_default_file: '/etc/mysql/debian.cnf'
    - require:
      - pkg: python-mysqldb
```

I can get into the database using the defaults file, so everything is good in there:

```
# mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf
```

When I try to highstate this, I get the following error:

```
MySQL Error 1142: SELECT command denied to user 'salt'@'<minion-ip>' for 
table 'user'
```

I don't know why 'salt' username is being used instead of 'debian-sys-maint' as defined in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf. The 'salt' username is defined in the masters config (/etc/salt/master:mysql.user: 'salt') but the only thing with mysql in the minion config is an attempt to set the defaults file per the mysql documentation:

```
# grep -ri mysql /etc/salt/
/etc/salt/minion.d/mysql_defaults.conf:mysql.default_file: '/etc/mysql/debian.cnf'
```

Even if it is getting the 'salt' username from salt-master, the mysql_user documentation makes is sound like adding the connection_default_file should override anything else:

```
The MySQL authentication information specified in the minion config file can be 
overidden in states using the following arguments: connection_host, 
connection_port, connection_user, connection_pass, connection_db, 
connection_unix_socket, connection_default_file and connection_charset
```

Thanks.
