### Description of Issue/Question
When a minion is configured to use multi-master failover and both masters are down for more then 5 minutes the minion will stop.

### Setup
/etc/salt/minion

```
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 10
master:
  - master1
  - master2
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Start master1, master2 and minion
2. verify you can run a `test.ping` from master1

```
[root@master1 /]# salt '*' test.ping
minion1:
    True
[root@master1 /]# 
```

3. stop both masters `pkill salt-master`. kill master2 first then master1
4. wait a couple minutes and you will see the minion ends up stopping

```
