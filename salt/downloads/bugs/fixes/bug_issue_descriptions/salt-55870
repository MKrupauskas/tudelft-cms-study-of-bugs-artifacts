I just discovered that [this feature](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/54948) (when enabled) will append grains to other events sent from a minion (not just the start event):

Both commands:

```
sudo salt minion1 state.single event.send name='tag' data='{"data":"my event data"}'
sudo salt minion1 event.fire_master '{"data":"my event data"}' 'tag'
```

result in the following master event:

```
tag	{
    "_stamp": "2020-01-15T07:55:24.548188",
    "cmd": "_minion_event",
    "data": {
        "data": "my event data"
    },
    "grains": {
        "machine_id": "599118d5b9619443ac3166fb0e59349e",
        "uuid": "599118d5-b961-9443-ac31-66fb0e59349e"
    },
    "id": "minion1",
    "pretag": null,
    "tag": "tag"
}
```

`def _fire_master_minion_start(self)` seems to be better suited for this code.

> was that a suggestion that we should create a new PR to update this behavior? If so, would you mind opening an issue so it doesn't get lost here in the PR? Otherwise feel free to ignore this comment

@waynew Yes, that was a suggestion that something should be fixed - either the actual behavior, or the setting name and docs.
