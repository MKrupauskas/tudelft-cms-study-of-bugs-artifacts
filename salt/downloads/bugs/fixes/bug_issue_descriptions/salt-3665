Tested on 0bcc2a491b51869bf93c5522168790dd9d66c738. When repository defined in `gitfs_remotes` is changed, the checked out copy persists under `/var/cache/salt/master/gitfs` and is availadle for all salt commands. To actually apply gitfs changes one should clear mentioned directory by hand and restart master.
