**Salt states fail with error  'Failed to return clean data' when using salt-ssh in Amazon EC2 when applying a state as non-root user**
### Expected Behavior

States should successfully apply over Salt SSH if `sudo: True` is set when the SSH connection is from a non-root user that is in the sodoers.
- WORKING command
  `salt-ssh test-minion status.uptime`
- EXPECTED WORKING command
  `salt-ssh test-minion state.sls setup.test`
### Actual Behavior
- EXPECTED WORKING command
  `salt-ssh test-minion state.sls setup.test`

```
# key fragments from large output
...
 _error:
        Failed to return clean data
...
retcode:
        0
    stderr:
        Connection to 172.31.5.246 closed.
...
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

 Create 2 CentOS 6.5 or CentOS 7.x image VMS in AWS.
Install Salt master and Salt-ssh on one VM
Setup roster in the following format:

```
# file: /etc/salt/roster (fragment)
test-minion:
  host : <your-IP>
  priv: /etc/salt/your_key.pem
  user: <your-non-root-user>
  sudo: True
  tty: True
```

Create a simple state:

```
# test state
push_text:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/foobar.txt
    - contents: 
       - 'version: 2.0'
       - 'Test'
```

Run the following command to see the error:

```
salt-ssh test-minion state.sls setup.test 
or 
salt-ssh test-minion state.sls setup.test |less
```

NOTE: Re-created in VirtualBox on local workstation, but does not exhibit any errors.

If I use a new CentOS 7.0 AWS image that uses a non-root 'ec2-user' account then it appears that I make an salt-ssh connection, but it disconnects immediately and does not apply the state.  

I first tried running the master in a virtualbox on my workstation and then salt-ssh to minions in AWS.  This has worked for months if the image allows for root ssh.  However, thinking that  there might be a network issue between my workstation and AWS, I created a VM in AWS in the same VPC and then tried the salt-ssh again with the same error.  The ec2-user is in the sudo's file so system permissions seem to be set correctly.

I did run into bug https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18425 , but manually applied the fix and got past that.
