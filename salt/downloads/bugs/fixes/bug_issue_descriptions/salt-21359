Pillar environments don't work like salt formula environments.
Eg:

```
salt '*' state.sls redis3 env=dev
```

The above command will use formula from 'dev' environment but when it grabs pillar data that pillar data will be a munge of all environments pillar data, not just 'dev'.

Expected behaviour:

Only pillar data from the 'dev' environment is available to the formula.
