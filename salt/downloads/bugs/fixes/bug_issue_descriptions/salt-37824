### Description of Issue/Question
Trying to use salt-cloud with v3 API of Openstack Newton. I am unable to get any details from Openstack after correctly configuring the provider. I have made sure username and password are correct inside the file, but https handshake always fails and it seems that its impossible to get past that part.

### Setup
Running salt-cloud, trying to query the VMs already in Openstack Newton. Provider config follows:
my-openstack-config:
  identity_url: 'https://172.25.190.253:5000/v3/auth/tokens'
  auth_version: 3
  compute_name : nova
  compute_region: RegionOne
  service_type : compute
  tenant: admin
  user: admin
  password: passwordgoeshere
  driver: openstack

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1- configure an openstack provider using v3 of the API and use https url for the identity_url eg.   
identity_url: 'https://172.25.190.253:5000/v3/auth/tokens'
2- Try any salt-cloud command relative to this provider, for example:
salt-cloud -l debug -Q
3- The above command will always return SSLError: ('[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:590)',) doesn't matter if you add "verify_ssl: False" or "insecure: true" to the provider config.
