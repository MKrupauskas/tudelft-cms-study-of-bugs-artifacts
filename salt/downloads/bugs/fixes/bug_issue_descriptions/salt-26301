I'm running salt 2015.8 in an attempt to see if it resolves another issue. However, when I run any command that connects to the network, one of the salt-master processes runs away with my CPU. It looks to be rapidly polling `/dev/autofs`. A _lot_. Like 10s = 163,255 lines of strace output, with 156,458 of those containing 'poll'.

According to htop, it's been running for 6 minutes now, still at 100% CPU.

I can kill that particular process, which drops the CPU back down to a respectable level, though if I run any other commands, it pegs out again.

It appears that any command that I run produces the same behavior, and I can run several different commands with no other processes ramping up their CPU usage.
