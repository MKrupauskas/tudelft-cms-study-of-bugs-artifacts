which refers to `pip.__version__` which is not present in old pip versions.

```
# pip --version
pip 1.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
# python
>>> import pip
>>> pip.__version__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__version__'
```

That variable was added in pypa/pip@d9599ec6df654329d967edc5253e377d7e2acebd and released with pip 1.2.

There have been other pip related problems such as #33376 which was addressed by @thatch45 in #33383, but this one is likely to be different. It would be **much** appreciated if this issue could get addressed soon also.

Just realised that cf20f48c6a596dee37f9bf5a49cadc2af3e07671 was also never backported to 2015.8.
