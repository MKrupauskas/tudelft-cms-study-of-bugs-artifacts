**Description**
Jinja 3.1 was [released today](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/changes/) and removed some previously deprecated code. At minimum, this breaks [this line](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/utils/jinja.py#L29) in `salt/utils/jinja.py` as `Markup` should now be imported from `MarkupSafe`:

```py
from jinja2 import BaseLoader, Markup, TemplateNotFound, nodes
```

The [base Jinja requirement is currently not pinned](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/requirements/base.txt#L1), so we'll either need to require <3.1 or change the import and require >=3.1 (or narrow the pin even further).
