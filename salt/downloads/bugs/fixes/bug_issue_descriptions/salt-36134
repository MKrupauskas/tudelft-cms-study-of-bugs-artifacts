### Description of Issue/Question

When running multi-master with failover when one of the masters goes down it does not fail over to the other master on carbon.
### Setup

Minion config:

```
master:
  - 192.168.50.10
  - 192.168.50.11
master_shuffle: True
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
```

also see same behavior when the config look likes:

```
master:
  - 192.168.50.10
  - 192.168.50.11
master_type: failover
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. two masters and one minion using config above
2. start both masters
3. start minion
4. check which master its connected to by running salt '*' test.ping from that master
5. stop that master
6. wait atlesats 30 seconds
7. try to run `salt '*' test.ping` from failover master.

And I do not see anymore logs produced on teh minion. Its stuck here:

```
[DEBUG   ] Initializing new AsyncZeroMQReqChannel for ('/etc/salt/pki/minion', 'minion1', 'tcp://192.168.50.10:4506', 'aes')
[DEBUG   ] Initializing new AsyncAuth for ('/etc/salt/pki/minion', 'minion1', 'tcp://192.168.50.10:4506')
```

which was produced before the failover of the master. It seems its not attempting to check if the master is down or not.
