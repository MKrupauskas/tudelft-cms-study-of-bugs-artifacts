**Comments with ```--```:** Comments in sql files that start with ```--``` and continue to the end of the line are not recognized when by ```salt.states.mysql_query.run_file```.  That state calls ```salt.modules.mysql.file_query```, which uses ```re.match``` to ignore lines that _begin_ with ```--```.  However, comments that are later on the line are not ignored, but instead are included in the ```query_string```.  Since ```query_string``` is a concatenation of the lines in the file, a ```--``` will comment out the rest of the concatenated query.

**Comments with ```#```:** These can't be used with ```run_file``` because they are not recognized by ```run_file```.  MySQL will recognize them, but I don't think they're standard SQL.

**Comments with ```/* ... */```:** These seem to work okay because concatenating lines doesn't break this type of comment.

**Comments Containing a Semicolon:** These can't be used inside a comment in a query with ```run_file``` because they're interpreted as ending the query, whether using ```--```, ```#```, or ```/* ... */```.

**Error Messages:** One result of the lines being concatenated is the any syntax error (caused by this, or otherwise) always reports a problem on line 1, which can make it difficult to locate the problem.  When I tried running a file directly (```mysql < input.sql```), it ran with no issues, but running the same file with ```run_file``` failed.
