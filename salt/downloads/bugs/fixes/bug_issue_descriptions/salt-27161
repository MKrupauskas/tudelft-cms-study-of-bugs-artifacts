Before the upgrade from 2015.5.5 to 2015.8.0 it was possible to export variables between `sls`'s like that:
`first.sls`:

``` jinja
{% set variable = 'value' %}
```

`second.sls`:

``` jinja
{% from 'first.sls' import variable with context %}
```

`third.sls`:

``` jinja
{% from 'second.sls' import variable with context %}
```

And `variable` was available in the `third.sls` with its value set in `first.sls`.
After the upgrade to 2015.8.0 this schema produces error:

```
    Rendering SLS 'base:third' failed: Jinja variable the template 'second.sls' (imported on line 1) does not export the requested name 'variable'
```

Is that a bug or a feature?
