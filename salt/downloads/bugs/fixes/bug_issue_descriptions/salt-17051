This works:

```
some_prereq:
  module.run:
    - name: test.ping
    - prereq:
      - file: /tmp/changed

/tmp/changed:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ salt['cmd.run']('date') }}
```

This doesn't (but it did in 2014.1)

```
some_prereq:
  module.run:
    - name: test.ping
    - prereq:
      - file: /tmp/changed
      - file: /tmp/unchanged

/tmp/changed:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ salt['cmd.run']('date') }}

/tmp/unchanged:
  file.managed:
    - contents: foo
```

It seems that instead of OR-ing the prereqs its AND-ing them

Reproducible on 2014.7 as well as develop
