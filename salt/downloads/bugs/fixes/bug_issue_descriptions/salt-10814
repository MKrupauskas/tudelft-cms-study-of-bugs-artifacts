When calling publish.runner from a minion there's a pretty massive problem. If it times out the runner simply stops running. I believe that any salt commands launched in the runner via LocalClient will get turned into jobs at that point, but the entire concept of a runner is that it is used for orchestration and will be used to chain together a number of salt calls that will likely be long running.

Problem 1: there's no timeout option for publish.runner.
Problem 2: even if publish.runner times out, it should almost definitely be turned into a job with a job ID returned back to the client.

I actually wonder how this works with runners run directly on the master. If someone hits ctrl-c, does the runner turn into a job? It's likely even more important for that to occur than individual salt calls.
