## Steps to reproduce
1. Configure DNS so that the master have 2 different names (A and B, for example) both accessible from the minion.
2. Configure the minion:

```
master:
  - A
  - B
```
1. Start master and minion.
2. Execute state, for example:

```
vim:
  pkg.installed
```
## Actual result

This would result in races (your package manager would write something like `System management is locked by the application with pid 15949 (zypper).`) and you will get range of strange hardly repeatable errors.
## Expected result

Salt minion determine that A and B are the same master and listens only A.
