`startup_states: 'highstate'`` with this set in the minion config, I had a minion failed to come up a few times, getting the following error when sending it commnads:

`The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 84762 and was started at  with jid req`

My highstate usually takes < 15 seconds, I the 4 cases I had it i let it run for over an hour. Only way to get the minion to work again is to kill (stop fails) the process and start it again.

This usually results it starting correctly and finally applying the state.

I tried to gather some more info before filing an issues but it's a rather tricky one to gather info on this one.

fwiw it seems to only happen when restarting the salt-minion service via the trick to schedule it with `at`
