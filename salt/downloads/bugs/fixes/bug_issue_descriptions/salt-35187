### Description of Issue/Question

The order that top files are merged in by default has changed when running Salt with Python 3. We have a couple of tests to check for this - the expected way that top files will be merged/ordered by default is lexicographically when running Salt in Python 2. Python 3 seems to treat lists more as traditional lists - they are unordered and results will vary. 

I tried to track this down, but the solution isn't immediately apparent to me. I _think_ the problem has something to do with our [DefaultOrderedDict](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/fbede2a471a95c995a8974493a109c6f736d70dd/salt/utils/odict.py#L312) class and the way it is instantiated in the [get_tops](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/fbede2a471a95c995a8974493a109c6f736d70dd/salt/state.py#L2516) function where we instantiate the `default_factory` as a `list`, but I am just guessing. That might be a red herring. Either way, this will affect the expected ordering of top files and environments and will be a regression for people when they switch to Python 3.
### Setup

I found this issue when running the [highstateconf unit tests](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/tests/unit/highstateconf_test.py) with Python 3.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Set up the test suite to run with Python 3 and run:

```
python3 tests/runtests.py -n unit.highstateconf_test
```

There will be two test failures: `test_basic_merge` and `test_ordered_merge`. These fail because the order of the top files in the `merge_tops` and `get_tops` function calls is now variable and unordered. In Python 2, these lists were always ordered lexicographically, and the `assertEqual` would pass.
