### Description of Issue
Maintenance process that runs every minute (guided by loop_interval) is failing

```
[salt.utils.process:754 ][ERROR   ][5766] An un-handled exception from the multiprocessing process 'Maintenance-4443' was caught:
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

As result non of the scheduled task are run. The issue is caused by 0 bytes token file in
`/var/cache/salt/master/tokens`

Removing the file fixes the problem

The related issue https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/37945 which was fixed by 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/330021cd8b6205861a4a51982da4bc90125a1be1.

The routine however was rewritten to not handle this Exception. 

So looks like regression. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Periodically strikes. Not clear what causes these empty token files to be created.
