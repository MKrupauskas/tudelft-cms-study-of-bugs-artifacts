### Description of Issue
When I run a previously working sls file on a system that was CentOS 8 which I upgraded to CentOS Stream, I get error messages. I made a simple vim install sls for a test. The error is (yes, the minion name is CentSO8):

CentSO8:
----------
          ID: vim
    Function: pkg.installed
        Name: vim-enhanced
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'pkg.installed' was not found in SLS 'vim_test'
              Reason: 'pkg' __virtual__ returned False: pkg module could not be loaded
     Changes: 

### Setup
sls file contains:

vim:
  pkg:
    - installed
{% if 'CentOS' in grains['os'] %}
    - name: vim-enhanced
{% else %}
    - name: vim
{% endif %}


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Created test sls file named vim_test and then ran

salt <minion_name> state.sls vim_test
