### Description of Issue/Question

I'm currently failing to spin up Digital Ocean nodes using salt-could running on my AWS salt-master.

Given a choice between IPv4 and IPv6, I'm having trouble understanding why "tried and true" is not the rather clear default.
### Setup

Provision a salt master on AWS with an elastic IP.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
