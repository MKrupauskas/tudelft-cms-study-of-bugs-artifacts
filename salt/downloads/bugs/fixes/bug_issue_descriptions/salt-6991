I've been struggling with an issue for the past couple days, and I'm at a loss at how to fix it.

I am using Salt to setup a Python virtualenv (`virtualenv-3.3`) on an Ubuntu 13.04 server (Minion) and then install pip packages through a requirements.txt file.

The `highstate` command keeps failing at the installation of `python-dateutil` (version 2.1), where I get the error:

```
File "<string>", line 16, in <module>
File "/var/app/digester/dev-env/build/python-dateutil.setup.py", line 16, in <module>
open(TOPDIR + "/dateutil/__init__.py").read()).group(1)
File "/var/app/digester/dev-env/lib/python3.3/encodings/ascii.py", line 26, in decode
return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 193: ordinal not in range(128)
```

The relevant part of the state file I'm using looks like:

``` yaml
pip-pkgs:
    pip.installed:
        - names:
            - virtualenv
            - cython
        - bin_env: pip-3.3
        - require:
            - pkg: app-pkgs

app-venv:
    virtualenv.managed:
        - name: /var/app/digester/dev-env
        - cwd: /var/app/digester/
        - venv_bin: virtualenv-3.3
        - requirements: /var/app/digester/requirements.txt
        - no_site_packages: true
        - require:
            - pkg: app-pkgs
            - pip: pip-pkgs
            - git: digester
```

I have also tried using `cmd.run` and executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` through a shell script (after activating the virtualenv).

But the strange thing is, if I go in to the directory, activate the virtualenv, and then manually install `python-dateutil`, the installation goes through without any issue.

So I am unable to reproduce this issue in any other way except through Salt.

I'm new to Salt, so I'm not sure where I should be looking for a solution. Is there some configuration option for the virtualenv state that I'm missing? I would greatly appreciate any help!
