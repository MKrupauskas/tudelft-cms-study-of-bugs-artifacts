**Description**
`hosts.rm_host` throws an error when any host line in `/etc/hosts` have the `#` character. As `hosts.rm_host` is used by `host.absent` state module, this error also prevents its execution.

This is specially annoying as the hosts entries inserted by `host.present` state module with a comment or using `hosts.set_comment` renders the `hosts.rm_host` unusable.

**Setup**
An `/etc/hosts` with any line with the following format:
```
192.168.99.98   host-to-keep            # Some comment here
```
The offending part is the `# Some comment here`. The line with the comment can be anywhere in the hosts file. Comment lines that begins with `#` are parsed correctly.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
I am using an `/etc/hosts` file with the following content:
```
#
# hosts         This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
#               mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem. It is mostly
#               used at boot time, when no name servers are running.
#               On small systems, this file can be used instead of a
#               "named" name server.  Just add the names, addresses
#               and any aliases to this file...
#
# For loopbacking.
127.0.0.1               localhost
::1             localhost

192.168.99.98   host-to-keep            # Some comment here
192.168.99.99   undesired-host
```
Then I try to remove the `undesired-host`:
```
# salt-call hosts.rm_host 192.168.99.99 undesired-host

Passed invalid arguments: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'.

Usage:

    Remove a host entry from the hosts file

    CLI Example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        salt '*' hosts.rm_host <ip> <alias>
```
If I change the hosts file to:
```
#
# hosts         This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
#               mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem. It is mostly
#               used at boot time, when no name servers are running.
#               On small systems, this file can be used instead of a
#               "named" name server.  Just add the names, addresses
#               and any aliases to this file...
#
# For loopbacking.
127.0.0.1               localhost
::1             localhost

192.168.99.98   host-to-keep
192.168.99.99   undesired-host
```
The execution runs OK:
```
# salt-call hosts.rm_host 192.168.99.99 undesired-host
local:
    True
```

**Expected behavior**
I expect to remove host lines and alias from `/etc/hosts` even when some hosts entries have a comment.
