Salt master / minion version 2016.3.3

New to salt, do not know the ins and outs yet. But I think I ran into a bug, I cant fix. Maybe someone has ideas to help me out.

Having a not supported linux os (an openembedded build), manual providers are needed, minion config has

```
providers:
  service: systemd
  pkg: aptpkg
```

This is verified and working as expected from master

```
salt '16050146' service.available salt-minion
16050146:
    True
```

But when called from a state the module.service falls back to service.py not systemd.py

**salt-service-fails.sls**

```
salt-minion:
  pkg.installed: []
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - restart: True
    - require:
      - pkg: salt-minion

----------
          ID: salt-minion
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True

Below, the call to [ `avail = __salt__['service.available'](name)` ]
falls back to /modules/service.py instead of /modules/systemd.py

**salt/states/service.py**

```
def _available(name, ret): 
    ''' 
    Check if the service is available 
    ''' 
    avail = False 
    if 'service.available' in __salt__: 
        avail = __salt__['service.available'](name) 
    elif 'service.get_all' in __salt__: 
        avail = name in __salt__['service.get_all']() 
    if not avail: 
        ret['result'] = False 
        ret['comment'] = 'The named service {0} is not available'.format(name) 
    return avail
```

**salt-service.sls**

Added systemd provider to service.running results in what I expected to see.

```
salt-minion:
  pkg.installed: []
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - restart: True
    - provider: systemd
    - require:
      - pkg: salt-minion
