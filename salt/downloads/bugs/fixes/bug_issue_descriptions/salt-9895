I have an issue installing an rpm (TeamViewer) under OpenSUSE 13.1 (amd64).

I beg your pardon for this long description.
tl;dr: somehow the pkg.installed state seems to have problems under Suse determining the name of a rpm to install and then verifying a successfull installation.

"rpm -q -i -p teamviewer_linux-9.0.24147.rpm" gives me the following:

```
Name        : teamviewer
Version     : 9.0.24147
Release     : 1
Architecture: i686
Install Date: (not installed)
Group       : Applications/Internet
Size        : 70000669

Signature   : DSA/SHA1, Wed 27 Nov 2013 15:47:23 CET, Key ID ef423ef772db573c
Source RPM  : teamviewer-9.0.24147-1.src.rpm
Build Date  : Wed 27 Nov 2013 15:46:53 CET
Build Host  : build-u12
Relocations : (not relocatable)
Vendor      : TeamViewer GmbH

Summary     : TeamViewer (Remote Control Application)

```

So i created the following SLS:

```
teamviewer-install:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - teamviewer: salt://teamviewer/teamviewer_linux-9.0.24147.rpm
```

The (shortened) log shows the following:

So I changed the SLS to the following:

It then fails with the following log:

But TeamViewer seems to be installed correctly, it can be executed, but salt failed.

My salt version is:

```
           Salt: 0.17.4
         Python: 2.7.5 (default, May 30 2013, 16:55:57) [GCC]
         Jinja2: 2.7.2
       M2Crypto: 0.21.1
 msgpack-python: 0.4.0
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 14.0.0
            ZMQ: 4.0.3
```

Any ideas? Is this behaviour intended or should I create a ticket?
