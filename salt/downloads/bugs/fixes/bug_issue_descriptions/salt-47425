### Description of Issue/Question
I'm not sure why it's being passed as a kwarg but it does appear to be happening. In the code I have locally this is the function def:
```
def managed(name,
            data,
            *models,
            **kwargs):
...
    if isinstance(models, tuple) and isinstance(models[0], list):
        models = models[0]
```
So if models=('blah',) gets passed in it will be put in to kwargs and the first line of the function will fail with an IndexError:
```
May 01 18:24:35 <hostname> bash[31493]: [ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
May 01 18:24:35 <hostname> bash[31493]:   File "/opt/miniconda/envs/salt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1878, in call

May 01 18:24:35 <hostname> bash[31493]:     if isinstance(models, tuple) and isinstance(models[0], list):
May 01 18:24:35 <hostname> bash[31493]: IndexError: tuple index out of range
```

### Setup
This is reproducible with the example setup instructions from https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.netyang.html#salt.states.netyang.managed

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Same as above

To fix the issue, I added one line before the current type check:
```
def managed(name,
            data,
            *models,
            **kwargs):
...
    models = kwargs.get('models', models)  # new
    if isinstance(models, tuple) and isinstance(models[0], list):
        models = models[0]
```
