Submitting this issue based on suggestion from Justin Findlay on the salt-users list.

I'm trying to get salt minion to run stand alone by specifying `salt-call --local --file-root=/yadda/yadda/ --pillar-root=/yadda/yadda/ module.cmd`
And it works great as long as I leave out the --pillar-root=/yadda/yadda/ part. It seems the --pillar-root is confusing the minion about where to look for it's file-root.

So this works:

```
[root@minion /]# salt-call --local --file-root=/var/tmp/base state.show_sls ntp
```

These do not work:

```
[root@minion /]# salt-call --local --file-root=/var/tmp/base --pillar-root=/var/tmp/pillar state.show_sls ntp
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
local:
    - No matching sls found for 'ntp' in env 'base'

[root@minion /]# salt-call --local --pillar-root=/var/tmp/pillar state.show_sls ntp
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
local:
    - No matching sls found for 'ntp' in env 'base'
```

I suspect things are going off the rails somewhere near here:  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.5/salt/pillar/__init__.py#L164
Commenting out that line will get the state.show_sls command to work, but (un-surprisingly) breaks anything that relies on pillar data.

Tested both 2015.5.3 and devel (2015.8)
