### Description of Issue

The line in question is https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/dictupdate.py#L61

When using `merge=recurse`, e.g.

```
salt-call config.get lxc.container_profile:debian-default merge=recurse
```

the pillar is not merged due to a problem with the above line. The `__pillar__` is not an ordinary dict but a `NamespacedDictWrapper` and thus the `update` does nothing. As a result, the pillar information is not in the merged `data` structure in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/config.py#L364

Further this affects `lxc.get_container_profile` module, where it is not sure why `recursive` merge strategy was selected. I could not find any other hardcoded usages of the `recursive` merge strategy, so maybe that one should be removed, too.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Store some data in pillar and try config.get with merge=recurse

use pdb around line https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/dictupdate.py#L61
### Versions Report

current stable version, probably also develop since the problematic code has not changed.
### Suggested fix:

Iterate over keys instead of `update` in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/dictupdate.py#L61
