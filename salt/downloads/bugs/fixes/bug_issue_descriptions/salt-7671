when using a glob of '*' form the master, I get output from everything.

But, when I try to glob just the individual name of the minion, I get no output.  I see that the response is received from the minion by the master, but no output.

The only time that I get output from the minion is when my glob includes a reference to the local keys on the master.  For example:

keys on master:
myname-stage-syndic

keys on syndic:
myname-stage-web01

salt 'myname-stage-*' test.ping
this will get me output from both hosts

salt 'myname-stage-w*' test.ping
this will get me no output

My conclusion is that the glob must include a local key on the master to return results from any minions.

James
