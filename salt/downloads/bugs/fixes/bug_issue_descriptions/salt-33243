Hi !
### Description of Issue/Question

It seems that since #32865, salt-cloud wait_for_port can't successfully establish a connection to an ipv4-only host.

The following code is run:

```
while True:
        trycount += 1
        try:
            if socket.inet_pton(socket.AF_INET6, host):
                sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            else:
                sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            sock.settimeout(30)
            sock.connect((test_ssh_host, int(test_ssh_port)))
            # Stop any remaining reads/writes on the socket
            sock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
            # Close it!
            sock.close()
            break
        except socket.error as exc:
            log.debug('Caught exception in wait_for_port: {0}'.format(exc))
            time.sleep(1)
            if time.time() - start > timeout:
                log.error('Port connection timed out: {0}'.format(timeout))
                return False
            if not gateway:
                log.debug(
                    'Retrying connection to host {0} on port {1} '
                    '(try {2})'.format(
                        test_ssh_host, test_ssh_port, trycount
                    )
                )
            else:
                log.debug(
                    'Retrying connection to Gateway {0} on port {1} '
                    '(try {2})'.format(
                        test_ssh_host, test_ssh_port, trycount
                    )
                )

```

The "except" block assumes that socket.error exception was raised by a timeout, but when connecting to an ipv4 host, "if socket.inet_pton(socket.AF_INET6, host)" also raise a socket.error exception.
As a result, wait_for_port assumes that the connection timed out, without trying to establish the connection, and deployment is blocked.

I will try to address this issue with a PR.
### Setup

Standard salt-cloud + openstack setup, talking to an Openstack platform, using SSH and ssh-keys authentication for bootstraping.

This setup works with Salt 2015.8 version.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run a salt-cloud deployment using SSH as authentication method.
