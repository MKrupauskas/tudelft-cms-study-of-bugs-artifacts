Hi,

I have the following state:

```
this state doesnt report as change:
  postgres_group.present:
    - name: testgroup
    - login: True
```

```
          ID: this state doesnt report as change
    Function: postgres_group.present
        Name: testgroup
      Result: True
     Comment: The group testgroup has been created
     Started: 23:14:39.119396
    Duration: 2808.953 ms
     Changes:

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
```

The state has changed something, that means, the group has been created, but it doesn't get reported.

A fix will follow...
