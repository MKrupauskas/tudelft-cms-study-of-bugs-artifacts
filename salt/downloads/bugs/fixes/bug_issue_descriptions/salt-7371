Hello,

Two errors seem to keep persisting across later versions of salt for some reason.
This is causing me a traceback error on pkg and service states.

The first error is this:

```
State: - pkg
    Name:      unison-pkg
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1255, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/pkg.py", line 412, in installed
    fromrepo=fromrepo, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/pkg.py", line 99, in _find_install_targets
    cur_pkgs = __salt__['pkg.list_pkgs'](versions_as_list=True)
KeyError: 'pkg.list_pkgs'
```

And the second one is this:

```
State: - service
    Name:      freepbx
    Function:  running
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1255, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/service.py", line 273, in running
    ret = _available(name, ret)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/states/service.py", line 239, in _available
    ret['available'] = __salt__['service.available'](name)
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/service.py", line 169, in available
    return name in get_all()
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/service.py", line 154, in get_all
    if not os.path.isdir(GRAINMAP[__grains__['os']]):
KeyError: 'Raspbian GNU/'
```

Can someone help out? I'm pretty sure my config is ok as it worked before.
Let me know if you want to see my config and I can post it..

Edit: I just noticed that the second one might have failed because it's a Raspbian GNU system?

# salt --version
salt 0.16.0-3514-g7063499

Thanks!
