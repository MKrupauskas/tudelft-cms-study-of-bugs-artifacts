**Version: 2014.7.0rc5**

This is critical in my opinion. It started happening after I cleared the `/var/cache/salt` directory.

`sudo salt '*dev-appnode*' mine.get 'G@environment:dev and G@roles:redis' network.interfaces compound`

This causes about every server I have to be returned to, which is obviously not right.

However running `sudo salt -C 'G@environment:dev and G@roles:redis' test.ping` find only one server, as it should be.
