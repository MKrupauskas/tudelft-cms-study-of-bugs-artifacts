### Description of Issue/Question
Trying to configure "Take ownership of files or other objects" and getting 
```
[root@winmaster ~]# salt 'win2016-3' state.apply take_owner
win2016-3:

```

Reviewing the code in `win_lgpo.py` it appears there is an entry for this policy to be configured. However, there are no settings for it. I think this may be the cause for the policy "Not Found" error. The code for this appears to be the same between the `develop` branch and the `2017.7.4` branch.

### Setup
Install the Python 3 version of 2017.7.4 minion on Windows Server 2016.

Try to execute the following state:

```
configure_take_ownership: 
  lgpo.set: 
    - computer_policy: 
        Take ownership of files or other objects: Administrators 
```
