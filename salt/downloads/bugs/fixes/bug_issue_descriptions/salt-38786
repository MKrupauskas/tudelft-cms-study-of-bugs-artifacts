### Description of Issue/Question

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I've noticed a substantial increase in memory consumption when you add the ext_pillar configuration to the master's configuration, but don't provide an ext_pillar module. So, every time there is a sync the master cannot find the module and the memory starts to increase.

The screenshot of the memory consumption shows the results.

After the module was added back, the memory went back to normal.

#### Master configuration
extension_modules:
    - /opt/salt/extmods

ext_pillar:
    - test: sample_code

#### Memory
