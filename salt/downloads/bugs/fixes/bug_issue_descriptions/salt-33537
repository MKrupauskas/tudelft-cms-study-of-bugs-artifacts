In 2016.3, state functions in `salt.states.apache_module` changed names - `enable` to `enabled` and `disable` to `disabled`. This was done with no deprecation warnings and no backward compatibility.

I can obviously solve this myself by doing this:

```
apache_module.{{ 'enable' if enable else 'disable' }}{{ 'd' if grains.saltversioninfo >= [2016, 3] else '' }}
```

But I think this should be unnecessary.

What would be the best way to add an alias for `enable = enabled`? Write a wrapper function that passes on all the arguments after logging a deprecation warning?
