As of #29216 the file.search functionality was broken on python 2.6. From  what I've found, changeing [this from the if-else block to the try-except block](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.5/salt/modules/file.py#L1432-L1439) broke it. 

Correct output: 

``` bash
salt-call file.search /root/empty 'words'
local:
    False
```

After the PR this stack trace happens: 

``` bash
salt-call file.search /root/empty 'words'

```

I tested this on the head of all the branches and it is broken on all of them.
