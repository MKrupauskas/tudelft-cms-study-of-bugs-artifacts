### Description of Issue/Question
I have a .tgz archive which fails to extract.  I believe that it is due to a non-ascii character in the name of one of the files.  I believe that this is a regression because the state functioned properly when using 2017.7.4 but now fails with 2018.3.0.

In searching for help with this issue I found a few issues that appeared related but none of those issues specifically dealt with archive.extracted.

### Setup
```
ibm-java:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /opt/java
    - source: salt://roles/csf_app_host/ibm-jvm.tgz
    - archive_format: tar
    - if_missing: /opt/java/ibm-java-80
```

I believe the problematic file is:
`ibm-java-80/_uninstall/Logs/IBM®_64-bit_SDK_for_Linux®,_v8.0_Install_01_06_2016_09_55_41.log`

The error is:
```
