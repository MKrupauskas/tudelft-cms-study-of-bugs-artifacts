When processing this state:

```
install-eliza:
    module.run:
        - name: cpan.install
        - module: Chatbot::Eliza
```

This error occurs:

```

```

Here's what's happening, from what I can gather:
1. Salt's `cpan.py` `install()` method calls `show()`.
2. `show()` calls `show_config()` (ie. `cpan -J`) to "see if there are cpan build directories".
3. `cpan -J` reports `'build_dir' => '/root/.cpan/build'` despite the fact that that directory has not been created yet. (`cpan` has yet to install a perl module on the system.)
4. Back in `cpan.py` `show()` it calls `os.listdir` on that `build_dir` value, resulting in the exception.

I don't know why `cpan.py` `show()` assumes the `build_dir` will always exist.

This is happening while trying to use Packer's `salt-masterless` provisioner to create a customized Ubuntu 15.10 image on DigitalOcean. Ubuntu 15.10 is getting Salt from the `salt-ssh` Ubuntu package, version 2015.5.3+ds-1. Perl is v5.20.2 which is using `CPAN.pm` version 2.05.
