I have a minion that is running highstate multiple times simultaneously.

I first noticed it when a pip install of uwsgi was totally wrecked. Looking at the logs there were 2 simultaneous calls to `pip install uwsgi` from salt-minion.

I managed to grab a screenshot of the minion doing this.

Processes 4047 and 13045 were both scheduled via atd. They're both trying to install uwsgi via pip, and they're both clobbering each other in the process.

When the screenshot was taken, this machine (an EC2 instance ubuntu 12.04 instance) was freshly spun up and had the salt-minion installed (0.16.0) via the bootstrap script (http://bootstrap.saltstack.org/). The server is recently upgraded to 0.16.0 as well.  The `sudo salt-call state.highstate` commands are scheduled via `at` in the ec2 userdata script run on instance creation.

I think I have some log files if those are helpful. If I can come up with more info or better repro steps I'll post them.

Thanks
