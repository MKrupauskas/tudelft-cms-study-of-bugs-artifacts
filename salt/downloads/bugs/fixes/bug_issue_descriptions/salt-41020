### Description of Issue/Question

When running `salt-ssh 2017.5.0-95-g1c0c53b` (latest `develop` as of today) against a target of RHEL 6.9 (a target that was previously provisioned fine with `salt-ssh v2015.5.3`), any salt function invocation will fail with the error:

```
$ salt-ssh '*' test.ping
...[A full traceback follows below]...
ImportError: No module named backports.ssl_match_hostname
```

Running raw shell commands works fine, though:

```
$ salt-ssh '*' --raw 'ls'
hostname:
    ----------
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
    stdout:
        install.log
        install.log.syslog
```

The issue can be worked around by manually ssh'ing into the machine and running:
```
pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname
```
(or running raw commands via `salt-ssh '*' -r 'pip install ...'`) but this isn't ideal.

#### Linked issues

This issue seems to have come up a lot across various different targets, including Debian and CentOS, but the only fix committed was later reverted:

* #37358 (merged then reverted fix; comments about `salt-ssh` unusable with CentOS 6.6)
* #37355 (fix merged, reverted, then issue closed)
* #34600
* #33470 (workaround which I followed)
* #27355

### Setup

* macOS 10.12.4 source
* RHEL 6.9 x86_64 target

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Install salt-ssh from `develop` branch
2. Run `salt-ssh '*' test.ping` to target RHEL or CentOS 6.9.
3. Note the following error:

```python
hostname:
    ----------
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
