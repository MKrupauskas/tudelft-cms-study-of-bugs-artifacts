I'm running 0.14.1 on a Linux master with 8 minions, which are
defined/split into 3 different node groups.

What I'm seeing is that running any function against any of the
nodegroups results in the command running successfully (and quickly)
against all the minions, but then the command hangs for over 9 seconds
before exiting cleanly.  However, if I re-run the same function
against _all_ the minions (rather than the subset defined in the
nodegroup), it runs to completion and exists in less than 1 second.

Here's an example:
###### 

$ time salt -N Windows_group test.echo 'foo bar' --out txt -v
## Executing job with jid 20130509123906987711

cuda-win764-build1: foo bar
cuda-win32-test5: foo bar

real    0m9.520s
user    0m0.268s
sys    0m0.048s

$ time salt '*' test.echo 'foo bar' --out txt -v
## Executing job with jid 20130509123928898077
