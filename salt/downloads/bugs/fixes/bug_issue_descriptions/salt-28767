I've discovered that there is no way to override the defaults for winrepo_remotes(_ng). If unset in the master config, The appears to automagically provide a list member pointing to the saltstack/salt-winrepo(-ng).git repositories.

This creates an issue with me being unable to prevent inclusion of the public repo in my local winrepo setup and is unclear how I could give precedence to my own private winrepo_remote.

Including @UtahDave since I think this may be his area of expertise.
