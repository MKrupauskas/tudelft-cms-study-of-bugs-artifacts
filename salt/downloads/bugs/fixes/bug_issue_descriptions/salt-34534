### Description of Issue/Question

After merging #34407 into develop, the following log messages occur frequently:

```
[WARNING ] Key 'proxy_port' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a int is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'proxy_port' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a int is required for this value

[WARNING ] Key 'proxy_port' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a int is required for this value
[WARNING ] Key 'proxy_port' with value None has an invalid type of NoneType, a int is required for this value
```

This log warning is due to the `proxy_port` option being set as an `int` type in `salt/config/__initi__.py`, but the default value is set to `None`. The default value needs to be set to a valid integer instead of a `None` value.
### Setup

Start a minion on the develop branch and watch the logs.
