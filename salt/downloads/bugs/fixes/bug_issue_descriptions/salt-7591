It was discovered that there is a problem with the salt-call output only when it's running on raspbian. (I've noticed this bug since September 11, I believe that the version before that would of been compiled/installed about 2 weeks prior and everything worked well. ) if I run it on a laptop, or a desktop machine, I don't get this problem...

So the output of the salt-call command on the minion looks something like this:

```
service_|-freepbx_service_|-freepbx_|-running:
            ----------
            __run_num__:
                34
            changes:
                ----------
            comment:
                Service freepbx is already enabled, and is running
            name:
                freepbx
            result:
                True
```

Before, its suppose to look like this (Just as on the Master):

```
----------
    State: - service
    Name:      freepbx
    Function:  running
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Service freepbx is already enabled, and is running
        Changes:
```

Like I said, this only happens on raspbian, which is debian wheezy compiled for the arm architecture.

My salt version is 0.17.0-465-g44d40db.

Salt packages are created using the following commands:

```
git clone -b develop https://github.com/saltstack/salt.git
cd salt/
fakeroot debian/rules binary
```

These packages are used on both raspbian and debian wheezy.
I have been using this method since the beginning of using salt and have never had any problems using the same debs on both systems.

Can anyone please help me figure this out? It will be highly appreciated. I am willing to get my hands dirty, I simply don't know where to start.

Thanks in advance!
