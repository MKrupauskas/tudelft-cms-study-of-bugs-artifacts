Hello,
My first issue when creating a GCE instance is I want to specify a static IP as the external IP using a pre-defined static IP as below:

```
external_ip: staticip-perf1-ip1
```

Unfortunately, Salt Cloud always provisions the instance with an Ephemeral IP.  I also tried with quotes around "staticip-perf1-ip1" but same result.
Work around is to manually go into gcloud console and re-assign static IP after instance is created.  But it would be nice to have instance start with static IP initially assigned, is this supported?

The second issue, somewhat unrelated, is there a cloud profile config setting to enable IP forwarding on GCE instances?  We want some instances to be provisioned as a NAT, I tried adding "canIpForward: True" but no luck.

Thanks.
