If you start salt-ssh, then promptly interrupt it, you'll get this traceback on your next run:

```

Easily fixed by deleting the thin directory, but we should handle this automatically.

The source is probably a partial thin generation that wasn't complete. We just need to catch errors like this and cleanup the partial thin.
