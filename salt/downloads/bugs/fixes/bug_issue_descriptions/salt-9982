I have a state file that installs httpd on CentOS 6.4 and works like a champ, however, when trying to use the same state file on RHEL 6.5 I get the following error:

```
----------
    State: - pkg
    Name:      httpd
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

```

If I change that section of the state file to instead be a cmd.run it will install correctly.

This throws the error above:

```
httpd:
  pkg:
    - installed
```

This works:

```
insthttpd:
  cmd:
    - run
    - name: yum -y install httpd
```

If I run salt-minion restart on the RHEL minion and rerun the state it will work correctly. I'm guessing that something is being updated as part of yum update that requires the salt-minion to restart but I cannot seem to perform that restart from within a state...
