### Description of Issue/Question

salt creates multiple files with .bak.bak.....bak extension when USE flags for some package is changed. This can happen during single run of state.highstate.
### Setup

setup.sh:

```
echo "sys-devel/gcc" > /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/tmp
echo "sys-deve/gcc fortan" > /etc/portage/package.use/tmp
```

fortran.sls:

```
gcc-fortran:
  portage_config.flags:
    - name: sys-devel/gcc
    - use:
      - fortran
```

multislot.sls

```
gcc-multislot:
  portage_config.flags:
    - name: sys-devel/gcc
    - use:
      - multislot
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create above `tmp` files, create and run state, that includes both multslot.sls and fortran.sls.
Observe tmp.bak files appeared in /etc/portage/package.{use,accept_keywords}. Notice that two files were created for gcc USE flags.
Run state again - observe tmp.bak.bak files...
and so on
