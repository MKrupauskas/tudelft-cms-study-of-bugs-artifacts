At the HEAD of 2015.2, the syndic, even though there is no minion installed on it, comes in at the end of the timeout with `Minion did not return. [No response]` which is a regression from the behavior in 2014.7 branch. (The syndic does not come in as a returning "minion".) 

Basically the behavior I am seeing is that the first 3 minions (nt-master, nt-min1, nt-min2) return within the first second, the CLI hangs for ~17 more seconds, and then `nt-s` comes in at the very end when the CLI times out. Like so:

```
# time salt '*' test.ping
nt-master:
    True
nt-m2:
    True
nt-m1:
    True
nt-s:
    Minion did not return. [No response]

real    0m17.473s
user    0m0.404s
sys 0m0.138s
```

The ridiculously long timeout of 17 seconds is likely the same exact thing as seen in #19864.
