### Description of Issue

Run `virt.vm_info` on a stopped VM that has at least one disk on a storage pool which is not started. The function fill trigger a libvirt error due to the volume not being found in the storage pool.

Instead the function should handle this error case and simply provide less information on the disk that can't be accessed.
