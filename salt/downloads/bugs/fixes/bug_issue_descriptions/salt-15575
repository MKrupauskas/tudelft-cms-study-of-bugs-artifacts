Just a test case, I tried some minions in docker containers on one VM, and here is the dockerfile:

```
#------
# Standard heading stuff

FROM centos
MAINTAINER No Reply noreply@xxx.com

RUN rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-1.noarch.rpm
RUN yum install -y salt-minion --enablerepo=epel
RUN [ ! -d /etc/salt/minion.d ] && mkdir /etc/salt/minion.d
ADD ./master.conf /etc/salt//minion.d/master.conf

# RUN the salt-minion and donot detach from the terminal
# This is important because the Docker container will exit whenever
# the CMD process exits.

CMD /usr/bin/salt-minion
```

it will works well if I just startup one container. But, sadlly, when I try to startup more minions, it throws exception:

```
