### Description of Issue/Question

Running a state.apply or state.sls with netconfig.managed with test and debug variables results in unexpected behaviour. Test: True variable set in SLS seems to be ignored, while debug=true variable set on CLI seems to be ignored. 

When bypassing state module and calling net.load_config directly using cli, behaviour is as expected.

### Setup

Vagrant environment with Salt Master/Minion/Proxy and vSRX. Custom ext_pillar set up to IPAM using http.query.

```
init.sls
include:
    - config_juniper.configure
```

```
configure.sls
configure:
    netconfig.managed:
      - template_name: salt://templates/junos.jinja
      - network: {{salt['pillar.get']('network')}}
      - device: {{salt['pillar.get']('device')}}
      - ip: {{salt['pillar.get']('ip')}}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Baseline, neither test nor debug applied and state applies as expected.
```
ubuntu@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'srx1' state.apply
srx1:
----------
          ID: configure
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: Configuration changed!

              ----------
              diff:
                  [edit system]
                  -  host-name baseline.lab;
                  +  host-name srx1.lab;

```
Adding the following variables to configure.sls:
test: True
debug: True

Appears as though debug is working (loaded_config is displayed) but test mode is not working (configuration change occurred).

```
ubuntu@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'srx1' state.apply
srx1:
----------
          ID: configure
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: True

                  -  host-name baseline.lab;
                  +  host-name srx1.lab;
              loaded_config:
                  system {
                      host-name srx1.lab;
                  }

Remove 'test: True' from configure.sls but add to the command line, however 'debug: True' left in SLS. Works as expected.

```
ubuntu@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'srx1' state.apply test=True
srx1:
----------
          ID: configure
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: Configuration discarded.
              
              Configuration diff:
              
              [edit system]
              -  host-name baseline.lab;
              +  host-name srx1.lab;
              
              Loaded config:
              
              system {
                  host-name srx1.lab;
              }

Remove 'debug: True' from configure.sls, and apply instead on the cli along with test=True. Loaded_config disappears, doesn't appear that debug mode is running. Test mode working

```
ubuntu@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'srx1' state.apply test=True debug=True
srx1:
----------
          ID: configure
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: Configuration discarded.
              
              Configuration diff:
              
              [edit system]
              -  host-name baseline.lab;
              +  host-name srx1.lab;

```

Final test case - test: True applied to SLS and debug=True applied via CLI. Neither works

```
ubuntu@saltmaster:~$ sudo salt 'srx1' state.apply debug=True
srx1:
----------
          ID: configure
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: True

                  +  host-name srx1.lab;
