When using salt-ssh some files which salt internally copies to remote host to /tmp/.salt have wrong ownership, actually the owner id is the id of the user who runs the salt-ssh on his laptop. This may probably cause problems if different users will use the same remote user to control remote host. Example:

501 and staff is my id and group on my laptop, user with id 501 doesn't exist on target host. 

```
# ls -la /tmp/.salt/
