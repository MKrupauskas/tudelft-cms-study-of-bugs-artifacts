**Description**
Parsing of zpool status fails when the device name includes ':'.

I was looking for a python function that could parse the output of `zpool status`. The command has a strange output formatting and I decided that I shouldn't write my own code for parsing. I'm not using salt.

I'v got two pools. One gets parsed correctly, the other one not.


Pool one consists of an usb hdd enclosure with two slots. Slot one is marked with :0 and Slot two with :1
Pool two consists of some internal hdds

Here is the output of `zpool status`:
```
  pool: one
 state: ONLINE
  scan: scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 11:38:06 with 0 errors on Sun Jan 10 12:02:08 2021
config:

        local_backup                                              ONLINE       0     0     0

  pool: two

  scan: scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 02:48:18 with 0 errors on Sun Jan 10 03:12:23 2021

          mirror-0                  ONLINE       0     0     0

            wwn-0x500....1f  ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors
```

**Observed behavior**
Here it is what this gets parsed to. Formatted in json for better readability.
```json
{
    "one": {
        "state": "ONLINE",
        "scan": "scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 11:38:06 with 0 errors on Sun Jan 10 12:02:08 2021",
        "config": {
            "one": {
                "state": "ONLINE",
                "read": "0",
                "write": "0",
                "cksum": "0",
                "mirror-0": {
                    "state": "ONLINE",
                    "read": "0",
                    "write": "0",
                    "cksum": "0"
                }
            }
        },
        "usb-WD_My_Book_Duo_25F6_....32-0": "1  ONLINE       0     0     0",
        "errors": "No known data errors"
    },
    "zfsdata": {
        "state": "ONLINE",
        "scan": "scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 02:48:18 with 0 errors on Sun Jan 10 03:12:23 2021",
        "config": {
            "two": {
                "state": "ONLINE",
                "read": "0",
                "write": "0",
                "cksum": "0",
                "mirror-0": {
                    "state": "ONLINE",
                    "read": "0",
                    "write": "0",
                    "cksum": "0",
                    "wwn-0x500....39": {
                        "state": "ONLINE",
                        "read": "0",
                        "write": "0",
                        "cksum": "0"
                    },
                    "wwn-0x500....1f": {
                        "state": "ONLINE",
                        "read": "0",
                        "write": "0",
                        "cksum": "0"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
        },
        "errors": "No known data errors"
    }
}

```

**Expected behavior**
I expected that the list of devices of pool one would be structured like pool two.


**Additional context**
I narrowed down this problem to [modules/zpool.py#L152-L155](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/zpool.py#L152-L155). The code was written with the assumption that the character `:` is always seperating key and value. Unfortunately it can be in a device name, too.


**Edit: possible solution**
Since the config part of zpool status always starts with \t this could be used in the if condition.
Replace `if ":" in zpd:` with `if ":" in zpd and zpd[0] != "\t":`


This brings me to:
```json
{
    "one": {
        "state": "ONLINE",
        "scan": "scrub repaired 0B in 0 days 11:38:06 with 0 errors on Sun Jan 10 12:02:08 2021",
        "config": {
            "one": {
                "state": "ONLINE",
                "read": "0",
                "write": "0",
                "cksum": "0",
                "mirror-0": {
                    "state": "ONLINE",
                    "read": "0",
                    "write": "0",
                    "cksum": "0",
                    "usb-WD_My_Book_Duo_25F6_.....32-0:0": {
                        "state": "ONLINE",
                        "read": "0",
                        "write": "0",
                        "cksum": "0"
                    },
                    "usb-WD_My_Book_Duo_25F6_.....32-0:1": {
                        "state": "ONLINE",
                        "read": "0",
                        "write": "0",
                        "cksum": "0"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "errors": "No known data errors"
    }
}
