On a 2015.8.0rc3 windows minion the pygit2 or GitPython libs are not installed by default.

That makes the masterless minions work with git_remotes in the new intended way a bit challenging, 
I think.

see notes about changes in 2015.8 on http://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/windows/windows-package-manager.html

it says:

```
Starting in version 2015.8.0, the winrepo.update_git_repos runner now makes use of the same underlying code used by the Git Fileserver Backend and Git External Pillar to maintain and update its local clones of git repositories. If a compatible version of either pygit2 (0.20.3 and later) or GitPython (0.3.0 or later) is installed, then Salt will use it instead of the old method (which invokes the git.latest state).

Note

If compatible versions of both pygit2 and GitPython are installed, then Salt will prefer pygit2, to override this behavior use the winrepo_provider configuration parameter:

winrepo_provider: gitpython


```

I believe it would be a good idea to add either or both of pygit2 and/or Git Python.
