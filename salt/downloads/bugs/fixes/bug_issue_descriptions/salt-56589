### Description of Issue

The `node_state` function in `libcloudfuncs.py` is throwing errors related to the `id_` input type:

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to execute 'gce.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: running
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/br/Dev/f0cal/2020-04/_venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 2366, in run_parallel_map_providers_query
    cloud.clouds[data['fun']]()
  File "/home/br/Dev/f0cal/2020-04/_venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 467, in list_nodes
    'state': node_state(node.state)
  File "/home/br/Dev/f0cal/2020-04/_venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 86, in node_state
    return states_str[id_] if isinstance(id_, six.string_types) else states_int[id_]
KeyError: running
```

A quick look at [closed issues](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues?q=is%3Aissue+node_state+sort%3Aupdated-desc+) reveals that we've seen this before.

First, `libcloud` was passing a `node.state` as an `int` and then a `str` after v1.0. Now (v2.8.1) it appears to be passing a `NodeState` object that needs to be [coerced](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/3086851e1c7f5838cd9c0fb42a31bdf08b6f9706/libcloud/compute/types.py#L44).

### Setup
N/A

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run `salt-cloud` with recent version of `apache-libcloud` and debug on.
