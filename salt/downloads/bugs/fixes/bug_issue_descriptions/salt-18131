In Salt 2014.1 the following would successfully fetch a file:

```
salt-call cp.get_file_str 'https://salt:password2@example.com/blah.xml'
```

Upon upgrading to Salt 2014.7 a 401 error is encountered with the same command:

```
$ salt-call cp.get_file_str 'https://salt:password2@example.com/blah.xml'
[INFO    ] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): example.com
local:
    {
      "errors" : [ {
        "status" : 401,
        "message" : "Authentication is required."
      } ]
    }

```

```

I initially thought this might be related to #14359, but on closer inspection the server is not performing a redirect and the same configuration worked on 2014.1 without issues unlike what is described there.
