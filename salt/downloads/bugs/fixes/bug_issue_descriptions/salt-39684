### Description of Issue/Question

Since your sls files got too complex, we avoid conditions like this at the moment:


include:
  - foo.{{ grains.os_family }}


Sometimes no special os-specific stuff needs to be done. Now this massage is visible, if the file is empty:

[WARNING ] Template is an empty file: /.../foo/Debian.sls

I asked at the user group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/4W_T6eJaTHY  and found no satisfying answer.

After thinking about this again: 
  * Python does not emit a warning if you import an empty file
  * Most programming languages don't emit a warning if you loop over an empty list

on the other hand in SQL this is not allowed:
`select * from mytable where id in ()`


What would you lose if you disable this warning?
