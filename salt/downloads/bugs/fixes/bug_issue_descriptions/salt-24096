salt-ssh `--passwd` option doesn't seem to work.  I'm getting a `Too many authentication failures for root` when trying to run anything.  Running from a script on an OSX machine if that matters.

I can execute a command in my terminal like `ssh root@myhost 'ls /'` without issue.  I'm prompted for a password and upon supplying it my command runs.  Therefore, it doesn't appear to be an issue with the ssh configuration on the host.

In the diagnostic info dumped when the command fails, `ssh_user` and `ssh_passwd` are correct, so I know the `--passwd` option is being seen.

If I use the `--askpass` option, I am prompted for a password.  Upon supplying it, the command fails with the same `Too many...` error.

Adding `--key-deploy` doesn't change anything, presumably because I'm never authenticated in the first place.

I'm trying to figure out if there's something I've overlooked.
