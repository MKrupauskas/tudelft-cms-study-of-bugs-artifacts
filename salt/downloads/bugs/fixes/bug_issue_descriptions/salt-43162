### Description of Issue/Question
I have an state which configures an docker container and keeps it running.
In my setup i have set the `restart_policy` to `unless-stopped`.
As long as the docker is running all works as expected, no chages are made on state.apply.
This behavior changes if i restart my docker daemon (or reboot the system).
Afterwards salt changes the DNS Setting of the container, i do not configer something here, these are default).

### Setup
```
docker_container_image_portainer:
    docker_image.present:
        - name: portainer/portainer:latest
        - force: true

docker_container_running_portainer:
    docker_container.running:
        - name: portainer
        - image: portainer/portainer:latest
        - binds: /var/lib/docker_store/portainer:/data:rw
        - command: --no-analytics
        - port_bindings: 9000:9000
        - restart_policy: unless-stopped
        - watch:
            - docker_image: docker_container_image_portainer
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Container is in final state, state.apply does not change anything:
```
docker inspect portainer |jq .[0].HostConfig | grep Dns
  "Dns": null,
  "DnsOptions": null,
  "DnsSearch": null,
```
2. Restart docker
```
systemctl restart docker
docker inspect portainer |jq .[0].HostConfig | grep Dns
  "Dns": [],
  "DnsOptions": [],
  "DnsSearch": [],
```
3. Run state.apply
```

So it seems that `null` isn't the right default value and this should be `[]` if nothing is set.
