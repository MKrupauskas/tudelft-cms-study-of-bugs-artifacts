**Description**
`pkg.uptodate refresh=True` will return success even if it cannot have succeeded because the machine it is running in cannot download anything.

**Setup**
Qubes OS: https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-mgmt-salt

  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Use `pkg.uptodate` with `refresh=True` in a VM that is not actually able to perform the update due to lacking Internet access.

**Expected behavior**
`pkg.uptodate` should fail.
