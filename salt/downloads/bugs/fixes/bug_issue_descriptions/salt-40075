When salt-ssh sets up it's temporary location (eg. `/var/tmp/.root_xxxx_salt`), the files contained (eg. `/var/tmp/.root_xxxx_salt/running_data/var/cache/salt/minion/files`) are 0644. Some of these files may well contain sensitive data such as private keys (which when installed will be set to 0600 by the state).

The permissions may be inherited from the salt-master, but if these files come from a backend such as gitfs, they seem to have 0644 in the master gitfs cache (which in itself is a problem!)

Run the following state with `salt-ssh` and check the files located in the temporary directory on the remote host. The `mykey.key` file will be 
```
/etc/pki/tls/private/mykey.key:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://mystate/files/ssl/mykey.key
    - mode: 0600
    - user: root
    - group: root 
```

```
