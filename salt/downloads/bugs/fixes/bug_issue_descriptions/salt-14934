I am launching new minions in Amazon EC2 using this, https://gist.github.com/deuscapturus/8f18d28d1a1ccef6327c, bootstrap script in a multi-master salt environment.  The salt masters are set to auto accept keys.

Master1: salt-master-2014.1.7-3.el6.noarch
Master2: salt-master-2014.1.7-3.el6.noarch
Minion: salt-minion-2014.1.7-3.el6.noarch

When the cloudinit script starts the minion service, the log below is produced. The minion keys are rejected.  Keys on both masters are the same, but the public key on the minion is different.  How could the key change, or, why did the minion send the wrong key?

The master may need to be updated if it is a version of Salt lower than 2014.1.7, or
If you are confident that you are connecting to a valid Salt Master, then remove the master public key and restart the Salt Minion.
The master public key can be found at:
/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub
