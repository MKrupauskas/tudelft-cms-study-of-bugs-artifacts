I am trying to use file.managed to download a file from a web API to a Windows 2012 server.  Saltstack is unable to download and cache the file because the URL for the file contains a colon "\id:32035" which is an invalid character for directories in Windows.

Colons should be replaced for the purpose of the file cache with some other valid character.

```
          ID: Learner.Api-download
    Function: file.managed
        Name: D:\data\webs\Learner.Api.nupkg
      Result: False
