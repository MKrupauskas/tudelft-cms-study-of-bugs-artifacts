### Description of Issue

`cwd` option from `cmd.run` state is not working in combination with `runas` option (on macOS at least)

I have arrived to this problem through the `git.latest` and `git.cloned` states.

These states are failing with the following comment:

> fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

(Possible related issues #43185 and #586)

### Setup

#### SLS recipe

```yaml

  cmd.run:
    - name: pwd

    - cwd: /Users/Carlos/Desktop
    - runas: Carlos

### Update

The `git.latest` task was working before upgrading my saltstack minion from `2018.3.2` to `2018.3.3` (with salt-master in `2018.3.3`)

I have installed salt in my minion workstation with @Homebrew

```sh
brew install salt
```
