I'm not sure this function even belongs in this modules, but.....

The function makes an attempt to sanitize input by only allowing creation of filesystems from a pre-enumerated list of valid types and then uses `cmd.run` to execute `mkfs.${type}` for the creation of the filesystem. All modern linux ditros use the `mkfs` command as a general wrapper around all of the various type specific `mkfs` commands. No attempt should be made to pre sanitize the type specified as the actual available types will vary per system. Additionally the `salt.modules.parted.mkfs` function should allow for passing additional arguments to the underlying command such that the created filesystem may have whatever properties that the user intends/desires.
