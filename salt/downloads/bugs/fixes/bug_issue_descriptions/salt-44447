### Description of Issue/Question
The following stacktrace occurs and is logged many times when running at the head of develop. Here's a quick example using salt-call:
```
# salt-call --local test.ping
[CRITICAL] Failed to load grains defined in grain file zfs.zfs in function <function zfs at 0x7f438e6b1c08>, error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/loader.py", line 752, in grains
    ret = funcs[key]()
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/grains/zfs.py", line 109, in zfs
    grains = salt.utils.dictupdate.update(grains, _zfs_support(), merge_lists=True)
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/grains/zfs.py", line 75, in _zfs_support
    if _zfs_fuse('available') and (_zfs_fuse('status') or _zfs_fuse('start')):
  File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/grains/zfs.py", line 74, in <lambda>
    _zfs_fuse = lambda f: __salt__['service.' + f]('zfs-fuse')
KeyError: 'service.available'
```

### Setup
Run on the latest develop, this example is on Ubuntu 14, but I have seen it in test logs other places.
