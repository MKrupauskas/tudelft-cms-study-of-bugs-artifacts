I just tried using salt-cloud to do some linode provisioning today, and a configuration that has worked for well over a year is now failing with the following:

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to get the output of 'linode.avail_sizes()': [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

This is running salt 2015.5.3. Also I should add that linode api commands work fine from the command line using curl.
