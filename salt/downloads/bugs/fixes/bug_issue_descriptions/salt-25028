In my vm environment, I have one master(snail-linux), one syndic(syndic-B) and three minions(client-B1,minion_win2003,client-B2) under the syndic. The minion process on the syndic connect directly to the upper master. 
On the master, the manage.status shows the following output:

<pre><code>[root@snail-linux ~]# salt-run manage.status 
down:
up:
    - client-B1
    - minion_win2003
    - syndic-B
</code></pre>

Master result shows no down minion in the list.

On the syndic, the manage.status shows the following output:

<pre><code>[root@syndic-B ~]# salt-run manage.status
down:
    - client-B2
up:
    - client-B1
    - minion_win2003
</code></pre>

Syndic result shows the down minion(client-B2) is in the down list.

My linux version is Centos 6.6, below is the versions report in my environment on both master and minions:

<pre><code>[root@snail-linux ~]# salt-run --versions-report
           Salt: 2015.5.0
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jan 22 2014, 09:42:36)
         Jinja2: 2.2.1
       M2Crypto: 0.20.2
 msgpack-python: 0.4.2
   msgpack-pure: 0.1.3
       pycrypto: 2.0.1
        libnacl: 1.4.3
         PyYAML: 3.10
          ioflo: 1.3.6
          PyZMQ: 14.3.1
           RAET: 0.6.3
            ZMQ: 3.2.5
           Mako: 0.3.4
</code></pre>

 It seems that the manage.status command on master can get all up minions but failed to get down minions under the syndic,  could this be a problem?
