### Description of Issue/Question
A relative link-target is changed when symlinks are managed with file.recurse
The link-target is "prefixed" with the salt:// path.

I.e. a relative link:
00non-https -> ../sites-available/non-https

Is changed to:
00non-https -> webserver24/etc/apache2-prod/sites-enabled/sites-available/non-https

when using the SLS snippet below. So the "../" is replaced by "webserver24/etc/apache2-prod/".
**The problem is absent in salt-master 2016.11.2 (and prior)**
Changing salt-minion versions is not affecting the problem.

### Setup
The codesnippet from the SLS is:

```
/etc/apache2-prod-sites:
  file.recurse:
    - name: /etc/apache2/sites-available
    - source: salt://webserver24/etc/apache2-prod/sites-available
    - include_empty: True
    - keep_symlinks: True
    - clean: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just file.recurse a folder with relative symlinks with salt-master 2016.11.2 (and prior) and 2016.11.3. Symlink target changes with 2016.11.3
