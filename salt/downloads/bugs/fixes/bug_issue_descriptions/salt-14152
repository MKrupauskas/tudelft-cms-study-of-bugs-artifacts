salt-2014.1.5-1.el6.noarch

log-level=all causes system crash on when running highstate.  In this case it crashed after running pkg.installed, but previous pkg.installed's succeeded.  The system had completed several states before crashing. No issues when log-level=all was removed.

Note: The environment is AWS.  And salt-call was called from the aws init (user data), not from a user terminal.  

salt-call state.highstate --log-level=all
