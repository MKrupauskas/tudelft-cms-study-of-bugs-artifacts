Pull request #13354 breaks salt on SmartOS. SmartOS (and illumos in general) does not have `lsof` which is used [in `utils/network.py`](https://github.com/felskrone/salt/blob/314f3d06627ad39bde54f499c94024c8538e1e20/salt/utils/network.py#L953-L996).

SmartOS does ship with a dreadfully slow bash script called lsof. Here is it's usage info:

```
  lsof <pid>
     -p               Display port information for all processes
     -f               Display file information for all processes
     -P <pid>         Show all ports used by this process
     -F <pid>         Show all files used by this process
     -o <port>        Show all processes that use this port
     -i <file>        Show all processes that use this file
     -d <directory>   Show all processes that use this directory
```
