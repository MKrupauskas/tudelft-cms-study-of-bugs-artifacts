**Description**USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS
In Salt setup.py if os.environ TIAMAT_BUILD is encountered, it is assumed that USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS   is required. This is incorrect since some platforms cannot use the latest versions of modules, for example: cryptography now leverages Rust libraries, but that is not available for Solaris 10, perhaps not even Solaris 11.
On AIX, there is a pre-built python3-cryptography version 2.8 which is preferable to use, rather than the latest v3.3.x, since it has been tested by IBM, also no system version of Rust available.
Also Juniper is using older versions of FreeBSD which may not have the appropriate version too.,

This requires an ability to override that decision for those platforms, otherwise will need to patch Salt for every release.

Example of code in setup.py
```
  94 USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS = os.environ.get("USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS")
  95 if USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS is not None:
  96     USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS = USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS == "1"
  97 # Are we running pop-build
  98 if "TIAMAT_BUILD" in os.environ:
  99     USE_STATIC_REQUIREMENTS = True
 100 
```

The change could be made for TIAMAT_BUILD in Tiamat, but it is Salt that is making the incorrect assumption.
