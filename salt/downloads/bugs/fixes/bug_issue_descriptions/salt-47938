### Description of Issue/Question

If you make a mistake and don't use a list in the top sls file for a single entry, it results in a weird error.

### Setup

`pillar/top.sls`:
```
base:
  '*':
    nginx
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
$ salt-call .... state.apply ...

local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Specified SLS 'n' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
----------
    Specified SLS 'g' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
----------
    Specified SLS 'i' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
----------
    Specified SLS 'x' in environment 'base' is not available on the salt master
```

Instead of saying something like "host expects a list of SLSs rather than a string `nginx`", salt tries to iterate what it's got, resulting in checking state for each letter of the name.
Since this is unlikely to ever be the expected behaviour, salt should reject simple strings in that location.
