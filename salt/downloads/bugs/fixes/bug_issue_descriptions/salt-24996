The --failhard parameter for the salt command is supposed to stop batch execution upon first "bad" return. This is not happening even when failhard = True in the master config.
Quick example:
`salt -b 1 --failhard 'nginx*' cmd.run 'systemctl restart nginx'`
is executing in all targetted systems regardless of the error return code. It should stop the batch execution at the first failed execution.
