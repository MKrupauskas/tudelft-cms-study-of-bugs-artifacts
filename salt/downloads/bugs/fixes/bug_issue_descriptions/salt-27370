salt/states/module.py:212 was updated to fix this symptom in some context, but the new logic appears to result in an invariant condition, and the fixed condition (or -> and) doesn't help, either.

In our case, we do something like this:

``` saltstack
A:
  module.run:
    - name: pkg.group_install
    - m_name:
      - a
      - b
      - c
    - m_skip:
      - missing_package
```

The groups are expanded into packages, and one of the packages is not installed.  Yum tries to install it, but fails, because the package doesn't exist.  This seems like a bug because the package is supposed to be skipped.  The resulting change is still {}, however.  But then, the state is still reported as changed.

Symptomatically, this is probably two distinct issues, but we're encountering them in tandem.
