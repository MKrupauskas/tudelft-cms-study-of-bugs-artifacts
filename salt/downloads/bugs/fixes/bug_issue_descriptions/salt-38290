Using Salt 2016.3.3

I've just been testing a bit with the salt.modules.chocolatey and I discovered an issue with the chocolatey list --local-only calls. Calling salt * chocolatey.list local_only=True was returning extra data. It needs the `--limit-output` argument added to the `--local-only` so that it doesn't print the "XX packages installed" or the "Chocolatey v0.10.3", both of which gets parsed into the data returned as `packages: - XX` and `Chocolatey: - v0.10.3` while the rest of the packages have a strictly SemVer compatible version.

I'll open a PR to at least fix the calls to `choco list`, but using the `--limit-output` should return data structures for almost all choco calls which should make wrapping them easier.
