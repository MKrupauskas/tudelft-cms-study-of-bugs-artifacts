Since a few days i can't select minions anymore based on grains.
I searched on github and only found https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/16782 but that's a different error.

```
$ salt -G "virtual:VMware" test.ping         
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

```

I have multiple masters for different environments and only one has this issue.
So it looks like a mismatch in caching or something.
Restarting the master does not help.
Now i could remove the cache in /var/cache/salt/master/minions but i don't know what that will do or if it's save.
In any case i think it should be looked at why this error is thrown.
