The nova execution module should try to check if discover_extensions exists before using it. It is neither available in python-novaclient 2:2.23.0-1~bpo8+1 (from jessie-backports) nor in python-novaclient 2:2.18.1-1 (from jessie).

A quick look at the python-novaclient project seems to show that this has been introduced in version 2.24.0 â€¦ 

It seems that this was introduced in pull request https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/28041 ping @gtmanfred @techhat @rallytime 

I think this is a bug, or a missing catch or at least a documentation missing (but I would rather these modules depended on versions that are packaged and shipped for distributions).
