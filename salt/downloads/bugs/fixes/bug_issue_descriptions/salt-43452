### Description of Issue/Question
When `couchbase.get_load` is called after `couchbase.prep_jid` but before `couchbase.save_load` then a `KeyError` is thrown in the following line
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/returners/couchbase_return.py#L219
This is because `prep_jid` will write a document `{nocache: False}` with key `JID` but `load` will not be in the doc yet as save_load has not been called. This order of execution ( prep_jid > get_load > save_load) is seen in `utils.job.store_job`

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b4ca024e44353bb9b5cc5e73d7de6db27a85ed80/salt/utils/job.py#L104-L105

### Setup
 `master_job_cache: couchbase` in master configs

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1) Fix the following lines and replace `'get_load'` with `getfstr`
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b4ca024e44353bb9b5cc5e73d7de6db27a85ed80/salt/utils/job.py#L103
This is so that `get_load` gets called while trying to `save_load` (Issue #43453)
2) Fire a runner `test.stdout_print`
3) Lookup the return for the runner just fired. `salt-run jobs.lookup_jid <runner_jid>`
Observe `KeyError`
