### Description of Issue/Question
The module function `boto_vpc.create_nat_gateway()` [accepts an `allocation_id` parameter](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/boto_vpc.py#L1312), which allows users to specify the Elastic IP they want to assign to it. However, adding that parameter to the state function results in the following:

```
Warnings:
'allocation_id' is an invalid keyword argument for 'boto_vpc.nat_gateway_present'. If you were trying to pass additional data to be used in a template context, please populate 'context' with 'key: value' pairs. Your approach will work until Salt Nitrogen is out. Please update your state files.
```

This makes sense as the parameter isn't in the method's declaration.

This problem can be worked around by simply calling the module from your state with a `module.run` but we're better than that :)

I have a PR I'll file for this shortly.

### Setup
Salt 2016.11.2 on Centos 7. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Attempt to execute the state `boto_vpc.nat_gateway_present` and provide the `allocation_id` parameter. E.g.

```
  boto_vpc.nat_gateway_present:
    - name: {{ nat_gw }}
    - allocation_id: {{ allocation_id }}
    - subnet_name: {{ subnet_name }}
    - region: {{ region }}
    - profile: {{ profile }}
```
