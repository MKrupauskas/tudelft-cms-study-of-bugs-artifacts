### Description of Issue/Question

`pkgrepo.managed` seems to append garbage/failures to the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/whatever.list`, even if it failed to "validate."

My instinct on this is that it should only write to that file if there were no state failures, _and_ if there were no errors, it _should_ overwrite that file, _not_ append to it.  After all, we are literally telling this file what it should be.
### Setup

We discovered this on Ubuntu.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Add garbage:

```
mongodb-repo:
    pkgrepo.managed:
        - name: deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu LETS_ADD_GARBAGE trusty/mongodb-org/3.0 multiverse
        - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list
```

Oops!  Fix it, and run the same thing, without 'LETS_ADD_GARBAGE', and possibly other things, like `keyid`, and `keyserver` that are needed to make it _actually work_.  My instinct is that when I correct the syntax (remove 'LETS_ADD_GARBAGE'), and add any missing kwargs it needs, that it would work.  It doesn't.  The `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list` will contain the failure string in the file.
