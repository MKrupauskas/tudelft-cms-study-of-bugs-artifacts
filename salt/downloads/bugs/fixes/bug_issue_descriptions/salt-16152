In SaltStack 2014.1.10, when cloning a repository on windows, the identity parameter is not escaping windows paths correctly.

I expected the state below to work, however that resulted a bad path to the identity file.

```
git@github.com:saltstack/salt.git:
  git.latest:
    - target: 'D:\Souce\Salt'
    - identity: 'C:\Users\carolyn\.ssh\github_rsa'
```

I had to escape the `\` character, which seems inconsistent.

```
git@github.com:saltstack/salt.git:
  git.latest:
    - target: 'D:\Souce\Salt'
    - identity: 'C:\\Users\\carolyn\\.ssh\\github_rsa'
```
