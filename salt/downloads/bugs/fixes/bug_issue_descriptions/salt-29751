Hi there,

We found a small regression by updating a salt minion, commit e262173b introduced a change in the behavior of `network.mod_hostname` function.
If `hostnamectl` is found on the machine, `network.mod_hostname` will do an early return and won't change (for example) the `/etc/hosts` file as it would have done previously.

Regards.

EDIT: I did not know that `hostnamectl set-hostname` modified the provided hostname (for me, it lowercased it). If the behavior of modifying other system files is restored, you may want to pay attention to that detail (tested with systemd 215 on a Debian Jessie system).
