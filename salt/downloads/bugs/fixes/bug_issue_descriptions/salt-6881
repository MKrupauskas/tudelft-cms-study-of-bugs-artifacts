Starting in 0.16.3, I've started having issues with running highstates via the command salt 'hostname' state.highstate when there's a lot of work to be done. The highstate runs, but salt terminates and goes back to the command line after only 1-3 minutes with an exit code of 0. If I lookup all the jobs, I can see it runs and salt will do a saltutil.find_job a couple times before salt quits prematurely and if I lookup the highstate jid, it ran fine.  This is not happening every single time, but in my tests today, it was happening the majority of time.

Example Tests:
Test #1 - provision fresh VM with salt-cloud, highstate returned as it should after 3m1s
Test #2 - provision fresh VM with salt-cloud, salt exits with no data returned after 1m52s

This is the versions output for the salt master and minion
