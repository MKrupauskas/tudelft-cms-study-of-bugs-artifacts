Invert iptables rules appear not to be working anymore after upgrading to 2017.7.0 from 2016.x

My iptables rule in salt stack is:

```
unmatched packets:
  iptables.append:
    - table: filter
    - chain: INPUT
    - jump: DROP
    - match:
      - tcp
      - state
    - tcp-flags: "! FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN"
    - proto: tcp
    - connstate: NEW
    - save: True
```

When it tries to apply the iptables rule, it fails with:

```
----------
          ID: unmatched packets
    Function: iptables.append
      Result: False
     Comment: Failed to set iptables rule for unmatched packets.
              Attempted rule was /sbin/iptables  -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp -m tcp -m state --state NEW ! --tcp-flags ! FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN --jump DROP for ipv4
     Started: 16:24:30.614774
    Duration: 48.855 ms
     Changes:
```

The generated rule *should* look like:

```
/sbin/iptables  -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp -m tcp -m state --state NEW ! --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN --jump DROP
```

or 

```
/sbin/iptables  -t filter -A INPUT  -p tcp -m tcp -m state --state NEW --tcp-flags ! FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN --jump DROP
```

although the first one is the more acceptable rules as the second one is technically deprecated syntax.

Both systems are running CentOS 6.x (although I see the same issues on CentOS 7.x) and all systems are running the following salt version.
