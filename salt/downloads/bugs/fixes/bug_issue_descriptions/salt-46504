### Description of Issue
It is impossible to use `ntp.managed` function on non-english versions of Windows Server 2016. I think the problem is in `win_ntp.py`:
```
if 'command completed successfully' not in ret:
            return False
```
A `command completed successfully` string is only returned in EN version of Windows. In other languages this string differs.

### Setup
```
win_ntp:
  ntp.managed:
    - servers:
      - ntp21.vniiftri.ru,0x8
      - pool.ntp.org,0x8
      - time.windows.com,0x8
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run `ntp.managed` on Windows Server 2016 (EN) and get (as expected):
```
ID: win_ntp
  Function: ntp.managed
    Result: True
```
2. Run the same `ntp.managed` on Windows Server 2016 (RU) and get:
```
ID: win_ntp
  Function: ntp.managed
    Result: False
   Comment: Failed to update NTP servers
```
