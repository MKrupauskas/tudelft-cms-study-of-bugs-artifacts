In some cases it's necessary or desired to specify an architecture in an apt sources file using the "Vendor" field.

Here's some information on this:

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec#apt_sources

Use case looks like this:

```
deb [arch=i386,amd64] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main restricted
```

This is useful only in rare cases and I've only ever used it as a hack to get around remote repositories that are basically misconfigured and missing a Packages file for say, `binary-i386`.

I imagine it would be pretty easy to allow an additional 'vendor' keyword for pkgrepo.managed, but I haven't dug into the code yet.

Is this something you'd be interested in adding or is it too much of an 'edge-case' to be worth the trouble?  If so I could look into adding it.
