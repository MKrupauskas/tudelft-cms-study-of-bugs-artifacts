### Description of Issue/Question

In case the minion ID is not in an expected format (something like "id: app-`cat /etc/hostname`"), then the minion log shows the following warning:
```
[CRITICAL] The Salt Master has rejected this minion's public key!
To repair this issue, delete the public key for this minion on the Salt Master and restart this minion.
Or restart the Salt Master in open mode to clean out the keys. The Salt Minion will now exit.
```
The salt-master writes the correct log output in this case:
```
[INFO    ] Authentication request from invalid id app-`cat /etc/hostname`
```
It would be less confusing if the error message on the minion would be something similar such that debugging takes less time.

### Setup

Freshly installed master/minion setup.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install `salt-master` on one machine and `salt-minion` on another. Add the following entry to minion config:

```
id: app-`cat /etc/hostname`
```

Attempt to start the `salt-minion` service.
