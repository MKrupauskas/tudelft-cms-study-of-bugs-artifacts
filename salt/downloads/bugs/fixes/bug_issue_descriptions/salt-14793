Hi there, 

we can successfully spin up vms on azure (as seen in the web management portal), but salt-cloud does not seem to get any response and waits until it times out after 900 seconds.

Here is the output:

```

The machine is up and running:

```
$ azure vm list | grep salt-deployed-machine
data:    salt-deployed-machine  ReadyRole           West Europe  salt-deployed-machine.cloudapp.net  <ip>  
```

We tried with stable and current develop branch:

```
# salt --version
salt 2014.7.0-n/a-91bebba (Helium)
# salt-cloud --version
salt-cloud 2014.7.0-n/a-91bebba (Helium)
```

Also, please notice the trace "Failed to execute 'azure.list_nodes()' while querying for running nodes: invalid literal for int() with base 10: " - not sure if this has to do with it or is just cosmetic.

BTW: What exactly should happen now? Is it something like waiting from azure to get the hostname so salt can go and install minion through ssh or is it waiting for the minion to respond with the hostname?

Thanks!
