### Description of Issue/Question

Hello everyone. 

I have a few Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8 LXC minions installed with salt-bootstrap that i recently updated via apt-get (altough i am almost certain it didn't work before the update either) running 2016.11.x on which the InfluxDB returner is broken. 
After thorough debugging i noticed that its code (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/returners/influxdb_return.py) contains the following block:

```
@memoize
def _get_version(host, port, user, password):
    version = None
    # check the InfluxDB version via the HTTP API
    try:
        result = requests.get("http://{0}:{1}/ping".format(host, port), auth=(user, password))
        if result.status_code == 200 and influxDBVersionHeader in result.headers:
            version = result.headers[influxDBVersionHeader]
    except Exception as ex:
        log.critical('Failed to query InfluxDB version from HTTP API within InfluxDB returner: {0}'.format(ex))
    return version
```

This can't possibly work since InfluxDB's return code on /ping is 204, not 200 ( [link to official docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/tools/api/#ping) ) . It seems this was introduced in the 2016.11 version (2016.3 and develop are with different code in this part).

The result is:
```
[CRITICAL] Failed to query InfluxDB version from HTTP API within InfluxDB returner: Failed to parse: None:None
[CRITICAL] Failed to store return with InfluxDB returner: Failed to parse: None:None
```

Should i make a PR to fix this in 2016.3 or should i move to develop(and how can i do that ?) ?
