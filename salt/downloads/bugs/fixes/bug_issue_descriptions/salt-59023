**Description**

I am unable to install the latest version of salt-ssh on Big Sur using pip install because pyobjc is not yet available as wheels for the platform, and pyobjc-framework-qtkit is not available at all for the system and is included in the long list of things to be installed.

Could `pyobjc` please be dropped from needing to be installed when using `salt-ssh`? 

It was added in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/49657. As can be seen here, Home-brew explicitly removes Pyobjc: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/52835/files#diff-bc5e9d274249d233b46373ab6e8d252ebb9cd1b50721a67e3163f5fa0207af06R65 by patching the file before installing, because PyobjC is known to be a major pain point.

**Setup**

On Big Sur:

```
/usr/bin/python3 -mvenv ~/salt/
~/salt/bin/pip install -U wheel pip
~/salt/bin/pip install salt-ssh
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

```
/usr/bin/python3 -mvenv ~/salt/
~/salt/bin/pip install -U wheel pip
~/salt/bin/pip install salt-ssh
```

**Expected behavior**

salt-ssh is installed and available for me to manage my remote hosts.

**Versions Report**

salt-ssh is not installed, so whatever the latest version is that pip downloads
