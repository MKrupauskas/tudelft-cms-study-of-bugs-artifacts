Using salt-ssh, after upgrading from `v2014.7.0rc2` to `2014.7.0rc2-537-g22f6d06`, I've been unable to get commands to complete at all.

A simple `test.ping` hangs indefinitely, but when I add `-l debug` it does eventually complete! (In about 50 seconds from cold).

A `grains.get foo` hangs both with and without `-l debug` seeming to stop part way through the debug logging of the job result payload.
