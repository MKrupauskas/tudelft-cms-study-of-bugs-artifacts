Specifying -b option for salt client causes command to hang.

Version of salt-master: 2014.1.4+ds-2~bpo70+1  (installed via deb package)
python                               2.7.3-4+deb7u1 

Verified also in earlier versions of salt.

To reproduce:
`salt -L host1 -b 10 grains.item fqdn`

Expected result:
`host1 Detected for this batch run
Executing run on ['host1']
host1:
    fqdn: host1`

Actual result:

```
host1 Detected for this batch run
host1 Detected for this batch run
host1 Detected for this batch run

Executing run on ['host1']
host1:
  fqdn: host1

Executing run on ['host1']
host1:
  fqdn: host1

Executing run on ['host1']
host1:
  fqdn: host1

[command does not exit. 10sec timeout configured. no good.]
```

Funny thing is - command works fine and exits when batch size is not specified.

After bit of digging I found out that 3 instances of salt-minion were running on host1
