### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

**Minimal state**:
```yaml
example:
  boto_cfn.present:
    - template_body: salt://does/not/exist
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

1. Create a state using the `boto_cfn.present` function.
1. Set `template_url` or `template_body` to an invalid value.
1. Apply the state on a minion.

Instead of the state failing with a useful message, the following stacktrace is displayed:

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1735, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1653, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/contextlib.py", line 34, in __exit__
    self.gen.throw(type, value, traceback)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/utils/context.py", line 48, in func_globals_inject
    yield
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1653, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/boto_cfn.py", line 147, in present
    code, message = _get_error(_valid)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/boto_cfn.py", line 263, in _get_error
    error = '\n'.join(error.split('\n')[1:])
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'split'
```

The source of the problem is line 147 in `boto_cfn.py`. When an error occurs in the `_validate` function, a tuple containing a code and message is returned. Then it tries to parse the tuple as if it were an error message, which fails when attempting to split the tuple.

```python
    _valid = _validate(template_body, template_url, region, key, keyid, profile)
    log.debug('Validate is : {0}.'.format(_valid))
    if _valid is not True:
        code, message = _get_error(_valid) # fails here
    ...
```

Since the error is already parsed, it just needs to be set without further processing.

```python
    _valid = _validate(template_body, template_url, region, key, keyid, profile)
    log.debug('Validate is : {0}.'.format(_valid))
    if _valid is not True:
        code, message = _valid # fixed
    ...
```
