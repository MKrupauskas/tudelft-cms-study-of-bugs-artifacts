you have to manually run `salt \* saltutil.refresh_pillar`  Is there any reason why you wouldn't want this done when you say sync_all?

Further, until you run refresh_pillar, pillar.data XXX shows the _new_ (master side, unsynced) data, but pillar.get XXX shows the old code, as did config.get and pillar.raw.  Why would these show different things?

Footnote: the docs on saltutil.sync_all say "Sync down all of the dynamic modules from the file server for a specific environment"  The word "modules" has very specific meanings in salt, and I don't think it's clear in this doc step that "dynamic modules" means "modules, states, grains returners...."  (but not pillars, hence this bug;)
