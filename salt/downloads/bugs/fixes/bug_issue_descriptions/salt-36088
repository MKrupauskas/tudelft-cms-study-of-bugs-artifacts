### Description of Issue/Question

Executing a pkg state on Windows causes a pkg repo refresh EVERY time. This causes states to be very slow unnecessarily.
### Setup

install Salt from Carbon or Develop branch on Windows.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Execute a salt pkg state like this:

```
salt davewintest state.single pkg.installed name=filezilla
```
