**Description**
Salt minions are throwing this error:
```
2021-02-16 10:11:20,906 [salt.minion      :2879][CRITICAL][20902] The beacon errored: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 2877, in handle_beacons
    beacons = self.process_beacons(self.functions)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 516, in process_beacons
    b_conf, self.opts["grains"]
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/beacons/__init__.py", line 75, in process
    b_config[mod].append({"_beacon_name": mod})
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
```
It looks like /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/beacons/\_\_init\_\_.py is attempting to append a value to this b_config[mod] dictionary, instead of updating the dictionary.

```
 75             b_config[mod].append({"_beacon_name": mod})
```

Unless b_config[mod] is a list of individual dictionaries, which it very well may be given the layout of a yaml based config for a beacon, this should be an update() not append()

**Setup**
I have an empty /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf on the minion.
```
beacons:
  beacons: {}
```
Perhaps the empty dictionary here is causing the error?


**Expected behavior**
This error should not be thrown if updating the dict
