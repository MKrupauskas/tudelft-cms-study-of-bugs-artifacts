### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
OS: FreeBSD 11.1
Salt version: py27-salt-2017.7.1_1

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use the following sls to create snapshots
  zfs.scheduled_snapshot:
    - name: storage/test
    - prefix: test
    - schedule:
        hour: 168
        day: 60 
        month: 9999 
        year: 999
One hour later, run it again, no new snapshots created.

By checking the code, I found
```

   790         # create snapshot
    791         needed_holds = []
    792         current_timestamp = gmtime()
    793         for hold in snapshots:
    794             # check if we need need to consider hold
    795             if schedule[hold] == 0:
    796                 continue
    797
```

I think this is caused by the following line:
`current_timestamp = gmtime()`

After I changed it to 
`current_timestamp = localtime()`
It worked.
