I stumbled on a quirk/bug in user management regarding home directories.

It seems a user's home directory only created and set during the first state.highstate.  If the home directory is removed or changed, it is not recreated or set during subsequent state.highstate.

I suppose we could look into managing the home directories by using the file.directory function.
