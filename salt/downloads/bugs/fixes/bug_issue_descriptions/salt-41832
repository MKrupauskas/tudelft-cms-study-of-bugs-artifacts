### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

Error when i want to deploy a Microsoft VMs with SALT-CLOUD & Vmware driver.

I don't have problem with the deployement of Linux VMs.

A message in the LOG show "The vCenter Server is unable to decrypt passwords stored in the customization specification."

In the past, with VCSA 5.5, i didn't had problem.

i've see this -> https://github.com/nmadhok/saltconf16/blob/master/SAMPLES/vmware-sdb_setup.sh but i think it's only a store the Vsphere/VCSA password.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

VCSA 6.5
SALT MASTER & SALT CLOUD 2016.11.5
PYVMOMI last version
