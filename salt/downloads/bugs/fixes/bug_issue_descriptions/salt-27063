I just installed salt v2015.8.0 from the rpm hosted at https://repo.saltstack.com/yum, and it seems it's not creating `/var/log/salt` before attempting to write to the minion log. This results in the warning message, "[WARNING ] Failed to open log file, do you have permission to write to /var/log/salt/minion?". I uninstalled and reinstalled, and got the same behavior. If I manually create the directory, the message goes away and the minion log is created.

I removed v2015.8.0 and installed v2015.5.3 from epel, and it seems to create the directory the first time it attempts to write to the minion log.

```
# salt-call --local grains.get os
