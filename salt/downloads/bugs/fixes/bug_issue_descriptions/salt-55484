### Description of Issue
Issue #52805 requested pymssql lib to be included in the Salt windows package. This was merged in #52827. Pull request #53408 (commit b9618f6) removed pymssql from reqs.txt.

Was it intended to reverse the inclusion of pymssql with Salt? I believe inclusion would be good as working with mssql is a common scenario for windows minions.
