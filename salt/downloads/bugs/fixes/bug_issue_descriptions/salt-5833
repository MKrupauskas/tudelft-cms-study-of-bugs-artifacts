Salt's git state and git module do not honor the identity file for `git submodule`.

This can be a problem when using the git.latest state with `submodules: True`. The private key is used for the initial clone but not for the submodules which will cause the state to fail.

The docs for git.latest clearly state that an identity can be used and this can be misleading:

```
identity
    A path to a private key to use over SSH
```

I've attached a pull request to fix this. Additionally, we need to consider when submodules need to use another private key that is different from the private key that is being used for the cloned repository.
