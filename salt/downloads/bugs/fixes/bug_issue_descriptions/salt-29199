salt-minion in daemon mode process dies instead of restarting itself

The salt-minion is configured to give up and restart itself when no masters are reachable after all the retries are exhausted so that it self recovers.

When I run salt-minion in daemon mode:

```
salt-minion -l trace -d
tail -f /var/log/salt/minion
```

This is the end of the log and the salt-minion process never comes back:

```
2015-11-25 16:01:42,672 [salt.scripts                             ][WARNING ][10770] ** Restarting minion **
2015-11-25 16:01:42,672 [salt.scripts                             ][INFO    ][10770] Sleeping random_reauth_delay of 6 seconds
```

ps -ef | grep salt returns no salt-minion processes.

If I run this not as a daemon:

```
salt-minion -l trace
```

It correctly restarts itself and stays alive.

This is a problem because typically we run salt-minion using the service, which runs it in daemon mode.
i.e. service salt-minion start
