Tested on fedora 21, but it may affect other RPM packages. Package is `salt.noarch 2014.7.0-3.fc21 @updates-testing`

I think the spec file (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/pkg/rpm/salt.spec#L171) just needs `-m 0644` added to the line with the logrotate config file, but I'm not at all familiar with RPM build specs.

If you want, I can submit a pull request with this change if that's what you think the correct action is.
