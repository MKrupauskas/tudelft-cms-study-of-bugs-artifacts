I'm having a bizzare issue where defaults.get exhibits different behavior depending on whether a state is being run from highstate or not. 

Specifically: I have a state that uses file.managed to manage a file. The source for that file is a jinja template that executes `salt['defaults.get'](somedict:somekey)` in a number of places.

If I run `salt-call state.sls <statename>`, the managed file is created correctly. 
If I run `salt-call state.highstate` and bring in <statename> via top, all defaults.get calls appear to return empty strings. 
If I put defaults.get calls in the state itself, rather than a managed template, they return the correct values during highstate. 

This leaves me _extremely_ confused. The relevant bit of code appears to be lines 90-115 in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/defaults.py. I inserted some extra lines to log the value of `sls` after the loop, and found that it remained None when it should not. Further, I found that replacing None with the correct value made the state run correctly (though obviously I can't leave it that way because that is all kinds of terrible).

To repro:

Make a state that uses file.managed on a jinja template.
Call defaults.get from the template. (and have appropriate values in pillar or defaults.yaml)
Include the state in top.
Run state.highstate.
