The mongodb daemon crashes when the LANG environmental variable is not set to something like `en_US.UTF-8`. On Debian Wheezy, out of the box `service mongodb start` won't work. The solution requires setting the default locale, but while salt is able to do that properly using the locale state, it is not able to pass it to the service state.

Since the `service` binary on the a default Wheezy installation execute `/etc/init.d/` scripts using $LANG, I'm kind of stuck.

What do you suggest in this situation? Thanks.
