### Expected Behavior

To be able to pull files via s3:// protocol from Google Cloud Storage.
### Actual Behavior

Authentication fails.  It appears that GCS only supports the v2 aws authentication signature for s3:// access, while Salt now only supports v4
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create a storage bucket in GCS, turn on interoperability, and generate a secret key and access key.  In salt minion config set s3.key_id: and s3.access_key: with the generated keys, and set "s3.service_url: storage.googleapis.com".  When attempting to access a bucket the salt minion will log "<Error><Code>InvalidSecurity</Code><Message>The provided security credentials are not valid.</Message><\Details>Incorrect Authorization header</Details></Error>"

### Relevant Logs, Configs, or States

Pre- 2015.5.5 the above steps work without an issue - files can be successfully pulled from GCS via s3://.  I'm assuming it's due to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/25420 .  We have been working with an older version of Salt and have only recently encountered this issue while trying to upgrade for some other bugfixes.  It would be great if Salt would fall back to v2 after a v4 auth attempt fails, or if there was a setting like "s3.sig_version: 2" we could set in the minion config.
