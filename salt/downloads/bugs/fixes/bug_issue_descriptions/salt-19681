According to [the documentation](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/renderers/all/salt.renderers.jinja.html#calling-salt-functions) it is now possible to call salt functions using a nicer syntax (`salt.cmd.run('whoami')`), however this form raises the following error when run via salt-ssh:

> Rendering SLS failed: Jinja variable 'function object' has no attribute 'run'.

`salt-ssh` has the correct version:

> # salt-ssh --version
> salt-ssh 2014.7.0 (Helium)

Therefore, either the documentation is false or this improvement does not apply to `salt-ssh` for some reason.
