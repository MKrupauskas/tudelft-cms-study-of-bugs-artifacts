I'm getting the same error message about not being able to cache the script file as #11189, but I don't have a path issue because when I run the command module version, it works fine. Also I can call `cp.get_file` using the same path and that works too.

This state:

```
SetupMySql:
  cmd.script:
    - name: salt://mysql/setup_mysql.bat {{grains['host']}} {{pillar['mysql_password']}} Dump20140407.sql
```

Results in this error:

```
          ID: SetupMySql
    Function: cmd.script
        Name: salt://mysql/setup_mysql.bat gsdev1 atgcloud Dump20140407.sql
      Result: False
     Comment: Unable to cache script salt://mysql/setup_mysql.bat gsdev1 atgcloud Dump20140407.sql from env None

But `salt hostname cmd.script salt://mysql/setup_mysql.bat 'arg1 arg2 arg3'` works fine.
