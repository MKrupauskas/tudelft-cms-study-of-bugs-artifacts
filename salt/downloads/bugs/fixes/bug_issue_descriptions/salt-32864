### Description of Issue/Question

In the salt-cloud map docs, there is a section for [setting up new salt masters](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/cloud/map.html#setting-up-new-salt-masters)

In my environment, I am running salt-cloud from a master of masters ("mom") and am trying to use a map file to create a syndic master and its minions by specifying one of the hosts should be the new master via `make_master:True` parameter.

Unfortunately, I am encountering three problems:

(1) On run of the map, salt-cloud creates the syndic, but at the end it errors-out with the following message

```
Error: There was a query error: Host for new master l-syndic-101.mycompany.com was not found, aborting map
```

The host is in DNS, I can ping the host from the "mom", so I'm not sure why salt-cloud doesn't like this host.

I figure at this point, I can just try the map file again. Salt-cloud sees that the syndic exists so goes on to create the minion. The salt-minion service fails to start due to the remaining two problems

(2) The minion's config file is showing `master: salt` instead of the expected `master: l-syndic-101.mycompany.com`

(3) If I do a 'salt-key' on the "mom" I find the minion's key in the accepted key list.

It seems what I am trying to do is not working at all. Is this expected functionality? Is it possible to build a syndic and it's minions from the mom from a salt-cloud map file?
### Setup

map file `lab-generic`

```
lab-generic-syndic:
  - l-syndic-101.mycompany.com:
      make_master: True
      minion:
        master: s-cdc-stmom-01.mycompany.com
        local_master: True
      master:
        syndic_master: s-cdc-stmom-01.mycompany.com
lab-generic-tiny:
  - l-minion-101.mycompany.com
```

profile `lab-generic-syndic`

```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

salt-cloud -m lab-generic -l debug -P
