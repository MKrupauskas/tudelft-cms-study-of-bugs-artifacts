### Description of the Issue/Bug 
The slack.py engine in Salt will fry the CPU at 100% (or at least one core) due to a missing time.sleep(1) statement at the end of the main "while True:" loop in the main "start" function of the slack.py engine

Adding a "time.sleep(1)" indented with 12 spaces at line no. 227 solves the issue.
This regards /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/engines/slack.py on my local install.

### Setup
Here are the relevant parts in /etc/salt/master:
```
engines:
  - slack:
      token: 'xoxb-supersecret'
      control: True
      valid_users:
        - saltuser
      valid_commands:
        - test.ping
        - cmd.run
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Configure the slack engine with above config (or similar) and start salt-master
