 `no_chown` option is ignored in  pip.installed state.
The state was working correctly before 2016.3.0 (Boron)
### Setup

Salt state

``` SALT
virtualenv_setup:
   pip.installed:
      - bin_env: /opt/penta/env/project
      - user: penta
      - requirements: /opt/penta/project/requirements.txt
      - no_chown: True
      - use_wheel: True
```

/opt/penta/project/requirements.txt contains

```
-r base.txt
uWSGI==2.0.12
```
