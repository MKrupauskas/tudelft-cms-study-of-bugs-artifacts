I have noticed a possible issue with installing the same yum package for 64 
and 32 bit architectures. This came about when I went from the 0.17 line to 2014.1.1-1 on CentOS 6.5 using the EPEL RPMs.

I roll some custom RPMs for some file integrity software we run.  I compile 
them such that a specific central logging server (we have several) is built in 
to the RPM.  For example I call the RPM used on our office servers "samhain-
office".  These are the two files I produce, each built on a VM for the specific 
OS and arch:

```
samhain-office-3.0.13-1.i386.rpm
samhain-office-3.0.13-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Each server is pointed to the appropriate custom RPM repo (64 or 32 bit) where the files lives.

Then I use salt to install them:

```
# Samhain Software
samhain-office:
  pkg.installed:
  - require:
    - pkg: samhain-deps

# Software needed to run Samhain
samhain-deps:
  pkg.installed:
    - names:
      - gnupg2
      - libacl
      - libattr
      - pcre
      - zlib
      - zlib-devel
```

This worked great before 2014.1.  Now if I run a highstate on the 64-bit 
CentOS 6.5 box, it works as before.  But if I do it on the 32-bit CentOS 6.5 
server:

```
      ID: samhain-office
      Function: pkg.installed
      Result: False
     Comment: Package 'samhain-office' not found (possible matches: samhain-
office.i386)
     Changes:
```

Thanks.
