The recipe as written (as of 2015.8.1) doesn't set the password correctly if it contains a dollar-sign "$"
On the command line: `rabbitmqctl change_password guest te\$t` # works

However, if we send 'te\$t' to RabbitmqUser.present(), the backslash gets escaped twice i.e. 'te\\$t' gets sent to change_password
i.e. On the command line: `rabbitmqctl change_password guest te\\\\$t` # is not the right password

If we send 'te$t' then rabbitmq doesn't have the correct password i.e. we can't log in.
i.e. On the command line: `rabbitmqctl change_password guest te$t` # doesn't set the right password
