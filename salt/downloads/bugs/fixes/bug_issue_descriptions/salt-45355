### Description of Issue/Question
running `salt-run manage.present` never returns Windows minions, even if they are online. This is not optimal...

### Setup
Put `presence_events: True` in `/etc/salt/master` and restart the master service.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
run this:
```
:~# for x in $( salt-run manage.present | cut -d\  -f2 ); do salt-run cache.grains tgt=$x --out=json | jq .[].os; done
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Deepin"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Debian"
"Ubuntu"
```
...and yet...
```
:~# for x in $( salt \* test.ping | grep -B1 True | grep -v True | cut -d\: -f1 ); do salt-run cache.grains tgt=$x --out=json | jq .[].os; done
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Deepin"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Debian"
"Ubuntu"
"Ubuntu"
"Windows"
```

this was verified on two completely separate salt deployments, both with Windows minions, both of them ignore Windows in `manage.present`. All the clients have the `ipv4` grain set, including the Windows minions (not that manage.present should depend on that anyway, but what do I know).
