**Description**

I wanted a place to track several items I'm finding related to the new website functionality. These can be broken up into smaller issues/tasks.

- [ ] Blog posts don't contain general information normally found with blog posts: timestamp of post, timestamp of last updated, etc. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59759
- [ ] Blog posts, podcasts, etc. can't be searched. They can only be eyeballed when looking at each page of posts. Need more details - searching bar added or more metadata available?
- [ ] Event calendar navigation: Events are hard to navigate. There isn't an ability to download calendar file items. Add plugin for Events and likely purchase plugin addons for flat fee
- [ ] Event calendar zoom links: Zoom links appear on the home page, but not on the events page. Can be added to the theme or template or simply add the block in the event body
