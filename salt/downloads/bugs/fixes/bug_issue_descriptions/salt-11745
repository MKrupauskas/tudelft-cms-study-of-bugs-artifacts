Using salt on debian, minion file backups made in one-cipher days of month are named non-standard, eg. httpd.conf_Thu_Apr__3_09:58:24_373542_2014 insted of httpd.conf_Thu_Apr_03_09:58:24_373542_2014 and thus salt cannot use them.

File naming is caused by python function time.asctime() returning string with one-digit day of month. Tested on debian default python 2.6 and 2.7.
