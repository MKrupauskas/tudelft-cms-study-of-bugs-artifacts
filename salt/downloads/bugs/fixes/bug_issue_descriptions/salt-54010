### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->
The `tuned.active` module call fails with a stack trace on systems with tune-adm 2.10.0

```
# salt 'mon1*' tuned.active
mon1.ceph:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1664, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/tuned.py", line 77, in active
        return '{0}'.format(match.group('profile'))
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```


### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Remove any active profiles.  The tuned-adm command should output the following:

```
# tuned-adm active
No current active profile.
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Run `salt-call tuned.active` on the minion. 

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)

I added some logging to `/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/modules/tuned.py`

```
    # turn off all profiles
    result = __salt__['cmd.run']('tuned-adm active')
    log.warning("result: {}".format(result))
    pattern = re.compile(r'''(?P<stmt>current active profile:) (?P<profile>\w+.*)''')
    match = re.match(pattern, result)
    log.warning("match: {}".format(match))
    return '{0}'.format(match.group('profile'))
```

Here's a snippet from the logs above:
[ERROR   ] Command 'tuned-adm active' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: No current active profile.
[WARNING ] result: No current active profile.
[WARNING ] match: None

Returning early when `tuned-adm active` fails may be the simplest solution.
