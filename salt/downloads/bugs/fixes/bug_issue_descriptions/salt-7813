Hi,

upgraded from 0.16.4. to 0.17.0 and got this on a x86_64 Amazon Linux:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state pkg.installed for jre.i586
Loaded plugins: priorities, update-motd, upgrade-helper, versionlock
Loaded plugins: priorities, update-motd, upgrade-helper, versionlock
652 packages excluded due to repository priority protections
[ERROR   ] The following package(s) were not found, and no possible matches were found in the package db: jre.i586
```

yum -y install jre.i586 works just fine.
