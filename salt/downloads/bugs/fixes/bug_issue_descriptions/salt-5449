Version: 0.15.1 (seen on 0.15.3 too)
OS: Fedora 18

The content of the file_roots master option is replaced by the content of pillar_roots, example:

(master conf)
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/states

pillar_roots:
  base1:
    - /srv/salt/pillar

And when running "salt '*' pillar.data" I can see that file_roots contains:
file_roots:
  base1:
    - /srv/salt/pillar

Expected:
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/states

This is (for me at least) preventing the minions to fetch the .sls and other files from the states dir, because it tries to fetch them from the pillar dir instead.
