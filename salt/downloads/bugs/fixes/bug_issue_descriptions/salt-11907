I have some OpenIndiana (Solaris) and it looks like they aren't recognized by the service module - probably the smf module. I think this is because the `os_family` returns `OpenIndianaDevelopment` instead of `Solaris`

OpenIndiana host:

```
root@ranger:~# salt-call grains.get os_family
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/zfs help || :' in directory '/root'
local:
    OpenIndianaDevelopment

root@ranger:~# salt-call service.status network/ntp
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/zfs help || :' in directory '/root'
Function service.status is not available
```

OmniOS host:

```
root@brigade:~# salt-call grains.get os_family
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/zfs help || :' in directory '/root'
local:
    Solaris

root@brigade:~# salt-call service.status network/ntp
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/sbin/zfs help || :' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command '/usr/bin/svcs -H -o STATE network/ntp' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] output: online
local:
    True
```
