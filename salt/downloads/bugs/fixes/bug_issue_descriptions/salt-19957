**Setup:**
1. Master of master controlling multiple syndics.
2. Multiple salt masters with syndic installed and pointing to the master of masters.
3. Each syndic has the minion connected to the master of masters.

**How to reproduce:**
- Stop the salt-syndic service.
- The service does not stop and a strace will show:

``` bash
  poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}, {fd=22, events=POLLIN}], 2, 0) = 0 (Timeout)
  poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
  poll([{fd=22, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3952, 273992175}) = 0
  poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}, {fd=22, events=POLLIN}], 2, 1000) = 0 (Timeout)
  poll([{fd=17, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
  poll([{fd=22, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0)    = 0 (Timeout)
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {3953, 275512367}) = 0
  gettimeofday({1421939537, 10546}, NULL) = 0
```
- Restart the syndic service and you will end up with 2 services which will result in doubling the test.ping result. Restart the service again and you will have 3 instances..
