### Description of Issue/Question

After update to 2016.3.3 my custom runner failed to execute some script* (using `cmd.run` through `LocalClient.cmd` ) with `svn` because `HOME` apparently is set to `/` instead of `/root` for some reason, so `svn` could not  find .`svn` directory with respective settings. And it's actually the same with `salt minion cmd.run`. 

There where no problems with 2016.3.1, and I even didn't had to set `clean_env=False` or fiddled with `env` in LocalClient.cmd arguments or anything like that. So in my case, it looks like regression of some sort.
### Setup

Two Debian Wheezy machines, master and minion with Salt 2016.3.3.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

On remote minion terminal, if I use _salt-call_ as `salt-call cmd.run env | grep HOME` **it works**, I get:

```
HOME=/root
```

But, if I execute command through the master, remotely:
`salt myminion cmd.run env | grep HOME`
I get:
`HOME=/`

Same with `clean_env=False` and with `clean_env=False python_shell=False`

It worked OK before upgrading from 2016.3.1 to 2016.3.3
