I'm trying to look into an issue we have with minions not returning, on my journey i've noted this so far. 
We run a single salt master with around 800 nodes. I've noted we see large volumes of messages along the following lines : 

2014-09-01 14:36:41,729 [salt.master                                 ][INFO    ] Clear payload received with command _auth
2014-09-01 14:36:41,729 [salt.master                                 ][INFO    ] Authentication request from gueblampdb02.skybet.net
2014-09-01 14:36:41,734 [salt.master                                 ][INFO    ] Authentication accepted from gueblampdb02.skybet.net

Now i've looked today and thus far i see this sequence occur around 50 times, i often also see duplicate entries. For instance if we restart our master i see up to 10 instances of this occur for a single node, all within a second or so. 

What does this log line mean?, is there some kind of key regeneration going on? If so, can we configure the interval? I'm worried this could be causing load issues on the salt master, hence the ticket.
