When attempting to install packages, if any error occurs during the post installation script, salt is not able to capture the output and present it in the comment's field. Instead, a simpler message is shown.

Below is an approximation for a reproducible test case. Notice that the '{{ var }}' tokens are not supposed to be rendered by jinja. They should be interpreted as literals so that the elasticsearch postinst script attempts to "addgroup {{ group }}", resulting in this error:

```
addgroup: Please enter a username matching the regular expression configured
via the NAME_REGEX configuration variable.  Use the `--force-badname'
option to relax this check or reconfigure NAME_REGEX.
dpkg: error processing elasticsearch (--install):
