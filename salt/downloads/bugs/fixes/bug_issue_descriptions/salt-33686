### Description of Issue/Question

When using blockreplace with single-line of `content`, `marker_end` is not placed on newline. Also, `marker_end` is matched without matching whole line it seems. Workaround is to not place content in salt state yaml on same line, but use `|` to place content on next line, so:

doesn't work, newline not added after content:

```
- content: "tags: test"
```

works as expected:

```
- content: |
    tags: test
```
### Setup

ubuntu 14.04
salt master/minion 2015.8.10
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

**Create existing file on system with something in it:**

```
root@server:~# cat /root/test.txt
i'm typing some things
# comment out some things

# my last line of file
```

**Make a simple blockreplace state in salt master something.sls:**

```
/root/test.txt:
  file.blockreplace:
    - marker_start: "# start here"
    - marker_end: "# end here"
    - append_if_not_found: True
    - content: "tags: test"
```

**Apply it once:**
salt 'server*' state.apply
returned:

```

                  +tags: test+# end here
```

**Notice the funky last line. No newline after `content` and before `marker_end`. The file indeed looks like this:**

```
i'm typing some things
# comment out some things

# my last line of file
# start here
tags: test
tags: test# end here
```

Now run highstate again, without changes:
Return:

                   tags: test# end here
```

**Notice it adds the `content` again, but still recognizes the `marker_end` even though it doesn't match the exact line (like docs says it should).**

**Future state.apply will change nothing**
### Workaround

use `|` after content item and place text on newline like so:

```
/root/test.txt:
  file.blockreplace:
    - marker_start: "# start here"
    - marker_end: "# end here"
    - append_if_not_found: True
    - content: |
        tags: test
```
