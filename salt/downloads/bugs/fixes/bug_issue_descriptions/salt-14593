I've managed to get salt-cloud to spin up Windows Server 2012 R2 images in Azure, and after the image spin up, winexe is used to bootstrap salt by instaling v2014.1.7 (64 bit) minion. Things work nicely when I spin up one image with the a command like this:

```
salt-cloud -p win2012r2 tst-eu-mine
```

Once the image has booted I am able to send a test.ping to it and get a response. However if I use a map file which looks like this:

```
win2012r2:
  - tst-eu-web-01
  - tst-eu-wrk-01
  - tst-eu-ony-01
  - tst-eu-dbon1
  - tst-eu-dbsta1
  - tst-eu-dbrs1
  - tst-eu-dbony1
```

and execute it with the following command:

```
salt-cloud -m ./readsoft-salt-cloud/config/cloud.maps.d/readsoft.online.minimal.setup -P
```

I get the following errors in the minion logs.

```
2014-07-29 08:07:14,458 [salt             ][INFO    ] Setting up the Salt Minion "tst-eu-dbon1"
2014-07-29 08:07:16,972 [salt.crypt       ][CRITICAL] The specified fingerprint in the master configuration file:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Does not match the authenticating master's key:
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Verify that the configured fingerprint matches the fingerprint of the correct master and that this minion is not subject to a man in the middle attack
```

Running the map file without the parallell (-P) option didn't help either. Using map files seems broken with windows minion bootstrapping.
