### Description of Issue/Question
In most of the boto_vpc modules the name option has to be globally unique.    For example the salt.states.boto_vpc.route_table_present state requires the VPC name that a routing table will be put in, but when the state checks for the existence of that state it is not VPC specific.  

Since the VPC is specified in the state, people will probably assume that the name only needs to be unique inside the VPC.  But that is not the case.  

So either the state should filter for both name and VPC Name when checking for existence, or documentation should be updated to indicate the need for uniqueness.


### Setup
Creating two routing tables in different VPCs with the same name.

```
boto_vpcProdEast5_my_route_table:
  boto_vpc.route_table_present:
    - name: my_route_table
    - vpc_name: vpcProdEast5
    - key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - keyid: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - region: us-east-2

boto_vpcProdEast6_my_route_table:
  boto_vpc.route_table_present:
    - name: my_route_table
    - vpc_name: vpcProdEast6
    - key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - keyid: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    - region: us-east-2
```
Results in only the first being created
```

          ID: boto_vpcProdEast5_my_route_table
    Function: boto_vpc.route_table_present
        Name: my_route_table
      Result: True

              old:
                  ----------
                  route_table:
                      None
----------
          ID: boto_vpcProdEast6_my_route_table
    Function: boto_vpc.route_table_present
        Name: my_route_table
      Result: True
     Comment: Route table my_route_table (rtb-1224827b) present.

```

Note the second does not get created because the first exists ( routing table ID matches)

boto_vpc.route_table_present eventuall calls _find_resources in modules/boto_vpc.py.   _find_resources is only using the name tag to filter the list of routing tables.
