salt-ssh fails when running with a "minion" that has a space in its password:

root@unstable-master:/usr/share/pyshared/salt/client/ssh# salt-ssh '*' -r 'ifconfig'
    sshpass: Failed to run command: No such file or directory

changing the password makes it happy - may also be able to quote it in some way, but it should work simply
