The somewhat undocumented feature of returning a tuple from the `__virtual__` function in modules describing why the module could not be loaded causes error logging even if the module was not going to be used. I'm not sure how widely this feature is used, but at least the new ipmi and nacl modules use it, and cause error logging on develop.
