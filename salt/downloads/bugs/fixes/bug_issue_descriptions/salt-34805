### Description of Issue/Question

When run `salt '*' disk.usage`, the above exception is thrown.

```
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1200, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/disk.py", line 91, in usage
        while not comps[1].isdigit():
    IndexError: list index out of range
```

After a sanity check of my `df` command output, I sense that there is a "mal-formatted" line in the output, as:
"df: '/mnt/hgfs': Protocol error"

Even though this is a problem on my side, a better approach should be the code to deal with this kind of situation more elegantly?
Say, still giving output but state there is a error?
