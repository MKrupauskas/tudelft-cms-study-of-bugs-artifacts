Could someone please verify that execution modules are not available in returners that will be called by scheduled execution modules?

```
schedule:
  monitor_test_ping:
    function: test.ping
    seconds: 60
    returner: <yourreturner>
```

I get a KeyError, and after inspecting **salt** I can't find the required execution module. Everything works fine when the returner will be called after an execution module run from salt cli tool (master) or salt-call (local minion).
