**Description**

Unable to apply mariaDB's [`REPLICA MONITOR` privilege](https://mariadb.com/docs/reference/mdb/privileges/REPLICA_MONITOR/) with mysql_grants state.

known/authorized grants are hardcoded in source code [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L82-L129) and `REPLICA MONITOR` grant is not present so it is impossible to add that grant as per https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/mysql.py#L2258-L2259

**Setup**

Salt 3003 under Debian 11 Bullseye with MariaDB 10.5 as shipped with debian 11

state:
```
mariadb:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - mariadb-server
      - mariadb-client
      - python3-mysqldb
   
mariadb_monitoring_user:
  mysql_user.present:
    - name: monitoring
    - host: localhost
    - password: 'S3cr3tP@ssw0rd'
    - require:
      - pkg: mariadb
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: PROCESS,REPLICA MONITOR,SHOW DATABASES,SHOW VIEW
    - database: "*.*"
    - user: monitoring
    - require:
      - mysql_user: mariadb_monitoring_user
```
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

apply state and see mysql grant failing

**Expected behavior**

grant is applied

**Additional context**

Starting from mariaDB 10.5 [`REPLICATION CLIENT` privilege](https://mariadb.com/docs/reference/mdb/privileges/REPLICATION_CLIENT/) changed capabilities and new [`REPLICA MONITOR` privilege](https://mariadb.com/docs/reference/mdb/privileges/REPLICA_MONITOR/) has been added in mariadb, so to achieve same functionnality as `REPLICATION CLIENT` in mariaDB <= 10.4 one should now use the new `REPLICA MONITOR` privilege.
