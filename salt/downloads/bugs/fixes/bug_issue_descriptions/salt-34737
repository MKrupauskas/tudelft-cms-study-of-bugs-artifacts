### Description of Issue/Question

I am managing a piwik instance configuration file with ini.options_present as I only want to touch a few settings in the file. In salt releases prior to 2016.3, this worked just fine but it seems that 2016.3 started collapsing key/values in sections that should be untouched by the state as described in the documentation https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.ini_manage.html#salt.states.ini_manage.options_present
### Setup

To reproduce, dump a file in `/tmp/test.ini` that contains:

``` ini
[somesection]
table[]="entry1"
table[]="entry2"
table[]="entry9"
```

now run:

```
# salt-call state.high '{"test": {"ini": ["options_present", {"name": "/tmp/test.ini", "sections": {"section": {"mysaltkey": "mysaltvalue"}}}]}}'
local:
    ----------
    ini_|-test_|-/tmp/test.ini_|-options_present:
        ----------
        __id__:
            test
        __run_num__:
            0
        changes:
            ----------
        comment:
            Changes take effect
        duration:
            1.566
        name:
            /tmp/test.ini
        result:
            True
        start_time:
            16:30:28.735720
```

The result file is:

``` ini
[somesection]
table[] = "entry9"

[section]
mysaltkey = mysaltvalue
```

The problem is that using these key/values is legit afaik and allows piwik to list its plugins in its configuration file. Obviously it works not so good when only one plugin is left active.
