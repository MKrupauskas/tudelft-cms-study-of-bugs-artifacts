### Description of Issue/Question
When using the vmware salt-cloud driver it's not possible to specify the locale when making the connection to vmware. When connecting to an instance of vmware that's running with a non-english locale it causes parsing problems with salt-cloud

### Setup
Install salt-cloud and configure it to talk to VMware running under a non-english locale

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run any salt-cloud command under the above conditions

### Versions Report
Salt 2016.3.3

A workaround for the moment is to make a small change to the pyVmomi connection login command to pass in the `en` locale.
In the pyVmomi 6.5 release modify the line found here in `pyVim/connect.py`: https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi/blob/v6.5.0/pyVim/connect.py#L382

Change:
```
 x = content.sessionManager.Login(user, pwd, None)
```
to
```
 x = content.sessionManager.Login(user, pwd, 'en')
```

This issue is a placeholder until a proper fix can be made upstream.
