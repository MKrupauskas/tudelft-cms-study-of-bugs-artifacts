Hi,

I am currently using the lvm module in a few states files throught the use of lvm.lv_present.

I noticed the following behavior on my states:
-> when launched localy, through salt-call, the lvdisplay command is working fine
-> when launched remotely it fails

To dig a bit further, I ran the following test case around the lvdisplay command
and I found a workaround. Set the stdin to /dev/null

QUESTION: I am currently wondering the right way to fix that bug. Be specific on the lvm module or set it directly in the cmdmod module ... This may need further investigation ? Your thought ? Is there a global file descriptor issue ?

KO Test case : 

```
[brin_f@xxxx ]$ sudo salt 'remote' cmd.run 'lvdisplay -c /dev/vg_sys/lv_ullink'
sdl-ullnk-101:
      stdin: fdopen failed: Invalid argument
      stdin: fclose failed: Invalid argument
      stdin: fdopen failed: Invalid argument
```

OK test case:

```
[brin_f@xxxxx]$ sudo salt 'remote' cmd.run 'lvdisplay -c /dev/vg_sys/lv_ullink' stdin=/dev/null
remote:
      '/dev/vg_sys/lv_ullink:vg_sys:3:1:-1:1:125829120:1920:-1:0:-1:253:5'
```
