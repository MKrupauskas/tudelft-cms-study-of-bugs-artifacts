If I have this in my `/etc/salt/grains` file:

```
roles:
  - web
  - foo
```

and I run this command:

```
salt -C 'G@roles:web' test.ping
```

salt will not send out any test ping because it can't handle matching against one item (the `web` data in the `roles` grain) in a list.

Rather, it can only do single items currently. So, if I have this instead:

```
role: web
```

Then, this command will actually ping the agent with the above grain:

```
salt -C 'G@role:web' test.ping
```

Currently, item [4.2.3 of the docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/grains.html#grains-in-etc-salt-grains) seems to imply (with its `roles:` grain in the listing) that a matcher exists which allows the user to match against an item in a grain list, such as the list of multiple roles in the listing.

This is not the case, but I'd like it to be. Could I ask that we make it possible to match against an item in a grain list? It would be really neat if I could do role-based highstate application, while also allowing my minions to take on multiple roles.
