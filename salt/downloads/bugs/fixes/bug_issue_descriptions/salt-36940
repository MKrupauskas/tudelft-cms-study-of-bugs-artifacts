### Description of Issue/Question

I am trying to run `salt <target> state.highstate` but I get the error "Salt request timed out. The master is not responding. If this error persists after verifying the master is up, worker_threads may need to be increased. " or "Minion did not return. [No response]". We have worker_threads the default value (5).

We are running 15 salt-minion EC2 instances with a salt-master running on t2.medium EC2 instance.
I tried restarting the salt-master service but I still receive this error. When I run command `salt '*' test.ping` only some of the minions return, the others return the error above (No response), and never the same minions fail to reply on consecutive calls. Even after I connect to the minion and restart the service, test.ping returns "Minion did not return. [No response]".

When I do manage to run state.highstate the return is 

```
 The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
