### Description of Issue/Question
State module file.append with makedirs=True creates directories on test=True
Would expect nothing to change on a test=True.

Somewhat related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/39951

### Setup
Trying to append to a file which does not exist.
This becomes an issue in a larger state where the preceding step creates the directory and file and you run test=True on the whole.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```bash
# Make sure the directory is gone
rm -rf /tmp/foo

# Run the state with makedirs and test=True
salt-call state.single file.append /tmp/foo/bar text="bar" makedirs=True test=True

# The directory is created
ls -ld /tmp/foo
```
