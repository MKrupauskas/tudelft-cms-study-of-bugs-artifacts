### Description of Issue/Question

If the user's primary group doesn't have a name (only a gid), a CRITICAL message is created.

### Setup
Followed [Installing Salt for Development](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/hacking.html) instructions on my MacBook Pro (macOS 10.13.3). 

My user's primary group has a gid, but no name (some side effect of my employer's OS management process).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run `salt-master` or `salt-minion` . Get a CRITICAL message with following traceback as below...

```
[CRITICAL] Failed to load grains defined in grain file minion_process.grains in function <function grains at 0x107650ed8>, error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/steinhof/src/salt/salt/loader.py", line 756, in grains
    ret = funcs[key]()
  File "/Users/steinhof/src/salt/salt/grains/minion_process.py", line 74, in grains
    'groupname': _groupname(),
  File "/Users/steinhof/src/salt/salt/grains/minion_process.py", line 60, in _groupname
    groupname = grp.getgrgid(os.getgid()).gr_name
KeyError: 'getgrgid(): gid not found: 123'
```
