### Description of Issue/Question
If a managed virtualenv sets env_vars those variables are hold in the salt-minion process. The problem is if those env_vars aren't cleaned up, they remain in the process and affect further highstate execution.

E.g. after `virtualenv.managed`  execution with setting env_vars http_proxy & https_proxy other states fail because those try to download packages through proxy (but os package repository is accessible directly and not accessible through proxy).

Those env_vars must be set too because the `- proxy` option is only passed to pip install and not passed to easy_install.

Same problem with `pip.installed`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use this state to verify the problem:

```
### env variables are unset
envvars:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo $http_proxy

envvars2:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo $https_proxy

### install virtualenv
test_venv:
  virtualenv.managed:
    - name: /usr/local/test-env
    - system_site_packages: False
    - pip_upgrade: True
    - proxy: http://myproxy.internal:3128
    - env_vars:
        http_proxy: 'http://myproxy.internal:3128'
        https_proxy: 'https://myproxy.internal:3128'
    - requirements: salt://{{ slspath }}/files/requirements.txt


### env variables are set
envvars3:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo $http_proxy

envvars4:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo $https_proxy
```
