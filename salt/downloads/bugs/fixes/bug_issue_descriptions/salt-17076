## Description

Sometimes the saltmaster fails to apply the specified environment inheritance pattern.
## Error

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'prototypes.email-service-queue' in env 'local'
```
## Setup

I use a grain called prototypes which specifies our minion's roles. I have 3 environments whose roots inherit from each other like so (Note that dev and local pillars intentionally do not inherit production):

```
file_roots:
  production:
    - /srv/salt/production
  development:
    - /srv/salt/development
    - /srv/salt/production
  local:
    - /srv/salt/local
    - /srv/salt/development
    - /srv/salt/production

pillar_roots:
  production:
    - /srv/pillar/production
  development:
    - /srv/pillar/development
  local:
    - /srv/pillar/local
    - /srv/pillar/development
```

I created 3 new minions, all with the same if "nick-carenza.local" (the environment is determined by the suffix of the minon_id). Each minion pointed to the same salmaster and these are their minion files:
- minion 1

```
master: saltmaster.dev
grains:
  prototypes:
    - email-service-api
```
- minion 2

```
master: saltmaster.dev
grains:
  prototypes:
    - email-service-mysql
```
- minion 3

```
master: saltmaster.dev
grains:
  prototypes:
    - email-service-queue
```

I created an init.sls file on the saltmaster under the production file_root for each of them. If anyone thinks the contents of those file might be significant, I may post them). I also created empty init.sls files for each prototype under the development and production pillar roots.

```
$ find . -ipath '*email-service-*' -iname init.sls
./pillar/development/prototypes/email-service-api/init.sls
./pillar/development/prototypes/email-service-mysql/init.sls
./pillar/development/prototypes/email-service-queue/init.sls
./pillar/production/prototypes/email-service-api/init.sls
./pillar/production/prototypes/email-service-mysql/init.sls
./pillar/production/prototypes/email-service-queue/init.sls
./salt/production/prototypes/email-service-api/init.sls
./salt/production/prototypes/email-service-mysql/init.sls
./salt/production/prototypes/email-service-queue/init.sls
```

When I called highstate on each of the machines and only the email-service-queue machine failed and I cannot figure out why.
