I am getting random failures when trying to apply a lot of firewall rules via Salt. The error is as follows:

```
Another app is currently holding the xtables lock. Perhaps you want to use the -w option?
```

The correct way to handle this would probably be to use the `-w` option to wait for the lock in the `iptables` Salt module.
