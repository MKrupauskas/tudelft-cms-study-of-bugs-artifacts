I want to use salt as a cloud controller for proxmox. I wanted to view storage options before creating a VM from an image. I am able to view images and run a query, but any commands that actually "do" things dont' work.

For instance:

The following exception was thrown when trying to run the initial deployment:

```

I tried looking at storage options, since I was seeing "KeyError: 'disk'", but even viewing storage doesn't work.

```

Error: There was an error running the function: The 'proxmox' cloud provider alias, for the 'proxmox' driver, does not define the function 'show_storage'
```

The error above occurs with various other commands, for instance, "Error: There was an error running the function: The 'proxmox' cloud provider alias, for the 'proxmox' driver, does not define the function 'disk'". 

Is it looking for a "show_storage" or a "disk" command in my cloud profile configuration file?

Here are the contents of my cloud.providers and cloud.profiles .conf files

```
/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/proxmox.conf
proxmox:
    provider: proxmox
    image: /volumes/pool2/ISOs/suse-13.2-x86_64.tar.gz

proxmox:

  #
#  minion:

  # Set the PROXMOX access credentials (see below)
  #
  user: root@pam
  password: supersecret

  # Set the access URL for your PROXMOX provider

```

It was suggested that I ping @syphernl on this issue.
