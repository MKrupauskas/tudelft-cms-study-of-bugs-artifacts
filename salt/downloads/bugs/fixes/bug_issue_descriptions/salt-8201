I discovered this with my development VM today. This is actually a bug in the yum python API, where `yum.YumBase.processTransaction()` proceeds with the transaction even when there were errors. Scarier still, it adds the packages which require the package you are trying to remove to the transaction. So, run `pkg.remove python` and yum, rpm, etc. are all removed and your minion is toast.

I've got a fix for this mostly done.
