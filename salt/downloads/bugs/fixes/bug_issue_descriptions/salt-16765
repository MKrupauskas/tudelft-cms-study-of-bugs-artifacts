We've had developers wanting to use OS X Yosemite but our salt states haven't been working on that OS. The core error seems to be from the user.list_groups state. Here is the output (curious that Mavericks seems to have other problems going on but seem to be working):

Yosemite

$ sudo salt-call user.list_groups 
Function user.list_groups is not available

Mavericks

$ sudo salt-call user.list_groups mattwinchester
