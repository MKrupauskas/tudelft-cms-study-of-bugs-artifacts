my server is on debian jessie with last released package : 2015.8.8.2
I upgrade one minion windows for this test, I don't think it is an issue.

I would like to use win_pkg.install behind an http proxy, it doesn't work on 2015.8 so I would try the new option that is in 2016.3.

I configure proxy_host: and proxy_port: in minion conf file (no need username and pass) 

and I have this error : 
MinionError: Error: proxy_host and proxy_port has been set. This requires pycurl, but the pycurl library does not seem to be installed reading http://www.uvnc.eu/download/1205/UltraVNC_1_2_05_X64_Setup.exe

maybe it would be a good Idea to package pycurl in msi ?
