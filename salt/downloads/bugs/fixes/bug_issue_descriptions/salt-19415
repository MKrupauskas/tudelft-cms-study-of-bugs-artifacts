Salt does not appear to be properly recognizing when there are lines in a sources.list or sources.list.d/\* file that have been commented out.

After running do-release-upgrade from Ubuntu 12 to 14, our clients had their Java webupd8 ppas disabled (see output below)

I assumed that Salt would see that these are disabled and re-add them when executing the following state:

```
pkgrepo.managed:
        - humanname: WebUpd8 Oracle Java PPA repository
        - ppa: webupd8team/java
```

But it actually did not recognize that the bolded lines below were commented, and passed through the state without doing anything.

Then when I went to install java, the package was not found.

```
root@vwc-es115:~# grep ^ /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* | grep java
