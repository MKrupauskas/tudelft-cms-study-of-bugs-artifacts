Hi, 
Consider following state file `random_tests/populate_hosts.sls`

``` yaml
populate_file_with_blocks:
  file:
    - blockreplace
    - name: /tmp/testfile
    - marker_start: '#== START ==#'
    - marker_end: '#== END ==#'
    - illegal_function_arg: |
          xx.xx.xx.xx     somerandomhost
    - append_if_not_found: True
    - show_changes: True
```

Above file must produce an error either in logs or in console output. But it does not. It does append markers in file `/tmp/testfile`

Following command was run

``` bash
salt -E 'somehost' state.sls random_tests.populate_hosts saltenv=mydc -t 5000
```

Following is the output:

``` yaml
somehost:
----------
          ID: populate_file_with_blocks
    Function: file.blockreplace
        Name: /tmp/testfile
      Result: True

```

Contents of file:

``` bash
#== START ==#

#== END ==#
```

I mistakenly typed `content`  as `contents`. (notice s after content) and without any errors , it was difficuilt and time consuming to spot typo.
