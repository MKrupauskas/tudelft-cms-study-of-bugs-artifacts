My previously working states fail to run when upgrading from 2014.7.2 to 2014.7.4.  The issue I'm seeing is that the `source` filed for `file.managed` _must_ be a single item, rather than a list of one or more items.

From the docs:

http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.managed

> A list of sources can also be passed in to provide a default source and a set of fallbacks. The first source in the list that is found to exist will be used and subsequent entries in the list will be ignored.

The following works:

```
rsyslog:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/rsyslog.conf
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644 
    - source: salt://rsyslog/files/rsyslog.conf
    - require:
      - pkg: rsyslog
```

However, this fails:

```
rsyslog:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/rsyslog.conf
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644
    - source:
      - salt://rsyslog/files/rsyslog.conf.{{ grains['fqdn'] }}
      - salt://rsyslog/files/rsyslog.conf.{{ grains['instance_type'] }}
      - salt://rsyslog/files/rsyslog.conf
    - require:
      - pkg: rsyslog
```

Changing to a single-item list still fails:

```
    - source:
      - salt://rsyslog/files/rsyslog.conf
```

Whether `source` has one item in the list or multiple, the error returned is:

"Comment: Unable to manage file: none of the specified sources were found"

As soon as I switch to the `source: salt://...` syntax, it works as expected.
