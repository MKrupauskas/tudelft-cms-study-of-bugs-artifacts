Although it's shown in debug log level, but should tracebacks be displayed at all? Instead of displaying a traceback, displaying a formatted message like the following would look better

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to import states pyrax_queues, this is most likely NOT a problem
[DEBUG   ] No module named pyrax
```

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to import states pyrax_queues, this is most likely NOT a problem:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 911, in load_modules
    ), fn_, path, desc

    import salt.utils.openstack.pyrax as suop

```
