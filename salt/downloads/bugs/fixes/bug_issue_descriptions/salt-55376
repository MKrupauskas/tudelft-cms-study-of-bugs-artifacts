### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->
When creating a user with Salt in RabbitMQ 3.8.0 I receive the following error:

```
2019-11-20 10:56:30,492 [salt.state       :322 ][ERROR   ][28696] Error: RabbitMQ command failed: Error:
{:undef, [{:rabbit_auth_backend_internal, :check_user_login, ["admin", [password: "adminPassword1"]], []}, {:erl_eval, :do_apply, 6, [file: 'erl_eval.erl', line: 680]}, {:rpc, :"-handle_call_call/6-fun-0-", 5, [file: 'rpc.erl', line: 197]}]}
```

This issue is partly because `rabbit_auth_backend` was renamed in 3.5.7 but it is being used in 3.8 because of an output format change.

The test for version is here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py#L459 (But it fails for 3.8)


This looks like one of the problems, as the format of `rabbitmqctl status` changed in 3.8 so this regex no longer works:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py#L445

And it falls back to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/modules/rabbitmq.py#L486

Rabbitmq Status before 3.8
```
$ rabbitmqctl status
[{pid,305}, {running_applications,
    [{rabbit,"RabbitMQ","3.7.21"},
```

RabbitMQ status in 3.8
```
$ rabbitmqctl status
Status of node rabbit ...
Runtime

OS PID: 4712
OS: Linux
Uptime (seconds): 3294202
RabbitMQ version: 3.8.0
Node name: rabbit@dev-g-rbt1-01
Erlang configuration: Erlang/OTP 22 [erts-10.5.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [ds:2:2:10] [async-threads:64] [hipe]
Erlang processes: 539 used, 1048576 limit
Scheduler run queue: 1
Cluster heartbeat timeout (net_ticktime): 60
```

One thing that works is:
```
rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_access_control:check_user_login(<<"admin">>, [{password, <<"adminPassword1">>}]).'
```

### Setup

```sls
rabbitadminUser:
  rabbitmq_user.present:
    - name: admin
    - password: "adminPassword1"
    - tags:
      - administrator
    - perms:
      - '/':
        - ".*"
        - ".*"
        - ".*"
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Run a RabbitMQ 3.8 and try to create a user with Salt RabbitMQ user provider.
