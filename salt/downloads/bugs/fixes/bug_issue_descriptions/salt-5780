With installing the latest git version of salt stack, I always get the following error when using the 'pkg' state:

```
    State: - pkg
     Name:      nginx
     Function:  installed
         Result:    False
         Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call      last):
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1238, in call
     *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/pkg.py", line 376, in installed
     if salt.utils.is_true(refresh) or os.path.isfile(rtag):
 NameError: global name 'rtag' is not defined
```

It doesn't matter what package, or how many... I always get this error.
If I install the package repository version, this error disappears.
