If you do a "watch_in" for an ID that doesn't exist, then you get an error message of the form: Cannot extend ID {0} in "{1}:{2}". It is not part of the high state.

The actual error is that you have messed up the requisite, but this message doesn't help you fix it. You can reproduce this with a state that does something like this:

```
/etc/foo:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://foo
    - watch_in:
      - service: bar
```

If there is no service with ID "bar", you will get this error.
