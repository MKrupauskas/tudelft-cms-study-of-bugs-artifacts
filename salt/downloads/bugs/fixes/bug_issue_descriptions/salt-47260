### Description of Issue/Question
I can't seem to get the disable_saltenv_mapping feature working on my master. When I add in that line, I'm never able to list the files on the master.
### Setup
Here's the relevant part of my config:

    fileserver_backend:
      - roots
      - gitfs

    file_roots:
      base:
        - /srv/salt

    gitfs_remotes:
      - git://my.git.repo/git/repo:
        - root: salt
        - base: master
    #    - disable_saltenv_mapping: True

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I do a `salt-run fileserver.file_list` and it lists all my files. If I remove that comment character, then delete the cache `rm -rf /var/cache/salt/`, restart the master `service salt-master restart`, and start listing files again, I don't get anything from my git repo. Add the comment back, and everything (slowly) starts to work again.

### Versions Report
