OS - CentOS 6.4
Salt - EPEL 6 - 0.15.3

I have a situation where whenever I update httpd on server with a very custom app, I need to run salt-call state.highstate to restore some nonstandard permissions.  This is the YAML that keeps the permissions:

```
{% for path in '/var/www', '/var/www/cgi-bin' %}
{{ path }}:
  file.directory:
    - user: webuserguy
    - group: webgroup
    - mode: '2755'
    - require:
      - user: webuserguy
      - pkg: httpd
{% endfor %}
```

When I run salt-call state.highstate test=True, it doesn't report these changes will be made, but when I run without test=True, it makes the changes.

```
State: - file
Name:      /var/www/cgi-bin
Function:  directory
    Result:    True
    Comment:   Directory /var/www/cgi-bin updated
    Changes:   group: webgroup
               mode: 2755
               user: webuserguy
```

```
State: - file
Name:      /var/www
Function:  directory
    Result:    True
    Comment:   Directory /var/www updated
    Changes:   group: webgroup
               mode: 2755
               user: webuserguy
```

My first guess is the mode that is tripping it up.  We have to keep it 2755 so any new files created have the same ownership as the directory.

Thanks!
