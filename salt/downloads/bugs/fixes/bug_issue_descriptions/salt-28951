```

Packages install and services restart failed on this system.
I had to edit the minion code in order to get things running.

```
grep -nr CloudLinux * | grep -v softlayer
grains/core.py:846:    'cloudserve': 'CloudLinux',
grains/core.py:862:    'CloudLinux': 'RedHat',
modules/rh_service.py:50:        'CloudLinux',
modules/service.py:31:        'CloudLinux',
```

I replaced all `CloudLinux` entries with `Cloud`, this fixed things for me.
I will not make a pull request with this change since it is a trivial one and I don't think this is the correct fix.
