Version >=2014.7.1

file.managed's contents_pillar: expects the name of a pillar that is a flat string on the RH side

If you try to hand over a list instead, an exception is throws which is hard to debug / not very user friendly.

Instead a proper error message should be shown.

**Example state sls:**

``` yaml
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt_managed.list:
  file.managed:
    - contents_pillar: system:packages:sources
```

**Example pillar data:**

``` yaml
system:
  packages:
    sources:
      - deb line 1
      - deb line 2
```

**Exception looks like this:**

``` python
