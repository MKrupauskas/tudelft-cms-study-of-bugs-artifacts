I am seeing corrupt keys in helium for lots of minions, as evidenced in the salt-master log file:

[ERROR   ] Corrupt public key "/etc/salt/pki/master/minions/somehost.somedomain.com": no start line

Running master in open mode and attempting to delete all the corrupt keys on the minions and recreate them via the below commands to see if this clears it up.  Anyone know if this is an artefact of old hydrogen keys not playing nice with helium, or a bug with helium key handling in general?  In at least one case this appears to have crashed the master daemon.

grep Corrupt /var/log/salt/master.badkeys | awk '{print $9}' | cut -d '"' -f 2 | cut -d '/' -f 7 | sort |uniq > /tmp/corrupt-keys.txt

for n in `cat /tmp/corrupt-keys.txt`; do ssh -o BatchMode=yes  $n "/etc/init.d/salt-minion stop; rm -rf /etc/salt/minion?\* /etc/salt/pki; /etc/init.d/salt-minion restart"; done
