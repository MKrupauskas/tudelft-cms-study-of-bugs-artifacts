### Description of Issue/Question

Hi,

I'm attempting to implement the [basic use case of Thorium](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/thorium/index.html) to cleanup dead minion keys.

From a clean slate, everything works fine the first time.

However, when the master or the minion is restarted, then the minion's key is rejected soon after, with messages:

```

2017-03-08 22:52:51,755 [salt.master][WARNING ][13865] Minion id ip-10-1-22-105.ec2.internal is not who it says it is!
```

It seems related to the AES key rotation that is happening shortly before.

I would really appreciate any ideas!

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

I'm using the configuration described in the docs linked above.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

- Install master with the Thorium config described in the docs for minion cleanup
- Install minion with the Thorium config for minion cleanup
- Restart minion or master
- Wait for key to be removed
