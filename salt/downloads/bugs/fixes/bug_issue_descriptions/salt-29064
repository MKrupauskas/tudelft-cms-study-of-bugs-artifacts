I just installed the development branch of Salt on a fresh [CentOS 7 instance in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW) and I get the following error when attempting to run a simple service.running state for mariadb:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [mariadb] at time 22:19:33.890532

```

I've tested with other states and it appears to happen with all services, not just mariadb. From the looks of it the systemctl command it's using to check if the service exists is malformed and always erroring. Here is my salt version:
