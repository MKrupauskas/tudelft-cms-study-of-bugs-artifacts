**Description**

If a host or network goes away during a cloud deployment ssh connections to the box can be left in a hung state indefinitely. 


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Run 50+ deployments using the saltify cloud provider when some of the hosts might go away before the deployment finishes.

**Expected behavior**

We should add `ServerAliveInterval` and `ServerAliveCountMax` options to all connections in `salt.utils.cloud`. Add these options anywhere we are setting the `StrictHostKeyChecking` option.

Values of these options can be something like `ServerAliveInterval=10` and `ServerAliveCountMax=3` which will detect network failures and timeout after 30 seconds.

We can make these values configurable but we should at least have some sane defaults for them. Making them configurable is not necessary to close this issue.
