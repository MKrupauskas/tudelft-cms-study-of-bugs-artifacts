As discussed in #25456 installing 2015.8.0rc1 via salt-bootstrap on a stock Centos 6 fails with

```

```

As suggested by @s0undt3ch this is due to the fact that 2015.8 now requires pycrypto >=2.6. However stock Centos/RHEL 6 only comes with python-crypto-2.0.1. (Centos 7 has pycrypto 2.6 in the base repo so this shouldn't be an issue for Centos 7. Centos 5  - hmmm, good luck there!)

python-crypto2.6  is available in epel, but I couldn't get it to work out of the box due to the egg structure (sorry, I'm not a python person so I don't understand the module loading mechanism in python and/or how python rpms are meant to be packaged). To get it to work (on x64), I needed to do the following

```
yum erase -y  python-crypto
yum install -y   python-crypto2.6   # make sure epel is installed
ln -s /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/pycrypto-2.6.1-py2.6-linux-x86_64.egg/Crypto /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/
```

After that, the salt-master starts normally.
