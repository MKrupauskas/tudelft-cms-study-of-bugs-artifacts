I'm using git_pillar as external pillar. Whenever I change the pillar data to 'newvalue' and run

```
salt-call pillar.get test:value
```

it outputs

```
local:
    newvalue
```

salt-call seems to be always up-to-date related to pillar data.

But when I call

```
salt myhost pillar.get test:value
```

it still shows the old value

```
myhost:
    oldvalue
```

Removing /var/salt/cache/master and minion on all machines and restarting all services does not change this behavior.

I'm not sure if this is related to git_pillar.
