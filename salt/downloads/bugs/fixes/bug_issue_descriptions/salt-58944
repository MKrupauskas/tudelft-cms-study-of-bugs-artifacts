**Description**
When `pip.install` is called with a requirements file that has a comment that looks like a requirements link (i.e. `# via -r requirements.in, something`), and a `user` param, salt will parse the requirements file incorrectly and read the linked file as `requirementsin.in, something`.

**Setup**
To see the issue in latest salt:
 - setup a virtualenv for salt to use. (I used `/venv` in a container as the example)
 - setup a requirements file with contents: `requests  # via -r requirements.in, foo`
 - call `pip.install` with the venv, requirements file, and a local user.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Full docker example:
```
docker run -i --rm amazonlinux:2 bash - <<BASH
set -eux
cd /root
yum install -y python3-devel
python3 -m pip install virtualenv salt==3002.1
python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 /venv
echo 'requests  # via -r requirements.in, foobar' > /root/requirements.txt

salt-call --local --skip-grains pip.install requirements=/root/requirements.txt user=nobody bin_env=/venv
BASH
```
Should see a stacktrace ending with: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.in, foobar'`

**Expected behavior**
expected `pip.install` to ignore the comments in requirements.txt
