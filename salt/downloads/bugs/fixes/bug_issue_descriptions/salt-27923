This only happens if the salt-minion service is stopped when you run the installer.
This started occurring after the change in trying to preserve existing customer files and only remove salt specific stuff.
To reproduce, install any version of salt and then stop the salt-minion service. Then install 2015.8.1. It will tell you salt is already installed and prompt you to remove the current installation. The first step in removing the existing installation is to stop the salt-minion service. I'm guessing that because it's already stopped, the stop command returns an error causing the rest of the function to fail, causing the install NOT to get the settings from the config.
Look at the logic that happens when this is being loaded... maybe get those settings before salt is removed...
