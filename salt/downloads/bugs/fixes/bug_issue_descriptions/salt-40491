### Description of Issue/Question
According to [documentation](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.archive.html) _trim_output_ param should prevent _archive.extracted_ from listing ALL extracted files.
I can't get this one to work using the following example : 
```
extract_tomcat:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /******/
    - source: salt://resource/files/tomcat_8.0.35.tgz
    - user: *******
    - group: *******
    - trim_output: True
    - require:
      - archive: extract_java
```

I also tried to use a integer (10 for example), but this doesn't have any effect on the output which show ALL files being extracted.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Try the _trim_output_ in any context ....
