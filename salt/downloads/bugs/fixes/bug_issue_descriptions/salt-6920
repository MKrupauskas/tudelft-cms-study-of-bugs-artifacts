While debugging why removing a user account was failing I saw on the logs:

```
Command 'userdel -r -f issue-6912' failed with return code: 12
```

This is a bug on debian based distros(apparently), which is fixed upstream, [see here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/shadow/+bug/1023509).

Should we treat 12 as a good exit code?
Only for debian based distributions?
