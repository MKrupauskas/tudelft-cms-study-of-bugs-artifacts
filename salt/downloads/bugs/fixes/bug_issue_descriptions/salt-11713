OS: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
salt version: 2014.1.0

This is what I have in sls:

```
stuff:
  user.present:
    - shell: /bin/false
    - home: /home/stuff
    - uid: 5000
    - gid: 5000
    - system: True
    - require:
      - group: stuff
  group.present:
    - gid: 5000
    - system: True

backup_in_stuff:
  group.present:
    - name: stuff
    - gid: 5000
    - system: True
    - members:
      - backup
```

when I run state.highstate I get 

```
Result: True
Comment: No change
```

for both _group_ states, and user backup is still only in backup group only:

```
$ groups backup
backup : backup
```
