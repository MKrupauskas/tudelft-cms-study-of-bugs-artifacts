### Description of Issue/Question
The state `pkg.installed` works as expected and installs package from external source, but it returns true which prevents depending states from being executed.

This issue has just popped out on our older code base, which was not changed last days and used to work with previous releases of saltstack.

### Setup
State: 
```
jenkins:
  pkg.installed:
    - hold: True
    - sources:
      - jenkins: https://jenkins.korekontrol.net/get/package/jenkins_1.651.3_all.deb

disable-jenkins-service:
  service.dead:
    - name: jenkins
    - enable: False
    - require:
      - pkg: jenkins
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run the state as above
2. See in debug logs that package jenkins was fetched and installed correctly, but state anyway returned ERROR:
```

```

3. In salt output we see that state `jenkins` failed and other states, which depend on it, were not executed:
