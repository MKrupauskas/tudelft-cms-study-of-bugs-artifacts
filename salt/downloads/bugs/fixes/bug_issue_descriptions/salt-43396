### Description of Issue/Question
salt added support for "WILDCARD VERSIONS", but it slowed down pkg.installed state. I have identified the cause in https://github.com/terminalmage/salt/blob/da7d3ecec08a79ef95c3bf0d89ad70ef66290213/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L1215

pkg.install function started to use list_repo_pkgs in pkg_install even if no wildcards are used. I can create a pull request, but my python knowledge is very limited. I think following code could repair this issue:

`if has_wildcards:
            _available = list_repo_pkgs(*has_wildcards, byrepo=False, **kwargs)`
