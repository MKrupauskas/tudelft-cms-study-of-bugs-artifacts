When trying to start a group of servers like so:
`salt-cloud -m /srv/config/cloud.maps.d/all.map -P`
all servers fail to launch with the following output:

```
app01:
    ----------
    Message:
        Already running
```

These servers appear in the EC2 instance list, but they are in the "Terminated" state, so I see no reason why salt should consider them to be already running.
