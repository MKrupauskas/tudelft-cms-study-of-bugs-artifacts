It appears that calls to RunnerClient.async() lead a new zombie process to be created. I ran into this under several different circumstances: 1. while calling from a standalone python script caling RunnerClient.async() directly. 2. While invoking inside of a runner module. 3. While called during a peer publish event. In the last two cases this led to a zombie salt-master process to be spanned. My guess it has to do with holding onto a subprocess reference somewhere in the bowels of the async() call and not calling wait() or poll() somewhere along the line.
