I'm having a problem where the salt-virt runner runs into a timeout and is no longer able to find Hypervisors or init or purge VMs on them once they have ~30+ VMs running on them. I tried to set a higher timeout but it seems to be ignored.

I'm running 2014.1.5+ds-5trusty on Ubuntu trusty on a one node test setup.

```
root@kvm1 /srv/salt-images # salt-run virt.purge ub1404testvm1
Failed to find vm ub1404testvm1 to purge
root@kvm1 /srv/salt-images # virsh list | grep ub1404testvm1
 31    ub1404testvm1                  running
```

With debugging:

```

```

When I run `salt kvm1.hv.de1 virt.full_info` manually it returns the proper results.

I also ran into more problems with salt-virt where when creating many VMs in a loop at some point it would stop finding the Hypervisor (linked to above's problem I guess) and end up with like 10 salt-minions running in parallel on the Hypervisor. Resulting in a ton of `2014-06-24 21:13:53,802 [salt.master      ][ERROR   ] An extra return was detected from minion kvm1.hv.de1, please verify the minion, this could be a replay attack` entries in the master log.

Edit:
I just tried the for loop and forcing the use of the local Hypervisor by passing it as an argument, but again, salt-virt fails after about 30 or so VMs are being created. The Hypervisor was empty when I started the task and no second task was creating VMs in parallel or anything like that.
