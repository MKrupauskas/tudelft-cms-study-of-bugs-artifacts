### Description of Issue/Question

It seems that Salt Python API is ignoring the 'saltenv' parameter, at least for some modules, tested with 'cp' module in this case. I noticed it with `cp.get_file` but it is also reproductible with `cp.list_master_dirs` as shown below.
### Setup

salt-master and salt-minion running in a LXC instance. Mostly default configuration 
for both except few harmless tweaks such as:

salt-master:

```
worker_threads: 10
hash_type: sha384
log_file: file:///dev/log    
log_fmt_logfile: 'salt: [%(levelname)-8s] %(name)s: %(message)s'
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/Files
  admin:
    - /srv/admin/Files
```

salt-minion:

```
hash_type: sha384
log_file: file:///dev/log    
log_fmt_logfile: 'salt: [%(levelname)-8s] %(name)s: %(message)s'
```

Configuration files are in 'master.d' and 'minion.d' respectively while '/etc/salt/master' and '/etc/salt/minion' are empty files containing a single commented line (# salt)

Getting rid of the configuration files in '*/.d' directories and merging into '/etc/salt/master|minon' directly does not change anything in case the information could be relevant.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

'base' file_root contains a subdir 'foo' and 'admin' file_root contains a 'bar' subdir to show the issue.

Command line

```
# salt 'salt*' cp.list_master_dirs
salt.domain.tld:
    - .
    - foo

# salt 'salt*' cp.list_master_dirs saltenv='admin'
salt.domain.tld:
    - .
    - bar
```

Python API

``` python
>>> import salt.client
>>> a = salt.client.LocalClient()
>>> a.cmd( 'salt*', 'cp.list_master_dirs' )
{'salt.domain.tld': ['.', 'foo']}

>>> a.cmd( 'salt*', 'cp.list_master_dirs', saltenv = 'admin' )
{'salt.domain.tld': ['.', 'foo']}
```

'saltenv' parameter seems to be ignored as the result is the same.
