I'm running Salt 0.16.0-1precise from the PPA.

I tried using ec2-tags.py from @saltstack/salt-contrib . After that had synced to all the minions, they stopped responding. Any command with salt-call gave a traceback:

```
$ sudo salt-call grains.get tags

```

I had to delete the script from /var/cache/salt/minions/extmod/grains from each host with ssh before they would respond again.
