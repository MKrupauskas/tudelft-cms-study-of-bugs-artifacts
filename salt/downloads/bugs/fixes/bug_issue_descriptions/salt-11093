My environment consists of standalone-windows-minions.

> c:\salt\salt-call --version
> salt-call.exe 2014.1.0-5-g7400343

From the documentation, "password" does not appear to be supported for the user state on windows:

"password
    A password hash to set for the user. This field is only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris."

Yet, documentation concerning win_useradd states this:

 "salt.modules.win_useradd.setpassword(name, password)
    Set a user's password"

And, in order to truly add a windows user, I need to be able to include a password along with the username.  I've tried adding this parameter within the user.state like below, but am having no luck.

Is there a solution for adding users via the user state for windows like below?

```
JenkinsGroup:
  group:
   - present

sshGroup:
  group:
   - present

mletest:
  user:
    - present
    - fullname:  "mletest Account"
    - password: {{ pillar['Jauth'] }}
    - groups:
      - JenkinsGroup
      - Users
      - sshGroup
```

Thanks.
