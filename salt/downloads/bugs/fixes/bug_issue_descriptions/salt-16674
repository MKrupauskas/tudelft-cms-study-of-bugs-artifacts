As of Django `1.7`, the `syncdb` command is deprecated, and defers to the `migrate` command. The migrate command does not accept a `--migrate` flag. So what you end up having to do if you want to run migrations is to run `syncdb` with `migrate: False`.

What's the correct way to deal with different versions of tools in salt modules?
