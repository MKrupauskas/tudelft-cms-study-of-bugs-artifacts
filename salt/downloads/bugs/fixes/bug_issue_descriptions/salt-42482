So...... we upgraded the master to 2017.7 this week and deployed new versions of the salt-minion  2017.7 Py2-x86_64 to a few windows 7 machines and now unable to install patches. We can list them out just fine but installing fails, boooo.

Running:
salt <traget> win_wua.list install=True  OR  salt <target>win_wua.list_updates install=True

Fails with:   Passed invalid arguments to win_wua.list: 'int' object is not callable


I tried on multiple Windows 7 systems with no joy.  I even wiped salt-minion off a machine so we had a clean install versus an upgrade from 2016.

NOTE the "-" in the below output hint "KBs:" as that is the only difference in the output of "win_wua.list"  between the latest 2016 and 2017.7 salt-minion clients.  Could that be causing the problem??

            False            
        KBs:

        NeedsReboot:         
            False

This is so bad for patching week as we can't patch.
