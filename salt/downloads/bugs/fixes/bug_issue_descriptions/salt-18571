The new s3fs s3 cache detection mechanism no longer works.

In v2014.1.13, it correctly identifies that the cached file is good and doesn't need to re-download it from S3. It displays this using the follow log and runs very fast:

```
2014-11-29 02:10:47,973 [salt.loaded.int.fileserver.s3fs              ][INFO    ] mys3 - base : base/MyTest/myfile skipped download since cached file size equal to and mtime after s3 values
```

In v2014.7.0, this caching detection is broken. This log is no longer seen, and every request to the file served from s3fs is redownloaded all the time. This causes huge stability problems. Salt hangs often. Sometimes restarts of the master and minion don't recover it.
