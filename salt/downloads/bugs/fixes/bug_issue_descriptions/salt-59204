I have integrated vault with saltstack using the document https://help.saltstack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041140451-Quick-Guide-to-Vault-Integration

everything was good enough, but am not getting the value with `salt-run sdb.get 'sdb://myvault/salt/data/user1' -l debug`
getting error
```
ImportError: bad magic number in 'salt.loaded.int.log_handlers.fluent_mod.cpython-35': b'\x17\r\r\n'
    raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/salt/data
```

I strictly followed the document and used the same vault policies.

Still while executing in minions  getting none value

Could anyone help on this issue??

3000.3
