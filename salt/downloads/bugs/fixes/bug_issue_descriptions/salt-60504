**Description**

While debugging #59903 we discovered that `salt.utils.vt.Terminal` will sometimes hang before running the command. This problem happens when running in a multi-threaded environment. We tracked the hang down to some book keeping done by python's `os.fork` method.e

Migrate `salt.utils.vt.Terminal` use `subprocess.Popen` instead of making a call to `os.fork`. `subprocess.Popen` forks at the C level and avoids the same bookkeeping done by os.fork
