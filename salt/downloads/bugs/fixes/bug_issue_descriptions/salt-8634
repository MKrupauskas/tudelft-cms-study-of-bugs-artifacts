[Minor issue]
When using logstash_zmq_handler with logstash 1.2.2, logstash complains about deprecated settings:

You are using a deprecated config setting "charset" set in zeromq. 
You are using a deprecated config setting "format" set in zeromq. You should use the newer 'codec' setting instead.

If I try to replace "format" with "codec", logstash blows up with: 

```
Couldn't find any codec plugin named 'json_event'
```
