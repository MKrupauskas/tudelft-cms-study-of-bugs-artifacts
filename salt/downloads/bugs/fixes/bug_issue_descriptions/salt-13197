I have a state that I used to install an agent from mongodb:

```
mmsbackupagent:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - sources:
      - mongodb-mms-backup-agent: https://mms.mongodb.com/download/agent/backup/mongodb-mms-backup-agent-1.6.0.55-1.x86_64.rpm
```

The agent has since been updated so I changed the state file like so:

```
mmsbackupagent:
  pkg:
    - installed
    - sources:
      - mongodb-mms-backup-agent: https://mms.mongodb.com/download/agent/backup/mongodb-mms-backup-agent-1.6.1.87-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Running a state.highstate on the minion does not pick up the different source file:

```
----------
          ID: mmsbackupagent
    Function: pkg.installed
      Result: True
     Comment: All specified packages are already installed.
     Changes:
----------
```

Shouldn't pkg.installed pick up the version change and update the package accordingly?

Version info from master and minion:
