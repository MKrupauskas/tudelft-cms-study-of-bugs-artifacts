### Description of Issue/Question
If salt.utils.find is not going to be supported whatsoever on Windows, it needs to be declared as-such instead of just quietly removing test coverage. Alternatively (and preferably) we need a version of this utility that does work on Windows.

### Setup
Found in testing: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/43024
