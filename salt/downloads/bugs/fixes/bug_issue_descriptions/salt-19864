Hi,

I found something extremely close to what I have right now and the same problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27925274/3-level-topology-with-saltstack-salt-syndic-performs-very-slowly
1. Salt master
2. Salt master + syndic + minion
3. Sal minion

When I run test.ping from 1 (which is master of master) it returns true for all hosts but before exiting it waits around 10 more seconds.

Is there any one else with this problem? If so is some bug or something not configured correctly?
For me this started happening since I enabled: order_masters on the master of master without having the lower level master connected.
I thought it will go away after I connect a lower level master but it did not.
