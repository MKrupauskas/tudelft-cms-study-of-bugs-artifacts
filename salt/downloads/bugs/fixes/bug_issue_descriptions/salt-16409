Currently it looks like Salt just uses urllib2.  Urllib2 doesn't work well with SNI servers.

In practice, this bit us as the Docker folks started hosting their apt repository GPG key on a SNI server.

You can see this with raw python:

```
python2.7 -c "import urllib2; req = urllib2.Request('https://get.docker.com/gpg'); response = urllib2.urlopen(req); print response.read()"
```

We have worked around this with the Docker guys (https://get.docker.io doesn't use SNI) but there is a good chance it'll break again in the future.

I'm not sure how to fix this as SSL support in python has a long and painful history, but it might be worth switching to alternate download frameworks.  Or fall back on calling curl/wget in some cases?
