I had pillars set that were working, and after being forced to upgrade to the develop branch after salt-cloud was broken, they don't work anymore. I don't get any error messages, they just don't show up when I try a saltutil.refresh_pillar

```
sudo salt 'aws-instance' saltutil.refresh_pillar
aws-instance:
    None
```
