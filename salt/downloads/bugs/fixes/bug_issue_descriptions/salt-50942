### Description of Issue/Question
Functionality isn't broken, I just can't get a salt run without error count being equal to 1.

I am receiving this error on only one out of many pip packages:

```
          ID: pip-deps
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: python
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1913, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1898, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/pip_state.py", line 910, in installed
                  if pkg_name.lower() in already_installed_packages:
              AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'

### Setup
State file: 
```
pip-deps:
  pip.installed:
    - names:
      - nose
      - mock
      - redis
      - pyyaml
      - coverage
      - gitpython
      - python
      - python-redis
      - nose-exclude
```
Other packages that are already installed are returned as being installed as you can see here (compare inclusion of "coverage" and "gitpython" in pip.packages above to output below):
```
          ID: pip-deps
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: coverage
      Result: True
     Comment: Python package coverage was already installed
              All specified packages are already installed
     Started: 13:14:26.692770
    Duration: 512.597 ms
     Changes:
----------
          ID: pip-deps
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: gitpython
      Result: True
     Comment: Python package gitpython was already installed
              All specified packages are already installed
     Started: 13:14:27.205854
    Duration: 525.234 ms
     Changes:
```
But only the python package is throwing this error.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1.)  Run salt against your minion and include the pip.packages clause above, specifically "python".
2.)  Make sure your minion already has python installed (via pip):
```
[devopsuser@slave-salttesting-pja01 ~]$ pip install python
Requirement already satisfied: python in /usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-dynload
You are using pip version 9.0.3, however version 18.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.

```
My minion is a CentOS 7.4.1708 machine.
