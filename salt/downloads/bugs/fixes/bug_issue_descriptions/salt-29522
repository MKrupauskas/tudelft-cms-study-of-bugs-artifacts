Hi @all,

i'm new to salt and we evaluate at the moment the migration from ansible to salt.
So as we want to manage systems where we do not want to install the minion software and try to use salt-ssh. For simplicity we want to use the ansible hostfile but i can not get it to work.

sample ansible host file:

```
[test]
server1
server2

[broken]
server3
```

when i try to run it with the following cmd:

```
salt-ssh -l all --roster ansible --roster-file ansible_hosts '*' test.ping
```

i allways got:

```

```

I also tried instead of `'*'` the `all` keyword but i got always this error.
It seams that the roster detects the `[groups]` but could not parse the hosts.
Maybe i did something wrong?

The system where we try to run the salt-ssh ist an Debian 8.
We've used the repo.saltstack.com Repo and installed Version 2015.8.3+ds-1.
