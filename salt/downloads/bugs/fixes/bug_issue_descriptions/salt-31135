if file.line  mode=replace is confronted with an empty file, it causes an exception:

```
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1624, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1491, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)

                  for line in body.split(os.linesep)])
              TypeError: expected a character buffer object
```

If the file has one blank line, then this doesn't fail.
