**Description**
When applying a list of entities to apply to a policy, `lgpo.set` reports pending changes when `test=True` is set, whether changes are required or not.

**Setup**
Verify that the policy "Take ownership of files or other objects" is in its default state - only the Administrators group should be returned.

```
salt-call lgpo.get_policy "Take ownership of files or other objects" machine

local:
    - BUILTIN\Administrators
```
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Create a state file to enforce only the `Administrators` group in this policy:
```
set_administrators_take_ownership_of_files_or_other_objects:
  lgpo.set:
    - computer_policy:
        Take ownership of files or other objects:
          - Administrators
    - cumulative_rights_assignments: False
```

When the state is applied with `test=True`, pending changes are reported:
```
local:
----------
          ID: set_administrators_take_ownership_of_files_or_other_objects
    Function: lgpo.set
      Result: None
     Comment: The following policies are set to change:
              Take ownership of files or other objects
     Started: 09:18:03.523000
    Duration: 15.0 ms
     Changes:
```

When run without `test=True`, salt reports that there are no changes to be made.

```
local:
----------
          ID: set_administrators_take_ownership_of_files_or_other_objects
    Function: lgpo.set
      Result: True
     Comment: The following policies are in the correct state:
              Take ownership of files or other objects
     Started: 09:20:03.921000
    Duration: 26830.0 ms
     Changes:
```

Note that if changes are required, Salt does perform the changes correctly.  It just continues to report pending changes whether they are needed or not.

**Expected behavior**
When this state is applied with `test=True`, no pending changes should be reported.
