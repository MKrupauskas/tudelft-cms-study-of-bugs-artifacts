Tested with: 
- master 0.17.0 on Debian 7.1
- minions 0.17.0 on RHEL5 and RHEL6

This bug occurs only on RHEL5 minions.

State: 

```
root:
  user.present:
    - password: 'xxx'
    - roomnumber: 'xxx'
    - workphone: 'xxx'
```

Result on RHEL5:

```
State: - user
Name:      root
Function:  present
    Result:    True
    Comment:   Updated user root
    Changes:   groups: ['root']
```

Before running highstate:

```
root:x:0:root
bin:x:1:root,bin,daemon
daemon:x:2:root,bin,daemon
sys:x:3:root,bin,adm
adm:x:4:root,adm,daemon
```

After running highstate on RHEL5:

```
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:bin,daemon
daemon:x:2:bin,daemon
sys:x:3:bin,adm
adm:x:4:adm,daemon
```

After running highstate on RHEL6:

```
root:x:0:root
bin:x:1:root,bin,daemon
daemon:x:2:root,bin,daemon
sys:x:3:root,bin,adm
adm:x:4:root,adm,daemon
```

After explicitely stating "remove_groups: False" this behavior doesn't occur anymore. Is there a change in the default behavior that hasn't been documented ? Default is True in the current doc.
