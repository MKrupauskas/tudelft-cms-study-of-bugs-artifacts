### Description of Issue/Question
For many devices, I see this error continuously appearing in the minion proxy logs:
Exception argument of type 'bool' is not iterable occurred in scheduled job

I am using a elastic search returner for all salt logs and it is getting clogged with this same message too many times.

It happens with both Cisco and Juniper device.
Any idea what could be the issue?

### Setup
Pillar file is pretty simple:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: napalm
  driver: ios
  host: 1.2.4.5
  username: *****
  password: *****
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
