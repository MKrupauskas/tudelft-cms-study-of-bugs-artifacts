### Description of Issue/Question
Use acme.cert state, failure to issue a certificate causes a Traceback when it attempts to get the certificate information

### Setup
State for acme.cert to issue certificate for applyrandomdomain.com and www.applyrandomdomain.com
```
certbot_applyrandomdomain:
  acme.cert:
    - name: applyrandomdomain.com
    - renew: 60
    - aliases:
      - www.applyrandomdomain.com
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Certificate failed to issue due to error from certbot. The state doesn't capture the error and continues to attempt to get the information of the certificate as part of the return. Due to the certificate not existing (file not found), the acme.info module throws a Traceback.

```
Starting new HTTPS connection (1): acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org
Skipped user interaction because Certbot doesn't appear to be running in a terminal. You should probably include --non-interactive or --force-interactive on the command line.
Obtaining a new certificate
Performing the following challenges:
http-01 challenge for applyrandomdomain.com
http-01 challenge for www.applyrandomdomain.com
Using the webroot path /var/lib/letsencrypt/webroot for all unmatched domains.
Waiting for verification...

```

states/acme.py has the following code, which is failing to detect the error from the acme.cert module, and blindly attempts to run the acme.info module on a non-existent certificate
```python
    res = __salt__['acme.cert'](
        name,
        aliases=aliases,
        email=email,
        webroot=webroot,
        test_cert=test_cert,
        renew=renew,
        keysize=keysize,
        server=server,
        owner=owner,
        group=group
    )

    ret = {
        'name': name,
        'result': res['result'] is not False,
        'comment': res['comment']
    }

    if res['result'] is None:
        ret['changes'] = {}
    else:
        ret['changes'] = {
            'old': old,
            'new': __salt__['acme.info'](name)
        }
```
