Hi,

I've installed Debian Buster (now stable), then dist-upgraded to Bullseye (now testing), then installed salt-minion 3002.2+dfsg1-1.

When running cmd.run (on a different machine with salt-master 2019.2.7+ds-1) it returns successfully:

```shell
$ salt 'logs*' cmd.run 'curl -sS https://something.example.com/'
logsxxx.example.com:
    some response
```

But when running with timeout:

```shell
$ salt 'logs*' cmd.run 'curl -sS https://something.example.com/' timeout=60
logsxxx.example.com:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1889, in _thread_return

    AttributeError: 'Thread' object has no attribute 'isAlive'
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

I guess the reason is that isAlive was removed from Python 3.9: https://bugs.python.org/issue37804

Thread.is_alive() should be used instead: https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.is_alive

Which works the same way as isAlive did: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.isAlive
