The py renderer does not inherit salt `__vars__` objects used for file templates; giving the error:
`NameError: global name '__pillar__' is not defined`

I feel this takes away much of the power of using the py renderer for templates, since pillar (and grain) data can't be extracted.  The python code seems to run in isolation, so it's not possible to load the pillar data by hand either (though this would be less than ideal.)

The documentation at http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html doesn't warn of this either.

Tested on version 2014.1.7.
