### Description of Issue/Question
When specifying `ex_disks_gce_struct` with a `sourceImage` in a salt-cloud profile without specifying an image I see this error:

`[ERROR   ] The required 'image' configuration setting is missing from the 'gce-test-extra' profile, which is configured under the 'gce-config' alias.`

### Setup
Using the current `gce-test-extra` profile in the test suite located [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2016.11.1/tests/integration/files/conf/cloud.profiles.d/gce.conf#L12)

As you can see above it does not specify an image, and i'm assuming it is trying to use the sourceimage specified underneath `ex_disks_gce_struct` to boot up an ubuntu image.

ping @junckritter looks like you added this test here and feature here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/22785

Was this intentional to leave out `image` in that profile setup? If so it looks like this is a bug and we will need to add some logic to ensure we get pass this check for image if gce is configured to use a sourceimage.

I tested by removing the logic that checks for image just ot make sure it still works and it looks like the VM is created. 

### Versions Report
I tested on 2015.8.10, 2016.3.4 and 2016.11.0 and saw the same behavior.
