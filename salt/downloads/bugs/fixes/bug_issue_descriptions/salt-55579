### Description of Issue

The `lgpo.set` state in `salt.states.win_lgpo` does not seem to preserve all previously set Local Group Policies when run twice (with different sets of policies).

### Setup

A sample `top.sls`:
```yaml
base:
  '*':
    - lgpo1
    - lgpo2
```

`lgpo1/init.sls`:
```yaml
LGPO 1:
  lgpo.set:
    - computer_policy:
        "Force a specific default lock screen and logon image":
          LockScreenImage: 'C:\Users\Public\Pictures\login_background.jpg'
          LockScreenOverlaysDisabled: True
```

`lgpo2/init.sls`:
```yaml
LGPO 2:
  lgpo.set:
    - computer_policy:
        "Turn off Autoplay":
            "Turn off Autoplay on": "All drives"
        "Configure Solicited Remote Assistance": Disabled
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

In the above setup, the "Force a specific default lock screen and logon image" group policy becomes "Not configured" if the highstate is applied. Manually executing states lgpo2,lgpo1 (so in reversed order) _does_ work.

It seems like the second run of `lgpo.set` does not detect the existing setting of "Force a specific ...", and fails to preserve it.

Other Group Policies are fine; the ones that I saw as being affected are ones that take string elements. Another example: the user policy "Desktop Wallpaper".
