I am seeing this error using git.latest in 2014.4.4 - 2014.4.7 :

```
You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
              want to merge with, and 'branch.master.merge' in
              your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
              specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
              try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
              See git-pull(1) for details.

              If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
              use something like the following in your configuration file:
                  [branch "master"]
                  remote = <nickname>
                  merge = <remote-ref>

                  [remote "<nickname>"]
                  url = <url>
                  fetch = <refspec>

              See git-config(1) for details.

```

My state looks like

```
salt-extension-modules:
  git.latest:
    - name: https://username:password@github.com/repo/salt-states.git
    - target: {{ salt['pillar.get']('salt_root', '/opt/local/salt-states') }}
    - rev: master
```

The problem is clearly this:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'git pull ' in directory '/opt/local/salt-states'
```

If I just do `cd /opt/local/salt-states; git pull` it fails with the same message.

Could be an issue with older version of git? I think they might have changed this behavior recently. (running in Ubuntu 12.04)

```
$ git --version
git version 1.7.9.5
```
