I added some notes to the docs a while back to document this "feature" of PyYAML, but I think it would be better to simply override this behavior in salt.utils.yamlloader. I poked around in the code for a few hours today and couldn't think of a good solution for this issue. The best way to do this, it would seem, would be to override the `u'tag:yaml.org,2002:bool` resolver (see [here](http://www.pyyaml.org/browser/pyyaml/trunk/lib/yaml/resolver.py#L167)), but I can't see how to do this.
