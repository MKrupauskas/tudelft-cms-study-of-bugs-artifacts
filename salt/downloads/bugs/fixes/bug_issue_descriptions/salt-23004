Salt-Master: 2014.7.5 - Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Salt-Minion: 2014.7.5 - Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise

NXLog is an x86 application that runs on both x86 & AMD64 Windows Server platforms that parses log messages and sends to a syslog server. I'm trying to utilize SaltStack's Windows repo feature to manage this application on my minions to keep it & its related configuration up to date. When I run..

```
salt 'myserver' pkg.refresh_db
salt 'myserver' pkg.list_pkgs
```

I get output such as...

```
SQL Server 2008 R2 Client Tools:
    10.50.1600.1
SQL Server 2008 R2 Common Files:
    10.50.1600.1
SQL Server 2008 R2 Database Engine Services:
    10.50.1600.1
```

...with my packages listed, except that NXLog-CE _NEVER_ shows up. The only thing that I can think of is the fact that it's an x86 package on an AMD64 cpuarch system, possibly causing the issue. I've got NXLog (version 2.9.1347) running on lots of Windows systems, and it does not show up in the pkg.list_pkgs output for any of these systems (all Server 2008).

In regards to the actual SaltStack setup on my master, my SLS for this package looks as follows for the moment:

```
nxlog:
  2.9.1347:
    installer: '/srv/salt/win/repo/nxlog/files/nxlog-ce-2.9.1347.msi'
    full_name:  'NXLog-CE'
    reboot: False
    install_flags: '/quiet /norestart'
    msiexec: True
    uninstaller: '/srv/salt/win/repo/nxlog/files/nxlog-ce-2.9.1347.msi'
    uninstall_flags: '/quiet /norestart'
```

I have confirmed that running "nxlog.msi /quiet /norestart" runs successfully on the server. When I try to run:

```
salt 'myserver' pkg.install 'nxlog'
```

I get the following:

```
myserver:
    ----------
```

The last thing of note that is that my salt-minion's log file is completely empty, so I don't see anything relevant there. Also, uninstalled/reinstalled the package, all that good stuff - to no avail. I'm just curious if I'm doing something incorrectly (very possible), or if this is a bug of some sort. Thanks!
