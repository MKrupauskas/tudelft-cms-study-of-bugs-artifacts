Hi there,

I've got this problem on both installations of Debian 7 wheeze (GCE) and Ubuntu 14.04 (AWS) by setting master_sign_pubkey: True in /etc/salt/master
Then I restart service by `service salt-master restart` and there is no generated certs in /etc/salt/pki/master/

In both cases salt-master was installed by:

```
sudo curl -L http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh -s -- -M -N -P -L -p salt-cloud -p python-dev -p python-pip stable
```

```
