I haven't tested all the variations of this not working but this state is not working for me.

```
installer_local_grants:
  mysql_grants.present:
    - grant: all privileges
    - database: install\_%.*
    - user: installer
    - host: localhost
```

It produces `install\\_\%` for the database not `install\_%`
When I set `- escape: False` I get the following error

```
Function: mysql_grants.present
Result: False

I've posted this on StackOverflow as well at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32362573/salt-stack-mysql-grants-present-underscore-wildcard

I'm using this on
