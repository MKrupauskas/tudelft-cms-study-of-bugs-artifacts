### Description of Issue/Question
salt-cloud does not handle exceptions when ec2 does not return encoding.
### Setup
I am able to reproduce this with a stock 2016.11.1 install using salt-cloud on ubuntu 16.04. Any VM I have tried to create has had this issue.

Stack trace is:
[DEBUG   ] Using AWS endpoint: ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
[DEBUG   ] AWS Request: https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=DescribeInstances&InstanceId.1=i-0fdd120e73a86763a&Version=2014-10-01
[DEBUG   ] AWS Response Status Code: 400
[ERROR   ] There was a query error: encode() argument 1 must be string, not None

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/aws.py", line 464, in query
    result.text.encode(result.encoding)
TypeError: encode() argument 1 must be string, not None

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create a VM profile configured to connect via the private IP. Attempt to provision a machine in ec2 with it. I was able to work around it by just printing result.text and not attempting to encode it.
