Just built latest 2014.7.0 branch and am getting am getting the following error in the s3 module: 
`Module function s3.get threw an exception. Exception: local variable 'data' referenced before assignment`

The s3.get function worked just fine for me from the v2014.7.0 tag release.  The error appears to be related to this pull request https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/8a885fc38f9d838c584786a3fea227232463e1f4 on line 153 `data` will not be defined if the method is anything other than a 'PUT' request https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/utils/s3.py#L153
