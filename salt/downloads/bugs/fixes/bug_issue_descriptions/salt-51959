### Description of Issue/Question

It appears the acl.present state has a bug between versions 2018.3.3 and 2018.3.4. The following output is showing up during a test run in 2018.3.4:

          ID: Starfleet FACL
    Function: acl.present
        Name: /path/to/directory
      Result: None
     Comment: Updated permissions will be applied for starfleet: 5 -> rx

     Changes:   
              ----------
              new:
                  ----------
                  acl_name:
                      starfleet
                  acl_type:
                      group
                  perms:
                      rx
              old:
                  ----------
                  acl_name:
                      starfleet
                  acl_type:
                      group
                  perms:
                      5
This does not show up if I roll back to 2018.3.3. My guess is under the hood it is not seeing that "rx" is the same as "5".  I can apply the changes, and it does it, but then the message re-appears again during a test run. I looked at the docs for the state and "perms" uses rwx, not numeric.

### Setup

    'Starfleet FACL':
      acl.present:
        - name: /path/to/directory
        - acl_type: group
        - acl_name: starfleet
        - perms: rx
        - recurse: True
        - require:
          - pkg: 'Starfleet Packages'

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Update from 2018.3.3 to 2018.3.4
