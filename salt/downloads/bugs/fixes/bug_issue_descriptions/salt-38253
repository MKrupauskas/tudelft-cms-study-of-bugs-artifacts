### Description of Issue/Question

The `pip.installed` state function gives a warning when installing setuptools. This is because `pip freeze` does not list the components of pip in its output.

The solution, I think, is to add `--all` at the appropriate place in the `pip.freeze` function, which I can do when I get a free hour, but I wanted to record this here now.

### Setup

With this state declaration:

```
python_pip_setuptools:
  pip.installed:
    - name: setuptools >= 30
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Running salt produces:

```
----------
          ID: python_pip_setuptools
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: setuptools >= 30
      Result: True
     Comment: There was no error installing package 'setuptools >= 30' although it does not show when calling 'pip.freeze'.
