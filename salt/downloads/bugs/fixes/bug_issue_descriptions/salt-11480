I updated our master to 2014.1.0-1.  It went really smooth.  The majority of our minions are running 0.17.x and they all kept working without any problems.  I did notice though that the couple of 2014.0.1-1 minions that we have are failing when running a high state.  They are failing with errors on anything that refers to env, like so:

Rendering SLS "prod:packages.autofs" failed: Jinja variable 'env' is undefined; line 54

I can use cmd.run to run commands against these minions from the salt master though, that works without any issues.  I was told on #salt that the env variable would continue to be used for a while but would eventually be deprecated down the road.  Our 0.17.x minions don’t seem to have any issues with it and they are using the same sls files so it seems to only be the 2014.x minions.

Here’s the full error from a high state:
