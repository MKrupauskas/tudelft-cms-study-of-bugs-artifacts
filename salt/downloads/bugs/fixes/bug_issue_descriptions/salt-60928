**Description**
Changes to the repo.saltproject.io repo URLs apparently landing today have not been concurrently accomodated in the script served from https://bootstrap.saltproject.io. This is currently causing multiple versions of salt minion to fail to install for us as the script 404s on the repo pull. I have tried several versions between 3000 and 3003 and all failed.

**Setup**
Our targets are Ubuntu 18.04 LTS in Google Cloud Platform. The bootstrap script was tested working yesterday but is failing today. Initially it was detected during GCE startup script operation on freshly instantiated VMs, but the problem has been reproduced in debugging attempts on running machines as well.
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
curl -fsSL https://bootstrap.saltproject.io -o install_salt.sh
sudo /bin/sh ./install_salt.sh -A salt -D -P stable <any_version>

**Expected behavior**
salt-minion installs without error

**Versions Report**
As the minion has not been installed, cannot produce a version report. Attempted bootstrap install with several versions, but always 404s on repo.saltproject.io URLs.
