boto_elb can manage cnames for elbs, but when I initially wrote this, I didn't make a call out the the boto_route53 state module, but reimplemented a lot of the logic. So, the boto_elb state now suffers the same issue as #18720. We should use boto_asg as an example (which calls out to the boto_lc state module), and have boto_elb call the boto_route53 state module, which already has a fix to this issue.
