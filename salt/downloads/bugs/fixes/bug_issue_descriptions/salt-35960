### Description of Issue/Question

If I sync changes to an existing custom beacon via `_beacons/` and `saltutil.sync_all`, the new changes are not picked up by the minion unless I restart the minion. `saltutil.refresh_beacons` also does not work. The event fires, but the new beacon is not loaded.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Sync a custom beacon to the minion, with some logs so you can see it firing.
- Add new logs to the custom beacon
- Sync the new version with `saltutil.sync_all` (and `saltutil.refresh_beacons` for good measure)
- Watch for the new logs to appear (they won't)
