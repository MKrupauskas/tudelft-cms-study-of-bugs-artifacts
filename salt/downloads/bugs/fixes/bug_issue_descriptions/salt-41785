### Description of Issue/Question
If I have a working master tops providing my top file data and don't have a top.sls file at `/srv/salt/top.sls`, then the minion gets DEBUG and ERROR entries in its log. This is likely because the master top system was originally designed to supplement, but not replace regular top files.

### Setup
I have a custom top file here:

```
cat /srv/extension_modules/tops/testtop.py
import logging
import sys

__virtualname__ = 'testtop'

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def __virtual__():
    return __virtualname__

def top(**kwargs):
    log.debug('Calling top in testtop')
    return {'base': ['nonano']}
```

My master config:

```
extension_modules: /srv/extension_modules
master_tops:
  testtop: True
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/

log_level_logfile: debug
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I run the following:

```
sudo salt \* state.show_top
dasalt:
    ----------
    base:
        - nonano
```

This is correct because that's all my test master top returns.
But I get the following logs entries in the minion log:

```
2017-06-15 16:57:41,777 [salt.fileclient  ][DEBUG   ][12332] Could not find file 'salt://top.sls' in saltenv 'base'
2017-06-15 16:57:41,777 [salt.state       ][DEBUG   ][12332] No contents loaded for env: base
2017-06-15 16:57:41,777 [salt.state       ][ERROR   ][12332] No contents found in top file. Please verify that the 'file_roots' specified in 'etc/master' are accessible: {'base': []}
2017-06-15 16:57:41,780 [salt.crypt       ][DEBUG   ][12332] Loaded minion key: /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem
```

If I add a top file at `/srv/salt/top.sls` with any valid entry, then the above error disappears.

I'm thinking that having top data come from the master tops should be enough and not require those log entries.
