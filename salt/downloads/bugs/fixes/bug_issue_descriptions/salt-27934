Reproduction steps:
1. Run salt-master in foreground: salt-master -l debug
2. Wait some time to let it start
3. Press Ctrl-C

Result:
1. Master doesn't release the terminal. Terminal output is the following:

```
^C[DEBUG   ] Gathering reactors for tag salt/event/exit
[WARNING ] Stopping the Salt Master
[WARNING ] Exiting on Ctrl-c
[INFO    ] The salt master is shut down
[DEBUG   ] Stopping the multiprocessing logging queue listener
[DEBUG   ] Stopped the multiprocessing logging queue listener
```
1. Two master processes still alive: process manager that just waits all processes exit and event return that hangs

```
$ ps aux | grep salt-master
dimm      3084  0.1  0.5 307268 41140 pts/2    S+   11:19   0:00 python ./scripts/salt-master -l debug ProcessManager
dimm      3159  0.0  0.4 389380 34896 pts/2    Sl+  11:19   0:00 python ./scripts/salt-master -l debug EventReturn
```

Analyze:
Actually the EventReturn main loop handles KeyboardInterrupt exception on a proper way. But most of the time EventReturn spend in poll that is called by SaltEvent._get_event() that already catches KeyboardInterrupt and returns a special event with tag 'salt/event/exit' instead of raising exception.

So the proper way to handle keyboard interrupt would be not the only catch the exception but also handle the exit event.
