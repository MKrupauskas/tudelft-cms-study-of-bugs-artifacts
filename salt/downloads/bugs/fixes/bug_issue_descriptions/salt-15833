```
library:
  git:
  - latest
  - name: 'deploy@loadbalancer:/opt/deploy/library'
  - rev: origin/master
  - force_checkout: True
  - target: /srv/library
  - identity: /root/deploy_private_key
  - always_fetch: True
  - require:
    - file: deploy_private_key
```

If there is no repo in `/opt/deploy/library` repository is still created. But it's empty. On the next run salt calls `rev-parse HEAD` and that fails on empty repo. 

```
[INFO    ] Executing state git.latest for deploy@loadbalancer:/opt/deploy/library
[INFO    ] Executing command 'git rev-parse HEAD' in directory '/srv/library'
[ERROR   ] Command 'git rev-parse HEAD' failed with return code: 128
[ERROR   ] stdout: HEAD
[ERROR   ] stderr: fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
[ERROR   ] fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
```

This could be fixed by checking that `rev-parse HEAD` does not fail and if it does assume that there is no HEAD and just checkout. IMO the HEAD call is only needed to display the revision in log.
