### Description of Issue
`require_any` crashes state jobs with "maximum recursion depth exceeded" when any of its argument requisites are not defined. This deviates from the behavior of `require` which fails the task with the comment, "The following requisites were not found:[requisite]" when a requisite is undefined. It would be great if `require_any` would handle an undefined requisite gracefully.

### Setup
test.sls:
```
{% if False %}
one:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: git
{% endif %}

test:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo
    - require_any:
      - pkg: one
```

require_any error:
```

For comparison here is the result with `require_any` replaced by `require`:
