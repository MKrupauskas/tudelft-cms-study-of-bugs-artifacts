I have ~25 Windows 7 Enterprise x86_64 (en_US) clients running Salt 2014.7.0 amd64 (detailed version reports below).

When running this command, the error messages listed below show up in a non-deterministic behaviour:

``` bash
salt-run fileserver.update && salt -C 'G@os:Windows' saltutil.sync_all
```

**Error message 1**

```
MN1221-C0014:
    ERROR: Path 'top.sls' is not absolute
```

**Error message 2**

Sometimes they don't show up at all, sometimes the first message, sometimes the second one.
It looks like there's a race-condition between the actions of `fileserver.update` on the master and `saltutil.sync_all` on the minion.

I was never able to reproduce this on any Linux minion.

I was never able to reproduce this by just running `saltutil.sync_all` on a Minion - this only happens when `fileserver.update` was run on the master immediately before by chaining it conditionally in front of `saltutil.sync_all` with `&&`.

It doesn't require any changes/commits on the fileserver to be made which are pulled in via `fileserver.update` - simply calling it without any changes is enough.
