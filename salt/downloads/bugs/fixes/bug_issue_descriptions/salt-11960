as a continue to this [thread](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/11958) 

when I"m applying the state below

```
application.wait.4.manager:
  tomcat.wait:
    - timeout: 600
    - url: http://localhost:8080/manager

wait.application.restart.tomcat.after.deploy:
  tomcat.wait:
    - use:
      - tomcat: application.wait.4.manager
```

I'm getting a response back from the minion

```
                  tomcat_|-wait.application.restart.tomcat.after.deploy_|-wait.application.restart.tomcat.after.deploy_|-wait:

                      warnings:

`use` indeed is not a valid argument of `tomcat.wait` but it is used as a requisite so the error message here is not relevant...

a similar issue occurs when applying the below state

```
postfix.config:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/postfix/master
    - source: salt://somewhere..

postfix:
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - require:
      - pkg: mailpkgs
    - watch:
      - file: postfix.config
```

when the `postfix.config` changes it triggers the `postfix` `service.mod_watch` function
but the state returns the error message below

```
                  service_|-postfix_|-postfix_|-running:
                      ----------
                      __run_num__:
                          29
                      changes:
                          ----------
                          postfix:
                              True
                      comment:
                          Service restarted
                      name:
                          postfix
                      result:
                          True
                      warnings:

@s0undt3ch, you can now recreate this in a test :smile:
