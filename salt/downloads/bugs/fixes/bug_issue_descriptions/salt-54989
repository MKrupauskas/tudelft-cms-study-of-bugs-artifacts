### Description of Issue
iLO module does not work on python 3 and following error is returned:
```Passed invalid arguments: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'.```

I read the source code and it seems "mode" is not passed to "NamedTemporaryFile" and since default mode is "w+b" I got this problem.
[Here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/124c8ecb3c93c5d5b5f1e1265771f91a92817883/salt/modules/ilo.py#L42) is the mentioned line of code

I fixed this issue by adding " mode='w' " to this file

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt-call ilo.network
