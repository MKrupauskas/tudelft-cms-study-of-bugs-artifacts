I am trying to use the peer communication system, and i'm running into some issues. I was attempting to pass a dictionary to a runner on the master using the the publish.runner function through arg parameter, but it kept failing to properly parse. This is because _normalize_arg() (also used by publish.publish) simply does a split(',') instead of using a more advanced way of parsing the arguments. The end result is that we cannot pass dictionaries, or any other strings with embedded commas back to the master.
