since the removal of _get_msi_software in win_pkg.py (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/compare/v2014.7.5...v2014.7.6) the pkg module in windows is not working as expected.
I've tried it with 2015.5 and 2015.8 branches with the same results.

The ''if key in name_map'' condition(https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/modules/win_pkg.py#L238) is not evaluated properly against the _get_reg_software() keys (I think its due to encoding issues) and therefor the keys are not properly replaces with the mappings and packages keeps trying to reinstalled themselves.
to be more specific the name_map loaded from the repo cache (in get_repo_data) loads str and the keys returned from get_reg_software are unicodes so if you have a character like "®" it will fail to find it in the name_map.
the function _get_msi_software was somehow replacing "®" with "r" so the bug wasn't visible...
Adding those following lines before https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/modules/win_pkg.py#L236 solve the problem:

```
u_name_map = {}
for k in name_map.keys():
    u_name_map[unicode(k,'utf-8')] = name_map[k]
name_map = u_name_map
```
