When using `salt-ssh` as a normal user I should be able to use password authentication without requiring the generation of keys.

```
 ls -al /etc/salt/roster
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 518 Feb 27 11:50 /etc/salt/roster

 salt-ssh monster -r 'echo I AM ALIVE'
salt-ssh could not be run because it could not generate keys.

You can probably resolve this by executing this script with increased permissions via sudo or by running as root.
You could also use the '-c' option to supply a configuration directory that you have permissions to read and write to.
```
