Recently we upgraded the salt version to 3000.3 and we get the below error, when we try to execute a command 

+ salt -G environment:x state.sls *.sls 

Exception occurred while handling stream: 3279509 exceeds max_str_len(1048576).   

Above command generates oddly 4 lines. 

Gone through couple of reports related to this issue and it was related to msgpack version used > 0.5.6.  But salt 3000.3 version demands msgpack 0.6.2. 

When installed msgpack 0.5.6, while starting the salt master it throws  below error. 

pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'msgpack!=0.5.5,<1.0.0,>=0.5' distribution was not found and is required by salt .

We use RHEL 6.10 with python 2.7  and took rpm from below.

https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/6.10/x86_64/archive/3000.3/.

Downgrade is the only option?
