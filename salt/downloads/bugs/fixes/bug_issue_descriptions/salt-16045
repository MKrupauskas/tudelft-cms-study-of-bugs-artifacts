The docs imply that a list can be given to `onlyif` by stating:

```
If all of the commands in onlyif return True, then the state is run.
```

However, it appears that `onlyif` only evaluates the first command given. Here's the test state, where `asdf/asdf/` does not exist on the test system.

```
patch:
  pkg.installed:
    - onlyif:
      - echo $?
      - cd /asdf/asdf/
```

And here is the output:

```

The state is executed, even though the second command should have given a `1` ret code:

```
root@nt-testing:/srv/salt# cd /asdf/asdf/
-bash: cd: /asdf/asdf/: No such file or directory
root@nt-testing:/srv/salt# echo $?
1
```

For sanity's sake, I have executed the same file but replaced `onlyif` with `unless`, and the `cd /asdf/asdf/` command returns False, and the sate executes as it should using `unless`:
