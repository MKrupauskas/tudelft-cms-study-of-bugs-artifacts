On Windows 8.1 minions, the 'osversion' grain has a value of '6.2.9200'. This is incorrect. The correct value is '6.3.9600'. I don't know how the minion gets the wrong bit of info, but if I had to guess, I'd say it might have something to do with Microsoft changing how it reports system information and the new APIs for Windows 8.1 -- and that when using the old APIs, Windows 8.1 responds with the version number for Windows 8.0.
