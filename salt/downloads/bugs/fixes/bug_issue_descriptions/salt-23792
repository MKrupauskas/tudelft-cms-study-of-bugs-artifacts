Right now, when trying to insert a job with the same name as another job, the salt call returns with a true, but should probably return with a false: 

```
root@vm:~# salt '*' schedule.add test_schedule_1 function=test.ping seconds=35
vm.vagrant.int:
    ----------
    comment:
        Added job: test_schedule_1 to schedule.
    result:
        True
```
