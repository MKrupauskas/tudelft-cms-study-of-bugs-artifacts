Highly problematic since it leads to writing in the Environment key a value that can be a very long string.
This can possibly saturate the value label field and you have then an environment variable created with its name that is a PATH list.
This entry could not be erasable by any Windows tool that I know (regedit cannot see it and blocks the display of subsequent alphabetically ordered values in the Environment key).
In particular, %windir% cannot be accessed anymore by the Windows administrative tools.

The fix I can see is:
edit salt/bin/Lib/site-packages/salt/modules/reg.py line 223:

``` python
def set_key(hkey, path, value, key=None, vtype='REG_DWORD', reflection=True):
```

This seems wrong (And broke my Environment key definitions)
-> Wrong order for arguments (Key value inversion): It should be ->

``` python
def set_key(hkey, path, key=None, value=None, vtype='REG_DWORD', reflection=True):
```

PS : This is one of the 10 lines I got in my registry (PATH defined the wrong way... And hard to remove afterwards):

```
