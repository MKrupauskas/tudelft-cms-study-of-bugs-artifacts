issue from #55627 
the `directory_exists` and `file_exists` do not work properly on Windows paths

- file exists, so should **not** be executed
`{% if not salt['file.file_exists']('/path/to/file') %}`
**this is executed**
`{% endif %}`

- file exists, so should be executed
`{% if salt['file.file_exists']('/path/to/file') %}`
**this is NOT executed**
`{% endif %}`

Same for `file.directory_exists`

Windows files **are** being correctly detected by `creates:` in `cmd.script` though, so it isn't universal that Windows paths are not being detected properly.
