###  Arista EOS salt-minion debug mode flooded
When running the Arista EOS minion [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/eos.html), the command line is flooded with the same repeated message. Possible repeated behavior of #49082 ?
```
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded state.apply
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job job1 was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job job1 was scheduled with a max number of 1
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job __mine_interval was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)
[DEBUG   ] schedule: Job __mine_interval was scheduled with a max number of 2
...
```

### Setup
Arista EOS minion directly installed on Arista switch: `salt-minion 2018.3.0-2772-g34b3b90 (Oxygen)`
Salt-master: `salt-master 2018.3.2 (Oxygen)`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install the salt-minion according to https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/eos.html
Configure the master for multi-master with failover [here](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster_pki.html#tutorial-multi-master-pki):
**Master**
```
master_sign_pubkey: True
```

**Minion**
```
master: 172.16.0.1
verify_master_pubkey_sign: True
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 90
######   NAPALM connection settings   ######
############################################
napalm:
  driver: eos
  optional_args:
    eos_transport: socket
```

Copy the `/etc/salt/pki/master_sign.pub` to the switch's `/etc/salt/pki/`

Run the salt-master, and then start the minion in debug mode:
`salt-minion -l debug`
```
