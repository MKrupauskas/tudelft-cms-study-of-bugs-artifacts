Howdy!

I've been seeing an issue where salt-key can take up to about 2 minutes to return on a 2GB master with 6 minions. A strace on the salt-key process revealed that on a salt-key run that took 34 seconds it spent 31 seconds reading data from the ldap server I have pam setup to use on these boxes, thousands of usernames and group names filled most of the strace output.

Stopping the nslcd service resolves this issue, but of course creates a different problem for me :)
