### Description of Issue/Question

Somehow my master lost the knowledge about pillars on some minions. I have 6 minions with the following pillar:

``` yaml
labels:
  lb: true
```

On one day only 4 started reporting instead of 6 and **there were no indication that anything is missing**:

```
ivan@foo4:~$ sudo salt -I labels:lb:true test.ping
foo26:
    True
foo12:
    True
foo19:
    True
foo35:
    True
```

Once I figured that out from people complaining that some certs have different expiration dates (luckily they were all still valid), I synced everything across the fleet:

```
ivan@foo4:~$ sudo salt -b 10 '*' saltutil.sync_all
```

Then my lost minions were found, but were not responding according to salt cli:

```
ivan@foo4:~$ sudo salt -I labels:lb:true test.ping
foo26:
    True
foo12:
    True
foo19:
    True
foo35:
    True
foo41:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
foo49:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
```

This is unexpected, since I just saw them replying successfully to `saltutil.sync_all` command.

Here comes the fun, they actually reply when you target them by names:

```
ivan@foo4:~$ sudo salt -L foo12,foo19,foo26,foo35,foo41,foo49 test.ping
foo26:
    True
foo19:
    True
foo12:
    True
foo35:
    True
foo49:
    True
foo41:
    True
```

I checked pillar cache on master and it was fresh (after `saltutil.sync_all` everywhere). I did `strace` on salt minion during label match run and it was silent. I did the same during name match and it got chatty.

Salt master restart did not fix the issue. When I target `*` problematic minions respond.

My guess is that master does not send commands to these minions for some reason.
