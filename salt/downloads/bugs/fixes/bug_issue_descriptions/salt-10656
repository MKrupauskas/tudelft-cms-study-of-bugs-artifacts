After updating salt to 2014.1 (from 0.17) the cron state is not working anymore.

I was under the impression it was because the crontab for user root was empty but even with something on it (in this case a comment) the state still fails.

[INFO    ] Running state [salt://cron/configs/ops_root.txt] at time 16:47:40.498803
[INFO    ] Executing state cron.file for salt://cron/configs/ops_root.txt

[INFO    ] stdout: #

This is an Arch Linux box ( 2.6.32-23-pve #1 SMP Tue Aug 6 07:04:06 CEST 2013 x86_64 GNU/Linux) running as a container on proxmox.
