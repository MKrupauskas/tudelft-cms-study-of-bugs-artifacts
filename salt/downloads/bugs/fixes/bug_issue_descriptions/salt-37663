## Description
I had a state using service module which failed due to "one or more requisite failed". First I checked the minion log but failed to see anything related to that state. Only after I checked the cloud-init-output.log (we are using cloud-init to run highstate the first time) I noticed in the summary that the state failed because some requisite failed. I would like to see something about the failed service state in the minion log as I often look only to that to see what goes on with Salt.

### Setup
Not really the SLS I'm using but should be enough to demonstrate the problem. First state fails for whatever reason (in the example the repo shouldn't exist), and because the first state fails this will happen to the second state too.

	download-example-script:
	  git.latest:
		- name: https://github.com/non-existent/example
		- force_reset : True
		- target: /root/tmp/example

	enable-example-script:
	  file.managed:
		- name: /root/scripts/script.sh
		- source: /root/tmp/example/script.sh

	ensure-service-running:
	  service.running:
		- name: example
		- enable: True
		- full_restart: True
		- watch:
			- file: /root/scripts/*

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
INFO level Salt minion logs do not show anything related to service state "example", only the summary log which is not included in minion log shows the result and some much needed information:

----------
          ID: ensure-service-running
    Function: service.running
        Name: example
      Result: False
     Comment: One or more requisite failed: example.example.enable-example-script
