### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

Using `deb http://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/14.04/amd64/2016.3 trusty main` in source.list, it seems like 2015.8 at least is affected as well.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Add saltstack repository to system, `apt-get update`, `apt-get install salt-minion=2016.3.3+ds-1 salt-common=2016.3.3+ds-1`.
Upgrade fails because daemon fails to start with a timeout:
