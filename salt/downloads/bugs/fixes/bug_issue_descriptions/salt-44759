### Description of Issue/Question

Dockercompose module has the file name `docker-compose.yml` hard coded in the code. However this brings two problems:

1. Docker-compose also accepts `docker-compose.yaml`
2. Docker-compose also allows to supply a `-f` parameter so that you can have a `my-composefile.yml`

### Setup

When performing a `dockercompose.get` the path of the compose file is determined https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/dockercompose.py#L171 as follows:

```python
dc_filename = 'docker-compose.yml'

...

    if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, dc_filename)) is False:
        return __standardize_result(False,
                                    'Path does not exist or docker-compose.yml is not present',
                                    None, None)
    f = salt.utils.files.fopen(os.path.join(path, dc_filename), 'r')  # pylint: disable=resource-leakage
```

In docker-compose it is possible to specify your path as follows:

```bash
docker-compose -f /some/path/my-composefile.yml up -d
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt 'minion' dockercompose.get /some/path/my-composefile.yml
```

```yaml
minion:
    ----------
    message:
        Path does not exist or docker-compose.yml is not present
    status:
        False
```
