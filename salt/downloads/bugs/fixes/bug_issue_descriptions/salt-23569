On Enterprise Linux 5 operating systems Saltstack is installed from https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/saltstack/salt because of the python version required by salt is v2.6.

Augeas RPM packages are not maintained by the copr repo and thus are installed from the normal EL5 EPEL repository. but under python 2.4 directory not used by the salt-minion.

```
[root@minion5 site-packages]# find /usr/lib/ -name augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/augeas.py
```

state run

```
State 'augeas.change' found in SLS 'some state file' is unavailable`
```

Makes sense, augeas not yet installed

```
yum install \
 augeas \
 python-augeas
```

```
[root@minion5 site-packages]# find /usr/lib/ -name augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/augeas.py
```

state run:

```
State 'augeas.change' found in SLS 'some state file' is unavailable
```

Creating symlink to augeas.py in python2.4:

```
ln -s \
 /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/augeas.py \
 /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/augeas.py
```

```
[root@minion5 site-packages]# find /usr/lib/ -name augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/augeas.py
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/augeas.py
```

state run:

```
