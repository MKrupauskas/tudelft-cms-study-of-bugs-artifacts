E.g the following will never run foo2:

```
schedule:
    foo:
      function: cmd.run
      args:
        - sleep 10
      seconds: 60
    foo2:
      function: cmd.run
      args:
        - sleep 10
      seconds: 60
```

The maxrunning logic only considers the function name:

```
[DEBUG   ] Running scheduled job: foo
[DEBUG   ] schedule: This job was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)
[INFO    ] schedule: maxrunning parameter was not specified for job foo, defaulting to 1.
[DEBUG   ] Running scheduled job: __mine_interval
[DEBUG   ] schedule: This job was scheduled with jid_include, adding to cache (jid_include defaults to True)

```
