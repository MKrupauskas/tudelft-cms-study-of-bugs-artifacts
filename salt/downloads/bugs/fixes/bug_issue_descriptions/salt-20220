Since latest Debian package update (version 2014.7.1+ds-1), the behavior described in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18312 has propagated to file.managed too. Example:

```
      ID: apt-sources-salt-latest
Function: file.managed
    Name: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt-latest.list
  Result: None
 Comment: The file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt-latest.list is in the correct state
 Started: 22:21:07.723636
Duration: 10.236 ms
 Changes:   
```

This appears in yellow, as if something would change. 

Previous package had version 2014.7.0+ds-2.
