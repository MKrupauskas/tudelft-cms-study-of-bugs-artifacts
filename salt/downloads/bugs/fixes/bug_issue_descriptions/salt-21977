When you run `salt-ssh --roster scan $SOME_IP_ADDRESS\32` to target only a single IP address no host will be matched, but it works for `\31` and smaller ranges.

I added a print statement to `salt/roster/scan.py` to see targeted hosts and get the following:

```
$ salt-ssh --roster scan 127.0.0.1/32 test.ping
No hosts found with target 127.0.0.1/32 of type glob
$ salt-ssh --roster scan 127.0.0.1/31 test.ping
127.0.0.0
127.0.0.1
127.0.0.1:
    ----------
    retcode:
        254
    stderr:

    stdout:
        The host key needs to be accepted, to auto accept run salt-ssh with the -i flag:
        The authenticity of host '127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
        ECDSA key fingerprint is 06:e3:45:fd:a0:c9:75:07:04:61:10:54:d9:b1:17:92.
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

I would have expected `127.0.0.1/32` to be listed as well.
