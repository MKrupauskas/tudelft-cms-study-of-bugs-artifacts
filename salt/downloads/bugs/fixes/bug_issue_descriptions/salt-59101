**Description**

This is a continuation of https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/36127.  The attempt to fix it in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/51169 is failing because the exception has no `message` attribute in python 3.

I'll just copy what was written in the original:

> When attempting to run the following command: `salt-run winrepo.update_git_repos` I see the following error and it does not update the repos. I understand that I am getting this error because gitpython or pygit2 is not installed but there needs to be a more useful error if these requirements are not met:

```text

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

**Setup**

Ensure neither `pygit2` nor `GitPython` are installed.

**Expected behavior**

Useful error message when required dependencies are missing.
