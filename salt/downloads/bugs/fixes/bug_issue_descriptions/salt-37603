### Description of Issue/Question

Following https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/multimaster_pki.html one encounters a problem; a minion *with* the setting will crash out when connecting to a master *without* the setting & vice versa.

While I agree that getting an invalid key is a serious issue indeed this makes switching to this setup a rather difficult proposition.

So I figured I'd modify the service definitions to always restart the minion on error, giving time to propagate the change to the minions and adapt the master later on. 

*However* it turns out that the critical crash actually exits 0, so we can't restart `on-failure` 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
* Set a master without `master_sign_pubkey: True`
* Set a minion with `verify_master_pubkey_sign: True`

Start salt-minion:
```shell
[root@salt01 ~]# salt-minion
[ERROR   ] The master did not send its public-key signature, but signature verification is enabled on the minion. Either disable signature verification on the minion or enable signing the public on the master!
[CRITICAL] The Salt Master server's public key did not authenticate!
The master may need to be updated if it is a version of Salt lower than 2016.3.0-n/a-fdd13b4, or
If you are confident that you are connecting to a valid Salt Master, then remove the master public key and restart the Salt Minion.
The master public key can be found at:
/etc/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub
[WARNING ] Stopping the Salt Minion
[ERROR   ] Invalid master key
The salt minion is shutdown.Invalid master key
[root@salt01 ~]# echo $?
0
```
