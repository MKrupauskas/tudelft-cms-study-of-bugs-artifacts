@terminalmage knows the context of this issue as does @grichmond-salt 

Weâ€™ve experimented with patches changing the hardcoded limit of 60 seconds to randomly between 1-4 seconds on minion auth failure. The patches were done to prevent thundering herds from taking out the salt master.

The holy grail is for the minions to do a random exponential backoff up to $max_timeout. This makes it much more likely that the client CLI will get the correct results while still mitigating the thundering herd of minions beating up a master. This will help with minions reporting data to a syndic master, which then reports data to the master of masters not showing up in the CLI output, yet always was returning to a mysql database configured as a returner.
