### Description of Issue/Question

My test case includes using `test.sleep`. When running the following: `salt '*' test.sleep 30` if I want to cancel the command in the middle of the execution I have to hit Ctrl + C twice before it exits the command. I would expect it to stop the execution after only one Ctrl + C.

Here is the output that shows the selection of Ctrl + C twice:

```
[root@localhost ~]# salt '*' test.sleep 30
^C^CExiting on Ctrl-C
This job's jid is:
20160906201253730481
The minions may not have all finished running and any remaining minions will return upon completion. To look up the return data for this job later run:
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20160906201253730481
```
### Setup

Master and Minion. can be on same host does not matter
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run `salt '*' test.sleep 30` 
2. Before the execution finishes try to hit Ctrl + C to stop it.
