i wasn't able to get this salt-ssh working:

<pre>
pille@salt-master ~ [1] % sudo salt-ssh '*' test.version 
live3:
    /bin/sh: 60: sha1: not found
    /bin/sh: 60: [: =: unexpected operator
    /usr/bin/python2.7: can't open file '/tmp/.salt/salt-call': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
    
pille@salt-master ~ % sudo salt-ssh '*' test.ping   
live3:
    /bin/sh: 60: sha1: not found
    /bin/sh: 60: [: =: unexpected operator
    /usr/bin/python2.7: can't open file '/tmp/.salt/salt-call': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
</pre>


when i provide a symlink for <code>sha1</code> pointing to <code>sha1sum</code>.
i'm on ubuntu-12.04 and this works.

working around this, leads to #8882.
