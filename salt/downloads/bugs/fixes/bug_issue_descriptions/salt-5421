I get a list back in the grain and its matching doesn't work as expected. Mentioned this on IRC, but though it got little attention, I believe this is a real issue.

First globbing:

```
salt@MASTER:~$ salt -G 'ec2_tags:*XXXXX-production*' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

Then regexp:

```
salt@MASTER:~$ salt --grain-pcre 'ec2_tags:.*XXXXX-production.*'  test.ping
ip-MINION-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    True
ip-MINION-2.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    True
```

Are the grains made strings differently for different matching methods? Shouldn't they behave the same?
