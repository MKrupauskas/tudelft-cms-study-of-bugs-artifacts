### Description of Issue/Question

When configuring an openvswitch port in GRE-tunnel mode, the openvswitch.port_present state fails because it does not found the "dst_port" argument, which is required only in VXLAN mode.

It seems that states/openvswitch_port.py pre-generates error messages (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/af286c1e89ce7afc03bd9f53274055a3fb69ee9d/salt/states/openvswitch_port.py#L39) without checking for the "type" argument.

We could fix that, by enclosing those "comment_" var in conditions, maybe?

### Setup

I'm running this with salt-ssh:

```
openvswitch:
  pkg.installed: []
ovs-vswitchd:
  service.running:
    - enable: true
    - require:
      - pkg: openvswitch

br-lan:
  openvswitch_bridge.present: []

ovs-tun-gre:
  openvswitch_port.present:
    - bridge: br-lan
    - type: gre
    - remote: {{ ip }}
    - id: 1
```
throws:

```

(the "port_dst" parameter is optionnal when doing a GRE tunnel)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run the provided SLS on a freshly spawned arch-linux minion (you would have to adapt the pkg names for testing on other distros)
