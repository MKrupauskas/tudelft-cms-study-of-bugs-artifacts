cloud.present code should be more state full.
using the  onlyif, unless args is a /hack job/

It should first check if the VM exists before running the cloud.create salt module.

also I dont see a smiple way to find if vm is existing... so should also have cloud module function has_instance... somthing like.

```
salt['cloud.has_instance'](name, provider='all'), returns bool
```

This cloud stuff is nice and all... but the states and salt modules seem to be /second-class/ an after thought.
