### Description of Issue
Using Salt Master with this minion install Salt-Minion-2019.2.0-Py3-AMD64-Setup causes some warning when it runs.  It seems to complete fine however  

This file C:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\grains\win_drives.py has string.uppercase which apparently doesn't work in python 3, but string.ascii_uppercase does.  I'm not sure if its an issue with my master - however there are no updates available when I run yum update.

### Setup
winFeatures/init.sls
------------------------------
install_SNMP-Service:
  win_servermanager.installed:
    - name: SNMP-Service

top.sls
------------------------------
base:
 '*':
  - winFeatures

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I run on the minion machine: salt-call state.highstate

This error shows up before running the states, which seem to run fine.
[CRITICAL] Failed to load grains defined in grain file win_drives.get_harddrives in function <function get_harddrives at 0x000002B1ADC7CEA0>, error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\loader.py", line 798, in grains
    ret = funcs[ key ](**kwargs)
  File "c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\grains\win_drives.py", line 7, in get_harddrives
    for letter in string.uppercase:
AttributeError: module 'string' has no attribute 'uppercase'

To remedy this, I changed the file
"c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\extmods\grains\win_drives.py"

Line 7 has 
for letter in string.uppercase:
Changed to 
for letter in string.ascii_uppercase:

and it seemed to be fine.  However editing this file manually on every isn't great, so I've gone back to using the Py2 version of salt minion.
