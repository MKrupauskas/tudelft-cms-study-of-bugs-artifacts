Salt Version:  2014.1.3

From salt-master, I launched a job process that was going to run for a while. I decided to kill the job from the salt-master. 

I executed the following command on the salt master. 

salt '*' saltutil.kill_job '20140507124719739745'

The following exception was returned.

[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
