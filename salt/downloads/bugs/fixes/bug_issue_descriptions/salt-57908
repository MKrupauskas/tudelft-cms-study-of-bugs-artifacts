**Description**
If you attempt to start a service on macOS or Windows and the service is disabled `service.running` with fail to start the service even if the `enable: true` option is set.

This is caused by the service state wanting to enable a service after it attempts to start the state. On macOS and Windows the service state should attempt to enable a service prior to starting it. 

PR coming soon.
