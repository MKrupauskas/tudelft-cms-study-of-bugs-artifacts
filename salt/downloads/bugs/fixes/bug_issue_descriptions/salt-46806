### Description of Issue/Question

Initial authentication setup is too complex because there are different type of errors but only one log message like "Authorization failure occurred"
Verbosity is not enough for easy initial setup of authentication subsystem.

### Setup
Any common setup.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just run SaltStack with incorrect auth config.
