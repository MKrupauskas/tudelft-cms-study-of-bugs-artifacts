I have a directory that is 859GB (/xyz) and under this directory I have many directories and small files. However, I noticed that when the following state is execute the salt-minion consume a huge amounts of memory 32GB (I killed the process after that)

``` yaml
/xyz:
  mount.mounted:
    - device: /dev/sdb1
    - fstype: xfs
    - mkmnt: True
    - opts:
      - defaults,nobarrier,logbufs=8,logbsize=256k

  file.directory:
    - user: damian
    - group: damian
    - mode: 755
    - recurse:
      - user
      - group
```

I haven't dug into this much but I think the issue is with the file.direction when the recurse option is enabled.

``` bash
19772 root      20   0 16.7g  16g 3132 R 100.0 12.8   1:50.88 salt-minion                                                  
19736 root      20   0 16.7g  15g 3128 R 99.7 12.3   1:50.11 salt-minion  
```
