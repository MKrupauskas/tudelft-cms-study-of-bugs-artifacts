Exit code: 255
```

This happen due to:

```
Permission denied (publickey).
```

Which is caused by:

```
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin no
```

And/or

```
/etc/salt/cloud
delete_sshkeys: True
```

Shouldn't salt (state/delete_sshkeys/etc) wait at least until salt-cloud has finished ?

Also, it should be noted that, despite the error, the instance is provisioned successfully
