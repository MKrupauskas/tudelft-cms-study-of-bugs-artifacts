Hello,

As I've checked clouds.softlayer determines by the following logic whether to use the private or public IP address to reach the minion in create():

```
    ip_type = 'primaryIpAddress'
    private_ssh = config.get_cloud_config_value(
        'private_ssh', vm_, __opts__, default=False
    )
    private_wds = config.get_cloud_config_value(
        'private_windows', vm_, __opts__, default=False
    )
    if private_ssh or private_wds:
        ip_type = 'primaryBackendIpAddress'
```

Please consider the following:
`private_ssh=False` or `None`
`public_vlan` is unset, therefore the VM is only having a single, private address.

It defaults to the primaryIpAddress, which is the public one, however it doesn't have one. Because private_ssh is unset or false, it does not set the primaryBackendIpAddress, therefore it will try to reach the VM on its public IP, which the VM simply doesn't have.
