**Description**

In `/var/log/syslog` on the salt master I can see the following error message raised 3 consecutive times every single minute:
```
May 16 00:13:19 <hostname removed> salt-master[990]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure
May 16 00:13:19 <hostname removed> salt-master[990]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure
May 16 00:13:19 <hostname removed> salt-master[990]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure
```

It seems to be harmless, but as this is raised as an error, this is not good to have such message in the log (risk to miss other errors).

**Setup**
No specific setup, it seems that having a docker configuration on the salt master could lead to this error (see more info below)

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
I activate the debug log but no specific information is shown related to this error.
I modified the file modules/network.py to add the IP address that is causing the error, and the log is the following:
```
May 16 09:46:13 kactus salt-master[466453]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure - ip=172.17.0.1
May 16 09:46:13 kactus salt-master[466451]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure - ip=172.17.0.1
May 16 09:46:13 kactus salt-master[466455]: [ERROR   ] Exception during resolving address: [Errno 2] Host name lookup failure - ip=172.17.0.1
```

It appears that this local IP address is the one related to `docker0` (salt is not in a docker container and is not managing the configuration of any docker container)

**Expected behavior**
No error message should be raised
