##### Description

Out of order the execute sequence when use the 'names' parameters in states.
##### Environment

Master: CentOS 6.5, salt-master 2014.1.4
Minion: CentOS 6.5, salt-minion 2014.1.4
##### SLS

```
aaa:
  cmd.run:
    - names:
      - echo a1
      - echo a2

bbb:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo b1
```
##### Summary

The result says the sequence is a1->b1->a2.
It confused me.
Is it running as a1->a2->b1 sequence actually? 
or it's asynchronous running when use 'names' parameters?
Is it possible to know the actually running sequence? 

Sorry for my poor English and many question about the issue.
