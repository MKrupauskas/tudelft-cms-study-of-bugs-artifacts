When I run it the 1st time, I get this output:
    State: - pkg
    Name:      check_mk
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: check_mk=1.2.2p3.
        Changes:   check_mk: { new : Not Found
old : 
}

The 2nd time it's this:
    State: - pkg
    Name:      check_mk
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: check_mk=1.2.2p3.
        Changes:  

Since he actually installed it.
With all the other packages, I don't seem to have an issue, only this one.
The only real difference I find between this one and the other packages, is that the exe does not have a version number. (if you check properties --> details)

Tested client is a Windows 2008 R2
