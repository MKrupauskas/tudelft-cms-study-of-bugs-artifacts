### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->
In mariadb 10.4, the empty root password was removed, so the default is socket only as root or the mariadb owner (mysql).  When running a highstate this will fail if you try to write the config file during a running minion, and if you try a local reload, i've run into either race conditions or a bad idea :).

I have added this to my custom bootstrap script, directly after salt is installed and i patch mysql.py per my comments here - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/56124, then i restart salt, sleep and run the highstate (i do this through terraform and custom code)

```
# This is required for mariadb 10.4+ as root only has socket access, no more empty passwords"
  cat <<db > /etc/salt/minion.d/database-access.conf
mysql.host: 'localhost'- 
mysql.user: 'root'
mysql.unix_socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'
mysql.db: 'mysql'
mysql.charset: 'utf8'
db
```
### Setup
Basic setup, as this is a change to behaviour of the database engine not salt.  
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Using state files:
-  file.managed (database-acccess.conf)
   - This sets what i'm putting on disc, so no changes
-  pkg.installed (mariadb 10.4+)
- Run a highstate, which contains your user and grant states

It will fail b/c root is still trying to login with `mysql -u root`.

I have been installing the pure python mysql via pip for years, which is why there is not one installed, but this has never mattered.

No major, or even minor differences between this minion and the master.
