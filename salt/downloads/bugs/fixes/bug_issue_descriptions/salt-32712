When trying to set up a Schedule for doing state.apply every 30 minutes, I came across a bit of a bug, it seems.
I wanted to add a bit of Splay to my setup, but this resulted in Salt inadvertently adding in a "seconds: 0" config in the job - causing the job to restart as soon as it finishes.
### Setup

State:

```
highstate-schedule:
  schedule.present:
    - function: state.apply
    - minutes: 30
    - splay: 5
```

Results in schedule:

```
    schedule:
      highstate-schedule:
        enabled: true
        function: state.apply
        jid_include: true
        maxrunning: 1
        minutes: 30
        name: highstate-schedule
        seconds: 0
        splay: 5
```

... where the "seconds: 0" config line makes it restart as soon as it's finished a run.

Changing it to:

```
highstate-schedule:
  schedule.present:
    - function: state.apply
    - seconds: 1800
    - splay: 30
```

Fixes up the Schedule:

```
      highstate-schedule:
        enabled: true
        function: state.apply
        jid_include: true
        maxrunning: 1
        name: highstate-schedule
        seconds: 1800
        splay: 30
```

... which works as expected. :-)
