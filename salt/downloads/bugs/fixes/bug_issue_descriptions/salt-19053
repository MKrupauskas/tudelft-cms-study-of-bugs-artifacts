I have a situation where I need to ensure that a path contains a real directory, but the current file.directory state cannot determine if it is a real directory or a symlink to a directory.

This is because python's os.path.isdir() method returns true for a symlinked directory too. I propose adding an 'allow_symlink' argument (probably set to True by default to not break existing sls files).

If allow_symlink is false, then it should check os.path.islink(), and if that returns true then it should remove the link and create the directory.

Alternatively, the existing force parameter could be used and a check made to os.path.islink() as well as os.path.isfile().
