I followed the instructions from here about how to setup a Windows build environment for Salt: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/windows.html

However, it fails with ValueError:

Inspecting the setup.py closely showed that a comma was missing from line 728:
            scripts.extend(['salt-cp = salt.scripts:salt_cp' <--- No comma!
Apparently, adding the comma fixed the issue:

Happy ending? :)
