### Description of Issue

When generating the XML for a VM that has a mix of disk buses using`virt.init`, the disk target names are not all starting from `a`.

For instance with the following disks is generating the following targets: `vda` and `hdb` instead of `vda` and `hda`.

```python
[
   {"name": "system", "pool": "default"},
    {
        "name": "tested",
        "device": "cdrom",
        "source_file": None,
        "model": "ide",
    },
]
```
