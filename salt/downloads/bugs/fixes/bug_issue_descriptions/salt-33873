### Description of Issue/Question

Hi, first of all this is a bug with Windows minions that appears to affect minions with version 2015.8.0+, and I believe this to be a regression introduced at the same time that winrepo-ng was introduced).

Specifically, I am trying to use  _refresh: True_ with the _pkg.latest_ state, but it's not working. pkg.installed won't work unless pkg.refresh_db has been ran first.
### Setup

Here is an example sls file

```
chrome installed:
   pkg.latest:
     - name: chrome
     - refresh: true
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

```
salt '011000' saltutil.clear_cache
salt '011000' state.apply chrome_managed
```

The eventual output includes the following

```
011000:
----------
          ID: chrome installed
    Function: pkg.latest
        Name: chrome
      Result: False
