The `salt/presence/present` event shows an empty list of present minions when you connect a minion that's behind a firewall with an IP that is NAT-ed. The presence event works correctly when the minion's IP is not NAT-ed.

Steps to recreate:
- Set up a salt master on AWS and add the following line to the master config:

```
presence_events: True
```
- Set up a salt minion on a network behind a firewall (if you set the minion up in AWS, you can point it to the external IP of the salt master to recreate the issue)
- Accept the salt minion's key on the master
- Listen for events on the master (`salt-run state.event pretty=True`). When you see presence events reported, present minions will be empty.
