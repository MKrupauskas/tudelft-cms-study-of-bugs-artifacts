Trying out the syntax found in http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/targeting/grains.html

```
# salt \* grains.item gpus
host1:
  gpus:
      {'model': 'GD 5446', 'vendor': 'unknown'}
host2:
  gpus:
      {'model': 'ES1000', 'vendor': 'ati'}
```

I try to do 

```
salt -G 'gpus:vendor:ati' test.ping
```

which doesn't return anything. Adding stars doesn't help. Am I doing something wrong ?
