### Description of Issue/Question

grains.setval doesn't set grains if the grain is set in `/etc/salt/minion`. It appears to be that restarting the minion has no effect.

For example:

```
sudo salt deploy-api-ylm1 grains.setval roles '[deploy-api]'
deploy-api-ylm1:
    ----------
    roles:
        - deploy-api
sudo salt deploy-api-ylm1 grains.get roles
deploy-api-ylm1:
```

The only way to I've been able to get it to work is to SSH into the minion and edit `/etc/salt/minion` to have:

```
grains:
  env: dev
  roles:
    - deploy-api
```
