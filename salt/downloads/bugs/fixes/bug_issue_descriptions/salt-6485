But it does connect to 4506.
I've had this before, and when I renamed the minion everything worked again. However, that is not an option this time...

From the minion, salt-minion -l trace:

```
[DEBUG   ] Attempting to authenticate with the Salt Master at 192.168.84.1
[DEBUG   ] Loaded minion key: /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem
[INFO    ] Waiting for minion key to be accepted by the master.
[DEBUG   ] Loaded minion key: /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pem
```

It just hangs there.

Oh, just discovered that restarting the master helps. 

However unhelpful this may be, I'll just leave it here anyway...
(0.16 all the way)
