### Description of Issue/Question

No warnings are given when using the wrong file.managed argument `file_mode`.  
The file.directory `file_mode` argument is easy to mix up with the file.managed `mode` argument when dealing with a large number of salt states.

It would be nice to have some helpful warning indicating this user error.  Something like:

```
    Warnings: The 'file_mode' argument will be ignored.  Please use 'mode'
              instead to set file permissions.
```

### Setup

```
Test File:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/testing
    - contents:
      - Example File State
    - file_mode: 0664
    - user: root
    - group: root
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

While managing a large number of salt states, it is easy to mix up the file.managed and file.directory arguments.  Adding the incorrect, 'file_mode' argument to a file.managed state will quietly ignore setting permissions properly.

With umask of 022, the resulting file permissions for the example salt state above will be 0644 instead of the expected 0664.
