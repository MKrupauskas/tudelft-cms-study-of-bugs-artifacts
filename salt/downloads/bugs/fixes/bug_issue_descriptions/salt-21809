If we enable gitfs (like in the documentation) and add a gitfs_remote which not exists we got for a simple command like `salt '*' saltutil.sync_all` the error:

```
[ERROR   ] Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased.
Failed to authenticate!  This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

If we fire a `salt '*' saltutil.running` saw that our triggered job is still running.

Our example setup looks like:
- 1 x master
- 2 x minions
  Every master / minion on a separate virtual machine on the same ESXi host.

Our configuration:

```
...
fileserver_backend:
 - git
 - roots

gitfs_provider: pygit2
gitfs_base: master

gitfs_remotes:
  - http://my.git.com/max/saltstack-grains.git
  - http://my.git.com/not/existing.git
...
```

If we remove `http://my.git.com/not/existing.git` from `gitfs_remotes` everything works fine.
