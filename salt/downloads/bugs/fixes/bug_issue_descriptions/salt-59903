**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I would like to make a feature request to make salt-runners scalable and be able to handle multiple concurrent requests from SSC.

It will help us in the following:
1. https://jira.eng.vmware.com/browse/SSC-50
2. Scale deploy minion api that gets called from VRA

For more context pls refer to my discussion with @dwoz  here:
