### Description of Issue/Question
While pkg.installed honors version=latest when a single package is given via name, it does not honor it for the pkgs list attribute.

### Setup
Given the following state:
```
base:
  pkg.installed:
    pkgs:
      - atop
      - bash: latest
```

This results in- at least for debian systems tested- a dpkg invocation of bash=latest, which isn't correct.
