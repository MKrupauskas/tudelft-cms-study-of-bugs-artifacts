### Description of Issue/Question

The `ssh_auth.present` state will happily insert an invalid ssh public key into the `authorized_keys` file, but since it's not valid it will not show up when listing keys for the user, causing it to be inserted every time the state is run. The "validation" that fails is invalid base64 padding, both cases I've had of this involved keys that had been truncated.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try to insert an invalid public key (invalid padding) with `ssh_auth.present` twice. Preferably it would not show up in `authorized_keys` at all, but instead it shows up twice.
