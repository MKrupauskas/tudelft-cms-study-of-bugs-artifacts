I have a state along the lines of

```
    somegroup:
      group.present:
        - members:
          - abc
          - def
```

When trying to run it, I get a failure that winds up ending with a backtrace like

```
            File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/group.py", line 154, in present
              __salt__['group.members'](name, ','.join(members))
            File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/lazy.py", line 90, in __getitem__
              raise KeyError(key)
          KeyError: 'group.members'
```

This is presumably because there is no 'members' function defined in modules/pw_group.py, and so doing this is actually unsupported on my platform.
