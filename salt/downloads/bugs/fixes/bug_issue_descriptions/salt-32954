### Description of Issue/Question

Hi all, every time I run glusterfs.peered for my 3 peers for the first time I get this error on first peer:

```
----------
          ID: glusterfs_peers
    Function: glusterfs.peered
        Name: 172.16.20.101
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1626, in call
                    **cdata['kwargs'])
                  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1492, in wrapper
                    return f(*args, **kwargs)
                  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/glusterfs.py", line 92, in peered                      if newpeers and name in newpeers or any([name in newpeers[x] for x in newpeers]):

     Changes:  

```

The other two peers passed correctly

The problem seems to be, that localhost (in this case node on 172.16.20.101) is not actually added as new peer and newpeers list in code is empty.

When I looked into this I also found out that former peers are not removed from the newpeer list in code so glusterfs.peered output is incorrect when adding new peers on node where some peers already existed. I'll tie pull request with this issue in a moment.
### Setup

Pillar

```
glusterfs:
    server:
        ----------
        peers:
            - 172.16.20.101
            - 172.16.20.102
            - 172.16.20.103
```

SLS

```
glusterfs_peers:
  glusterfs.peered:
    - names: {{ server.peers }}
    - require:
      - service: glusterfs_service
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Simply create pillar with at least 2 peers defined and run glusterfs.peered
