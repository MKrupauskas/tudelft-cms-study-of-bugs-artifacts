On the first highstate any custom grains are not available in the top file. Looking at the code it seems like the following happens in call_highstate:

Top file is compiled
sync_all is called with the environments from the top file
if new grains are syncd the pillar is re-compiled
Continues with rendering states etc.

Which means that the grains/pillar are potentially different for the top file rendering and the subsequent states. 

Would it be possible to re-compile the top file if the grains/pillar changed or perhaps it would be possible to sync extensions from a pre-configured environment upfront before any of this gets started.
