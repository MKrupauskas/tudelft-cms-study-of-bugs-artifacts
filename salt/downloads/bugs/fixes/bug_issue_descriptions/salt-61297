### Description of Issue
I am evaluating the deltaproxy feature released on 3004 version and noticed the configuration settings for other deltaproxy managed minions are getting overridden with the settings defined for the last minion defined under "ids". This results in cases like targeting one minion to execute a command and getting the result from another one. This behaviour was originally observed for napalm and netmiko proxies and, to make sure it's nothing related to my environment, I brought up a fresh 3004 instance with 1 deltaproxy and 3 dummy proxies. Details below:

### Setup
_/etc/salt/master_:
```
interface: 127.0.0.1
```

_/etc/salt/proxy_:
```
master: 127.0.0.1
metaproxy: deltaproxy
enable_fqdns_grains: False
multiprocessing: True
```

_/srv/pillar/top.sls_:
```
base:
  deltaproxy:
    - deltaproxy
  dummy1:
    - dummy1
  dummy2:
   - dummy2
  dummy3:
   - dummy3
```

_/srv/pillar/deltaproxy.sls_:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: deltaproxy
  ids:
    - dummy1
    - dummy2
    - dummy3
```

_/srv/pilar/dummy1.sls_:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: dummy
  hostname: dummy1
```

_/srv/pilar/dummy2.sls_:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: dummy
  hostname: dummy2
```

_/srv/pilar/dummy3.sls_:
```
proxy:
  proxytype: dummy
  hostname: dummy3
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Here it's possible to observe that _id_ and also settings defined under _pillar_ are overridden:
```
root@salt-3004:~# salt 'dummy*' config.get id
dummy1:
    dummy3
dummy2:
    dummy3
dummy3:
    dummy3

root@salt-3004:~# salt 'dummy*' config.get proxy
dummy1:
    ----------
    hostname:
        dummy3
    proxytype:
        dummy
dummy2:
    ----------
    hostname:
        dummy3
    proxytype:
        dummy
dummy3:
    ----------
    hostname:
        dummy3
    proxytype:
        dummy
```
