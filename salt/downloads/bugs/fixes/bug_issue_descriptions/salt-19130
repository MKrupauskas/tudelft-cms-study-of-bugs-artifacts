I wrote a grain like this:

```
def megaraidinfo():
[...]
  return {megaraidinfo: respdata}
```

Note missing "" around dict key: a typo, of course. This ended up crashing the minion when I ran saltutil.sync_grains(), and it can't start anymore, because, well, it crashes while executing the grain ;)

This is the trace:

```

This is salt 2014.1.13. I'm not blaming anyone, but it would be nice if it wouldn't have crashed.
