I get no output for the following command:

```
# salt-run pillar.show_top <host>
#
```

I would have expected to see the data generated from top.sls in my pillar git repo. I have no file pillars. I only have pillars from git. Here's the relevant part of my /etc/salt/master config:

```
ext_pillar:
  - git: master git+ssh://git@gitserver.example.com/sf-pillar.git
```

Here's my version info:

```
