Hello,

As per the documentation, the cloud softlayer integration seems to lack the ability to specify multiple disks for a VM when creating it. SL allows a maximum of 5 disks to be present, however the salt.cloud.clouds.softlayerprovider only allows a single disk size to be specified.

the python SL API also treats this as a list, so it's implemented there.

Please allow multiple disks to be created with a VM.
