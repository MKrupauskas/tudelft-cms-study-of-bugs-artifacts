The `cron.file` state is broken on 2016.3.0 and 2016.3.1, a regression introduced by an extra argument on get_managed().

Error:
`Unable to manage file: get_managed() takes exactly 11 arguments (10 given)`

It was fixed by https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/32396. Can the fix be included in 2016.3.2?
