### Description of Issue/Question
### Setup

Using a state file similar to the following works unless it's an update:

openstack-neutronpkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - skip_suggestions: True
    - pkgs:
      - openstack-neutron: {{ pillar['pkgs']['openstack-neutron'] }}
      - openstack-neutron-common: {{ pillar['pkgs']['openstack-neutron-common'] }}
      - openstack-neutron-ml2: {{ pillar['pkgs']['openstack-neutron-ml2'] }}
      - python-neutron: {{ pillar['pkgs']['python-neutron'] }}

Where pillar information for these packages looks like so:

pkgs:
  openstack-neutron: 1:7.0.3-1.el7
  openstack-neutron-common: 1:7.0.3-1.el7
  openstack-neutron-linuxbridge: 1:7.0.3-1.el7
  openstack-neutron-ml2: 1:7.0.3-1.el7
  python-neutron: 1:7.0.3-1.el7

Previously, on the OpenStack Liberty release, these were version '1:7.0.1-1.el7', and the version installed on the applicable OpenStack servers.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Define in pillar a version for a package that has the epoch on it.  Perhaps choose an older package or one that you know has an update for it and confirm the older version is currently installed on the minion.  Update the pillar information to utilize the new version and issue a highstate for the minion.  You'll get an error like so:

```
      ID: openstack-neutronpkgs
Function: pkg.installed
  Result: False
 Comment: The following packages failed to install/update: openstack-neutron-common=1:7.0.3-1.el7, openstack-neutron=1:7.0.3-1.el7, openstack-neutron-ml2=1:7.0.3-1.el7, python-neutron=1:7.0.3-1.el7 The following packages were already installed: python-novaclient=1:2.30.1-1.el7, which, python-neutronclient=3.1.0-1.el7
 Started: 17:18:59.393256
Duration: 3662.715 ms
 Changes:
```

However, if I go and manually update these, and then issue a salt-call state.highstate on the minion or similar from the master, it's fine.  If I remove the RPM completely and do the highstate, it'll work too, just updating will fail.
