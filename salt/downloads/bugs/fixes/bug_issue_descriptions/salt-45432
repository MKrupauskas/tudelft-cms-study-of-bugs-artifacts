### Description of Issue/Question
@twangboy  @damon-atkins I think there is a general fault or corruption in the official winrepo-ng software definition files repo that keeps them from compiling. ( or is it just on my system? and I need to clear a somehow cached 'bad' repo db ? )

So as a consequence of that ```NO``` ```pkg.refresh_db``` or ```pkg.list_upgrades``` or ```pkg.install``` or ```pkg.remove``` cmd works.

This looks and acts very much like back in Nov 2016 when issue  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/37669 was breaking the official repo with  a single new malformed sls file. I know lots has been done to prevent this from happening, but it looks to me as if a very similar thing has happened again.

### Setup
This happens on centos 7 linux, master or windows minions all running 2017.7.2 (Nitrogen)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
salt my_win_minion pkg.refresh_db
mywin_minion:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\minion.py", line 1470, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\executors\direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\win_pkg.py", line 605, in refresh_db
        return genrepo(saltenv=saltenv, verbose=verbose, failhard=failhard)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\win_pkg.py", line 761, in genrepo
        successful_verbose
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\win_pkg.py", line 829, in _repo_process_pkg_sls
        for pkgname, versions in six.iteritems(config):
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\ext\six.py", line 606, in iteritems
        return d.iteritems(**kw)
    AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
```

(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
