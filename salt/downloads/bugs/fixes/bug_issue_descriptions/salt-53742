### Description of Issue
The Salt API call `/events` gives access to the salt event stream. The Salt API has a session timeout (parameter `token_expire`). However, after a session timeout on the API, the event stream remains active. This may technically be correct, but still information is retrieved after the session timeout.

### Setup
Set up Salt API.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run salt-api service.
Request an event stream using `/events`.
Consume or ignore the events.
The stream continues after a session timeout.
