### Description of Issue/Question
The win_path.exists documentation has an example with `index=0`, which presumably should append at the very start of the PATH, like the underlying win_path.add function. However, the state has this condition:

[`if index:`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/b6079e2b71a2f0fb508c0d8459dad35fe9fdd329/salt/states/win_path.py#L99)

So `index=0` is always handled the same as the default `index=None`, so it will always append instead of prepend.

### Setup / Steps to Reproduce Issue
You can use this state from the documentation, then verify that it has been added at the end:
```
'C:\\sysinternals':
  win_path.exists:
    - index: 0
```
