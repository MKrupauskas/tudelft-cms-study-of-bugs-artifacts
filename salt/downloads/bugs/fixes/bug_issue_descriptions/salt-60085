**Description**
State for pip.installed fails with python exception 

State is this:

salthelpers-scripts-upgrade-global-packages:
  pip.installed:
    - names:
      - awscli >= 1.11.34
      - boto3 >= 1.4.1
    - upgrade: True

OS: Ubuntu 20.04
Salt ver: 3003 , installed from official PPA.
See detailed salt versions in the end of the report.

Error is:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not reversible
as below:

File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/states/pip_state.py", line 324, in _check_if_installed
                  for version in reversed(available_versions):
              TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not reversible


**Setup**
State that fails is described above.


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Create SLS with state above and apply it.
(I applied with salt-call --local state.highstate,
However, I'm pretty sure you can apply just this particular state 
and you will shall get same issue).

You will get this output for the state:

ID: salthelpers-scripts-upgrade-global-packages
    Function: pip.installed
        Name: boto3 >= 1.4.1
      Result: False

    Duration: 1212.3 ms
     Changes:

There will be one more output for aws-cli but almost identical to shown above.

I'm able to workaround the bug by adding option:
  - force_reinstall: True
 
This makes code going different route and this particular bug does not trigger.
However, I do not feel it's good idea to do the workaround everywhere.

**Expected behavior**
Expected behavior is to have state successful with Result: True

**Additional context**
May be I'm missing something simple, because bug seems shall be discovered by many people
but I did not find anything new and relevant by googling.
