I'm reopening the issue we discovered in #37580 with a minimal reproducer. \cc @isbm

# Setup
* on the 1st system: salt-master, salt-ssh in version 2016.3.4 or 2015.8.7
* on the 2nd system: `sshd` configured & running

# Steps to reproduce:
On the 1st system:
1. File roots base /srv/salt:
Relevant portion of master config:
```
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/
```

2. Roster
```
myhost:
  host: myhostfqdn
  user: root
  passwod: mypass
```

3. Create a custom module in /srv/salt/_modules/mymodule.py with the following contents:
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import absolute_import

import logging
import salt.modules.cmdmod

__salt__ = {
    'cmd.run_all': salt.modules.cmdmod.run_all,
}

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def __virtual__():
    return True

def get_me_stuff():
    result = {"status": "ok"}
    return result
```

4. Create a state using the module above in /srv/salt/my/state.sls
```
state:
  module.run:
      - name: mymodule.get_me_stuff
```

5. Proceed as follows (on the "master")
* `salt-ssh -i myhost state.apply my.state` -> succeeds
* `salt-ssh -i myhost saltutil.sync_modules` -> empty output
* `salt-ssh -i myhost state.apply my.state` -> fails now

The last command fails, until we delete the extracted thin in the temp of the
target system (`-w` parameter as suggested in the older issue doesn't help). After the 1st command execution, the `mymodule.py` is present in extracted thin on the target system, but running `sync_modules` deletes it and it's not copied again by running the last state.apply.
