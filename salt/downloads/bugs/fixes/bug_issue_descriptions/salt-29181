If salt state cron.file is used with a static cron file, each call to an existing cron with no changes to cron will fail with:

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1591, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/cron.py", line 534, in file
                  if cron_ret['retcode']:
              UnboundLocalError: local variable 'cron_ret' referenced before assignment
```

This happens because, at line mentioned in error message, there is a condition check on `cron_ret['retcode']` at line 534 which is only available if `ret['changes']` condition on line 526 is true

current workaround will be:
- make the cron file on salt master a template and include some change (like a current timestamp)
