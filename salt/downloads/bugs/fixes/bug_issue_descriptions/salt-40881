### Description of Issue/Question

We migrated from 2015.8 to 2016.11 and found an backward incompatible problem
caused by this condition https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/softlayer.py#L403

With 2015.8 we did not use **public_vlan** parameter at all but 2016.11 *requires* it.
So we have a lot of nodes in different locations and collecting all public vlan ids across all location is time consuming and as for me useless because softlayer itself does not require it!

Workaround for now - remove public_vlan from condition.

### Setup
provider
```
#SoftLayer
sl:
  user: SLXXXXX
  apikey: ertrskjdfsldkfsdnf,smdf,.smdf.,smd.,fms.,dmfksjdlkflsdm
  driver: softlayer
```

profile
```
sl-CENTOS_7_64-dal09-2core-4096MB-RAM-100GB-DISK:
  provider: sl
  image: CENTOS_7_64 #CentOS 7 64bit
  cpu_number: 2
  ram: 4096
  disk_size: 100
  location: dal09
  local_disk: True
  hourly_billing: True
  domain: example.com
  max_net_speed: 1000
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
sudo salt-cloud -p sl-CENTOS_7_64-dal09-2core-4096MB-RAM-100GB-DISK stats-sl-test.example.com
```
