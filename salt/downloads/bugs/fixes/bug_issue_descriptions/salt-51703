### Description of Issue/Question
The Salt Minion on Windows don't work when a proprietary 'man' executable is in the path.
It seems that the method has_feature_flags() in \salt\utils\zfs.py tries to execute a 'man' even on Windows.
According to the header of the file this code is only for 'illumos,freebsd,linux'

### Setup
Add a man.bat to the Windows System Path with one line like:
TIMEOUT /T -1

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt 'testhost' test.ping 
will give:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
