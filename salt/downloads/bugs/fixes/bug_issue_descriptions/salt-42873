### Description of Issue/Question
The Salt Minion on Server 2016 and Windows 10 does not seem to think osquery is installed. When I run any osquery module from Salt to a Windows minion, the following is returned instead of the actual data:
```
    data:
    result:
        True
```
osquery.version returns "None". I don't recall having this issue in the past. Is it possible that there is some formatting option or any other that I have missed?

When I run osquery locally on the Windows system, the data is returned as expected.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the osquery module with the 2017.7.0 release for the Salt Master and then a Salt Minion on a Server 2016 or Windows 10 system. All of the options in the osquery modules that I've passed have replicated the issue: salt _minion-name_ osquery.query "select * from drivers;" or salt _minion-name_ osquery.usb_devices

### Versions Report
The minion and the master are both on Salt 2017.7.0. The minions are running 2017.7.0/Python3 on Server 2016 (don't have the build handy at the moment but it'll be the current) and Windows 10 (1607, build 14393.1198).
