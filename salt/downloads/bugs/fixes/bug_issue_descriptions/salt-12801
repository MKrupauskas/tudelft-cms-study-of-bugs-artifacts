Hi,
The OpenStack cloud I'm using returns no data for 'public_ips', only 'private_ips'.
This is usable with the settings `ssh_interface: 'private_ips'` in the cloud provider settings.
However, it fails on destroy with `delete_sshkeys` enabled:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 163, in run
    ret = mapper.destroy(names, cached=True)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/__init__.py", line 895, in destroy
    ret = self.clouds[fun](name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/libcloudfuncs.py", line 387, in destroy
    salt.utils.cloud.remove_sshkey(node.public_ips[0])
IndexError: list index out of range
```

Someone who knows the code well should be able to just transfer the existing public/private logic to the ssh key delete function, I think.

Of course, it is entirely possible I missed some configuration and this is not a bug, in which case please help and close the issue.

Thanks!
