Scenario:
I'm running salt on multiple LXC containers. Out of the box on Ubuntu 14.04 an LXC container will not get useful results out of dmidecode nor are they really needed about a virtual container;

```
artanicus@mailer ~ %> sudo dmidecode
# dmidecode 2.12
# SMBIOS entry point at 0x000f04c0
/dev/mem: Operation not permitted
```

If I want to keep my monitoring at loglevel WARNING this becomes an issue;

```
artanicus@mailer ~ %> sudo /usr/bin/salt-call --out=quiet -l warning state.highstate
[WARNING ] Although 'dmidecode' was found in path, the current user cannot execute it. Grains output might not be accurate.
[WARNING ] Although 'dmidecode' was found in path, the current user cannot execute it. Grains output might not be accurate.
```

Would it be possible to handle this somehow slightly more gracefully? e.g. have a config option for disabling dmidecode? I could just uninstall it but will get pulled in again due to the Recommends from the salt-minion debian package. All ways of fixing this I can think of are flawed in some way.
