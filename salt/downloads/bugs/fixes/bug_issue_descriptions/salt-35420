### Description of Issue/Question

run_on_start seems to be unsupported on on salt.states.schedule

It seems only to be supported when defining schedules via pillar data

(On a side note, defining schedules from pillar data requires minions to restart (?)... so I prefer to define schedules in states, where schedule changes take immediate effect)
### Setup

Define a state such as this:

```
my_highstate:
  schedule.present:
    - function: my_function
    - run_on_start: False
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Apply the state and list the schedule... run_on_start won't be disabled on the job.
