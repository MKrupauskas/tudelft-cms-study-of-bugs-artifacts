 After upgrading any system with "salt <id> pkg.upgrade", the salt-minion service is dead (stopped). From what I remember, this has never worked for me in the past. However this time I doug a bit deeper.

The salt-minion package does a "service salt-minion condrestart" in the %postun section in the case of an upgrade. The condrestart finally invokes "start", which tests whether a process with the name salt-minion is running

...
if [ $(pidofproc $PROCESS) ]; then
            RETVAL=$?
            echo -n "already running"
        else
...

The last bit is where it goes wrong. From what I've seen salt-minion spawns a child process leaving us with at least two processes named salt-minion and the if statement is evaluating to true.
Long story short the condrestart successfully stops the running minion but does not start a new one since it believes there is already one running (the spawned process).
