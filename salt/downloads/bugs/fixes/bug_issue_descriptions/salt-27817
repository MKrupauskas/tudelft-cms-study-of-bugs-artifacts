I configured the order masters and tornado api ,but using an error
I use the architect is  master - syndic - minion
I want to start the rest interface in the master to control the minion ,trying to use rest_tornado with a syndic setup

[tornado.application][ERROR   ][24274] Future exception was never retrieved: TimeoutException

Where is the timeout configuration, please
Use no problem on the master,Just use an error in the order master
