After upgrading our master to 2018.3.0 from 2017.7.2, pillar_ldap quit working properly.  Every time it tried to reference the pillar, we would get this error in the logs 
```

```

I'm not sure what would have changed, whether something in parsing pillar_ldap.yaml, or something in pillar_ldap itself.  Whatever has happened, python-ldap is not happy getting a unicode type in the attribute list.  

This is on a CentOS system using python-ldap-2.4.15-2.el7.x86_64

In the meantime, without knowing what a proper fix would be, I have worked around the problem with:
