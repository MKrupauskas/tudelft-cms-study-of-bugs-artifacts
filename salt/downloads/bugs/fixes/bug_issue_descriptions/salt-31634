### Description of Issue/Question

Running two instances of `salt-cloud` appears to clause the cache to be damaged.
### Setup

Provider is EC2.

two profiles, each in separate VPCs and stuff - but I dont think this is important, I think it's simply concurrent `salt-cloud` commands.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

in one terminal run `salt-cloud -m /some/map/file/here -P` and in a second on the same salt master run `salt-cloud -m /some/other/map/file -P`

The first instance may or may not complete - mine hung, however the second instance died with this output.

After this all `salt-cloud` commands die with the following

```

Removing `/var/cache/salt/cloud/` and running `salt-cloud -F` seems to restore balance to the force.
