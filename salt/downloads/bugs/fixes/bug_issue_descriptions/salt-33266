### Description of Issue/Question

When calling `grains.items` on my servers, I always got exact string describing `manufacturer` such as `Dell Inc.`, or `HP`. But on my new servers, `grains.items` returns string with comments, like:

```
    manufacturer:
        # SMBIOS implementations newer than version 2.7 are not
        # fully supported by this version of dmidecode.
        Dell Inc.
```

Should `SaltStack` processes this comments automatically?
### Setup

```
# uname -a
Linux xxx 2.6.32-220.7.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Mar 7 00:52:02 GMT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
# salt 'xxx' grains.items 2>&1|grep manufacturer -A5 -B2
    machine_id:
        xxx
    manufacturer:
        # SMBIOS implementations newer than version 2.7 are not
        # fully supported by this version of dmidecode.
        Dell Inc.
    master:
        xxx
```
