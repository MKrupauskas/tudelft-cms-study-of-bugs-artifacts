Fell into a weird error using salt-ssh 

```
/bin/sh: 70: /tmp/.salt/salt-call: Permission denied

Permission denied for host 192.168.0.19, do you want to deploy the salt-ssh key? (password required):
[Y/n]
```

After some debugging I found that python was to installed on the destination host. I know this is quite rare, but it happens, a specific error message should be displayed. 

Maybe here : 

``` bash

      for py_candidate in \
            python27      \
            python2.7     \
            python26      \
            python2.6     \
            python2       \
            python        ;
      do
         if [ $(which $py_candidate 2>/dev/null) ]
         then
               PYTHON=$(which $py_candidate)
               break
         fi
      done
```
