I have two conflicting states:

```
/var/lib/subversion:
  file.directory:
    - group: svn
    - dir_mode: 700
    - file_mode: 640
    - recurse:
      - group
    - require:
      - user: user-svn
    - exclude_pat: "*.ssh*"
```

and another that sets the group of the .ssh dir to something else.

This is the output:

```
svn:
----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /var/lib/subversion/.ssh
    Function:  directory
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Directory /var/lib/subversion/.ssh updated
        Changes:   mode: 700

----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /var/lib/subversion
    Function:  directory
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Directory /var/lib/subversion updated
        Changes:   mode: 700
```

Note the two `mode: 700`s. I think there should be a group in there...

Confused the hell out of me until I set the mode of the above state to 700, first I thought it was recursing the mode as well even though it is not set in recurse.
