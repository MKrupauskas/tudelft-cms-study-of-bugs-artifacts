When following the documentation, it mentions that you should update the master first, and things should work, unless there had been a major security problem.  After checking the changelog where I didn't see any warnings, I updated the master, but things broke.

When the minion tries to to run, I get this:
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', *\* skipped *\* latest already in cache 'salt://top.sls'
Passed invalid arguments: 'bool' object is not iterable

Running a master v2014.1.4 out of git fixes the problem, or updating the minion works too.  The result was a little surprising, so I'm opening the issue in case this shouldn't be happening.
