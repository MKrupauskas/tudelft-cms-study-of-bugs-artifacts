In order to keep my master config lean & clean I am using separate files in master.d. This however appears not to be working 100%, at a startup of Salt-master:

```

[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/master

```

... Some other stuff ...

```

```

The last part is going on for quite a long time. Same with this:

```
[DEBUG   ] Guessing ID. The id can be explicitly in set /etc/salt/minion
[INFO    ] Found minion id from getfqdn(): my.hostname.tld
```

this is also occurring many (maybe a hundred or even more) times. 
This lengthens the startup process quite a  bit.
