Based on [this question](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/pKt_1m9Y40Q).

There is no known way to override `test: True` option from Salt minion config file `/etc/salt/minion` on command line using `orchestrate` runner.
## Example

Example `orchestrate` state in `/srv/salt/whatever.sls`:

```
    whatever_example:
        salt.state:
            - tgt: 'minion_id'
            - highstate: True
```
## Failed approach 1

Overriding default on the command line using `test=False` does not work with orchestrate runner (there are many `result: None` in the output due to test mode):

```
salt-run -l all state.orchestrate whatever test=False
```
## Failed approach 2

It is also not possible to override default config `test: True` inside `orchestrate` state above - this won't work:

```
    whatever_example:
        salt.state:
            - tgt: 'minion_id'
            - highstate: True
            - test: False
```
