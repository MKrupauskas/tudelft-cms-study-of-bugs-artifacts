## Issue

With the latest version of salt, a salt-call fails when we have:

```
providers:
  pkg: pkgng
```

specified in /usr/local/etc/salt/minion

Output of the failure:

```
# salt-call state.sls pkgng
[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/zfs -?' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

```
## Impact

This is an issue with our 9.1-RELEASE systems, we are a full pkgng environment with our own build cluster.

We can not run any highstates or individual states now. We are moving away from 9.x to 10.x, but we are not there yet.
