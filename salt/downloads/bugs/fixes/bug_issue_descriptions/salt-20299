I just upgraded from salt 2014.1.0 to salt 2014.7.0 and found that the way minion_Id is generated has changed. The new version calls geneate_minion_id() in salt.utils.network to determine the proper name. In suse11, /etc/hosts has:

```
# special IPv6 addresses
::1             localhost ipv6-localhost ipv6-loopback
```

However, ipv6-loopback/localhost are not part of the punish list in _sort_hostnames(). 

Worth adding those two entries to the punish list?
