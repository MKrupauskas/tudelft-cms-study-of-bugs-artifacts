When using salt with vagrant the pyobjects renderer doesn't seem to behave the same when bootstrapping as when running regularly.

I do a bunch of things in salt states but the final file contains these:

```
...
# use pip to reinstall pip with the very latest version
Pip.installed(
    'pip',
    bin_env='/opt/myproject/env',
    user='myproject',
    upgrade=True,
    require=[
        Virtualenv('virtualenv-myproject')
    ]
)

Pip.installed(
    'pip install requirements.txt',
    bin_env='/opt/myproject/env',
    requirements='/opt/myproject/requirements.txt',
    user='myproject',
    upgrade=True,
    require=[
        Git('poswald/myproject'),
        Virtualenv('virtualenv-myproject'),
        Pip('pip'),
        Pkg('libsqlite3-dev'),
    ]
)
```

I get this error when running `vagrant up` with a fresh vm and using the vagrant/salt bootstrap mechanism in the Vagrantfile basically [as described in their docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/salt.html):

```
[CRITICAL] Rendering SLS myproject failed, render error: name 'Pip' is not defined
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 2465, in render_state
    sls, rendered_sls=mods
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/template.py", line 84, in compile_template
    ret = render(input_data, saltenv, sls, **render_kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/renderers/pyobjects.py", line 449, in render
    exec final_template in _globals
  File "<string>", line 79, in <module>
NameError: name 'Pip' is not defined
```

I can then `vagrant ssh` into the vm and run `sudo salt-call state.highstate` which gives me this:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Rendering SLS myproject failed, render error: name 'Pip' is not defined

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 2465, in render_state

    ret = render(input_data, saltenv, sls, **render_kwargs)

    exec final_template in _globals
  File "<string>", line 79, in <module>
NameError: name 'Pip' is not defined

```

So it seems like the syntax is wrong. But... if I then comment out those two `Pip` objects, run highstate to get set up and then un-comment them back in, it works:

```
...

```

So, it seems that something is not set up in the bootstrapped environment that is set up once it has successfully run. Any idea what is going on here?

I also tried doing it with the state object name as `PipState` (as that's how it is documented) which seemed to work for the bootstrapping step but then later failed to run. Not sure if that is somehow related or not.
