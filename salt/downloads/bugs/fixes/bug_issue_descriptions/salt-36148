### Description of Issue/Question

Running salt-api commands from clients does not work if salt-master has ACLs based on ldap groups.
with the following config i can call salt-api with no issues:

```
external_auth:
  pam:
    some_user:
      - '@wheel'
```

however if I configure them using groups:

```
external_auth:
  pam:
    some_group%:
      - '@wheel'
```

Then salt-api just tells me it can't authenticate me.
However, with groups or single users i can run "salt -a pam '*' some.command", it's just salt-api that's having issues.

I can't create the groups on the client before, I need to call salt-api to create a key for the minion, then call a state to connect it to LDAP to fetch all the groups+users.
### Setup

Salt master configured with eauth to openLDAP.
Salt-api is configured with cherrypy.
