### Description of Issue
When running salt.state.docker_image.present the container being built has the host's pillar and grains instead of the container's. This is mostly an issue for detecting if the state is being run in a container via grains.virtual_subtype.

### Setup
```
{% if grains.virtual_subtype is defined and grains.virtual_subtype == "Docker" %}
it-works-as-expected:
  test.succeed_without_changes:
    - name: "Running inside of a docker container"
{% else %}
it-doesnt-work:
  test.fail_without_changes:
    - name: "Detected as not running inside of docker even though it is"
{% endif %}
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
docker-doesnt-work-as-expected:
  docker_image.present:
    - name: pleasefix
    - tag: lovesalt
    - sls: theabovestate
    - base: fedora
```
