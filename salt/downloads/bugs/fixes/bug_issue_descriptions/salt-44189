### Description of Issue/Question

Using `postgres_extension.present` will always report changes that needs to be applied in test mode (`test=true`) due to premature checks in the code.
The code at
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/postgres_extension.py#L124 
will cause salt to always report changes as it only checks if `test=true` is set.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
