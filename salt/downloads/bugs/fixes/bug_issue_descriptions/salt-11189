This looks very similar to issue #9158, except that I'm not using a renderer:

```
----------
    State: - cmd
    Name:      oracle_jre
    Function:  script
        Result:    False
        Comment:   Unable to cache script salt://file_roots/states/oracle_jre/install_oracle_jre.sh from env 'None'
        Changes:   cache_error: True
                   pid: 0
                   retcode: 1
                   stderr:
                   stdout:
```

Honestly, this error message tells me nothing. Everything looks suspiciously right, but the problem here is that `install_oracle_jre.sh` can't be found. Something like "Unable to find script `salt://file_roots/states/oracle_jre/install_oracle_jre.sh` in any environment." would be helpful; perhaps even "in any of these environments: ["base", "my_env"]" (in my case). Perhaps even a list of attempted file paths: this would make my issue very obvious, as I'd get:

```
/stuff/file_roots/file_roots/states/oracle_jre/install_oracle_jre.sh
              ^^^^^^^ there's my problem.
```
