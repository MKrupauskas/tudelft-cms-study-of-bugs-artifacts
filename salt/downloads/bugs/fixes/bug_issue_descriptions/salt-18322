Slightly odd one this... We are upgrading from 2014.1.13 to 2014.7.0 in a multi-master environment. We've upgraded 3 of 600 minions to test (1RHEL5/2RHEL6) and all have exhibited the issue below: 

With `multiprocessing: True` as is set by default, the minions successfully connect to both master servers, receive commands from both masters successfully **but** the return's only ever seem to work with one of the two masters. 

For example, running a test.ping from master01 will show a return, running from master02 times out. The minion's log shows both masters as being connected and shows the results of the command as being sent off to the salt master. 

We've spent a while looking at this and started grabbing as straws, one of these was to disable multiprocessing. Once that's done then the minion successfully reports to both masters. 

I suspect this is just highlighting the root cause in a different light but were quite stuck with this and it's quite urgent for us. Disabling multiprocessing doesn't really work with our work flows.
