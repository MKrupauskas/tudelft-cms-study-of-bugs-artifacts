The following state gave us a headache today:

```
/etc/zookeeper/conf/myid:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ "2" }}
    - require:
      - pkg: zookeeper
```

Which resulted in this error:

```
----------
          ID: /etc/zookeeper/conf/myid
    Function: file.managed
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1533, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/file.py", line 1276, in managed
                  if contents and not contents.endswith('\n'):

     Started: 23:00:05.381614

```

Which is weird because the contents is a string. Really.
Workaround is to explicitly disable newline addition:

```
/etc/zookeeper/conf/myid:
  file.managed:
    - contents: {{ "2" }}
    - contents_newline: False
    - require:
      - pkg: zookeeper
```
