If you forget to delete a minion from your salt-key's the master will progressively build up in cpu usage. I ran into this issue because I was testing some new servers which I added to my main salt cluster. After testing I got rid of the servers but I forgot to remove their salt keys from the master.

I assume the salt master is continuously trying to contact them. Perhaps some exponential backoff logic would fix this?
