### Description of Issue
If I run an orchestration with `salt.runner` notation and with `test=True` I get the following:
https://gist.github.com/Oloremo/5a1ab1f0dad78a62c920b0d8229cc265

To make it even worse - it has an exit code `0`.

Running the same with `test=False` works as expected. 

### Setup
My orchestration:
```
orch.runner.java:
  salt.runner:
      - name: state.orchestrate
      - parallel: False
      - kwarg:
          mods: orch/services/java
```

`orch/services/java`:
```
orch.java.install:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: '*'
    - sls:
      - formula.java
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Create the orchestration with `salt.runner` and run it with `test=True`.
