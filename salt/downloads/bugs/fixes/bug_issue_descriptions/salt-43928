### Description of Issue/Question
When using the salt virt runner to deploy a new vm to a KVM host, like so:

`salt-run virt.init mynewminion 1 1024 /var/lib/libvirt/images/image.qcow2 nic=nicprofile host='kvmhost'`

The preseeding of the minion fails with the following exception:

```
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1468, in _thread_return
        return_data = executor.execute()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 28, in execute
        return self.func(*self.args, **self.kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/virt.py", line 691, in init
        __salt__[seed_cmd](
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1113, in __getitem__
        func = super(LazyLoader, self).__getitem__(item)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/lazy.py", line 96, in __getitem__
        if self._load(key):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1578, in _load
        raise KeyError
    KeyError
```
The debug log of the minion shows the following lines:
```
[DEBUG   ] Generating VM XML
[DEBUG   ] Seed command is False
[WARNING ] The minion function caused an exception
```

If we however use the following salt command, seeding succeed but the minion-key is not automatically accepted on the master.

`salt 'kvmhost' virt.init mynewminion 1 1024 image=/var/lib/libvirt/images/image.qcow2 nic=nicprofile`

The debug log shows the following lines:
```
[DEBUG   ] Generating VM XML
[DEBUG   ] Seed command is seed.apply
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded seed.apply
```
After which guestmount is used to do the preseeding.

It seems the Salt runner needs to be told to use `seed.apply` as the seed command.
