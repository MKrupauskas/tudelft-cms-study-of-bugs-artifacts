Hey all, I have a state that looks something like this:

``` yaml
unzip:
  pkg.installed

http_proxy:
  environ.setenv:
    - value: 'http://proxy-url'

https_proxy:
  environ.setenv:
    - value: 'https://proxy-url'

/usr/local/bin/consul_dir:
  archive.extracted:
    - source: https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/consul/0.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
    - archive_format: zip
    - source_hash: sha256=161f2a8803e31550bd92a00e95a3a517aa949714c19d3124c46e56cfdc97b088
    - require:
        - environ: http_proxy
        - environ: https_proxy
        - pkg: unzip
```

where `proxy-url` is a standin for the actual url of my http proxy. With a 2014.7 minion the archive extracted fine, with a  2015.5 minion, I get:

``` yaml
----------
          ID: /usr/local/bin/consul_dir
    Function: archive.extracted
      Result: False
     Comment: Unable to manage file: [Errno 111] Connection refused

Debugging with salt-call, this appears to be happening [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.5/salt/utils/http.py#L286), it looks like the new utils.http doesn't use the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables, whereas whatever was responsible for the http calls in 2014.7 did.
