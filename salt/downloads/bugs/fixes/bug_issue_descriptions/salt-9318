I'm using salt-cloud to deploy a map file that consist 6 VMs, if I used the parallel flag, it fails at the SSH step (right when it tries to execute the date command on the minion). Now, if I removed the -P flag, then it works perfectly.

I simplified the case to just 1 VM, and still has the same issue, also it doesn't matter if I use passwords, or ssh keys, still the same issue. Also, during the time it tries 15 times to SSH, I copied the ssh command it uses, from the debug trace, and I was able to get the date from the instance as expected.

This seems to be a regression. Standalone salt-cloud (v0.8.11) works fine.

I think I've narrowed it down to vt.py, and it's one of the things that change during the merge between salt and salt-cloud, previously it used the NonBlockingPopen class.
