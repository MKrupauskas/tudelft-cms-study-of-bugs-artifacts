**Description**
I have an issue with adding config using Salt to my cisco routers 7200 in GNS3.

**Setup**
I am using this command to do it               sudo salt router2 net.load_config text='ntp server 1.1.1.1'


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
And getting this error:  Cannot execute "compare_config" on 10.0.1.6 as matej. Reason: Netmiko _autodetect_fs failed (to workaround specify dest_file_system in optional_args.)!


So, please if someone would know where exactly dest_file_system arg should be added and what value should it have. I have tried to specify it in pillar file with values flash, flash0, disk0, ios, nvram but none of them worked.
