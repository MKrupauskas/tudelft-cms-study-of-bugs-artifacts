### Description of Issue/Question

pygit seems to be ignoring the passphrase when trying to communicate to a git repository over ssh.

I have tried this using both the global `gitfs_passphrase` and the target based `passphrase` options.

Additionally, if I left the passphrase set, but removed it from the ssh key, then it worked.  This indicates that the passphrase isn't being used at all, because that should have error'd.
### Setup

```
sudo apt-get install cmake python-dev python-pip \

tar xzf v0.24.1.tar.gz
