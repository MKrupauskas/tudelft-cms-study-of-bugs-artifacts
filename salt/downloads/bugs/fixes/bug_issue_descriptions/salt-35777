### Description of Issue/Question

There were deprecation warnings in `salt/utils/__init__.py` to change the warnings around passing extra data as key:value pairs to raising a SaltInvocationError. When this removal was made in #35712, many test failures happened on develop in important areas (such as rest_cherrypi and wheel client tests). 

In order to avoid bad regressions on the Carbon feature release, the removal was reverted in #35770 and the deprecation release version was bumped back one feature release cycle to Nitrogen in #35776.

The code needs to be audited more carefully to avoid test failures and regressions in other areas that tests might not be catching. Also see [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/35712#commitcomment-18766233) and [this comment](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/35712#issuecomment-242453677) for more information, as there are several fields that need to be added to the `CLIENT_INTERNAL_KEYWORDS` frozen set in `salt/client/mixins.py`.
