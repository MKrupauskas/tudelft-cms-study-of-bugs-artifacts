After upgrading Salt-minion from 2015.5.3 => 2015.8.1 on an Ubuntu 14.04 box it resulted in a hanging salt-minion highstate.

We use the scheduler to run a highstate every 15 minutes, if the minion is restarted the counter is reset to 0 and executes a highstate. 
However, on all tested systems the process simply hangs. 

Either in a very early stage:

```
root@saas:~# salt-call state.highstate
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 25687 and was started at 2015, Oct 26 12:01:22.281533 with jid 20151026120122281533
root@saas:~# strace -p 25687
Process 25687 attached
restart_syscall(<... resuming interrupted call ...>^CProcess 25687 detached
 <detached ...>
```

or right after reading the minion key.

I killed the process after waiting for ~10 minutes without anything happening.
If I then run a new `salt-call state.highstate` it works just fine and keeps on working fine.
