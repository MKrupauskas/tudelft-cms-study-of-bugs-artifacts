On the latest develop code, I have a SLS with this:

``` YAML
hadoop-0.20-mapreduce-tasktracker:
  pkg:
    - installed
```

however, it fails because it couldn't find the package even though a `yum search hadoop-0.20-mapreduce-tasktracker` shows it exists if you have the appropriate Cloudera Hadoop repository enabled on your CentOS box.

Working with @gravyboat, we tracked this down to an issue we think is related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/a7d880cc456cd688b36b3078d27f87accfcc1993. 

The culprit is on line 215 of that commit where we're checking the parsed/split architecture to be in the list of "good" architectures. In this case, the parsed arch is `20-mapreduce-tasktracker`, so we return a pckgname of hadoop-0 which is invalid so the lookup fails. 

Changing the conditional to be "not in" fixes this issue for me...I'll be submitting a pull request shortly. Adding in @terminalmage to get his input in case we're missing something.
