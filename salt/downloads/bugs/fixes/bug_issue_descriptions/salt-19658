We have a custom grain module that grabs tags from GCE's metadata service and stuffs that into a grain (https://github.com/saltstack/salt-contrib/blob/master/grains/gce.py). When trying to use that grain in an orchestrate runner that we use, we aren't getting that grain set. This works fine everywhere else we use it.

Let me know if you need more info.
