### Description of Issue/Question

One of my states fails with the error `[ERROR] JSON Render failed for` when I try to apply it. The state seems to be applied in the background but the result output is broken. See below.

Looks similar to #37906, #16651

### Setup

I can reproduce this issue with the following state file located at `salt://php/wtf.sls`:

```yaml
# clone git repo for php build tools
make_php_repo:
  git.latest:
    - name: https://github.com/cebe/make-php.git
    - rev: 0f0817f4f1202d2e47ed771363fe4c6248217b11 # Jan 17, 2017
    - target: /tmp/test

# update gpg keyring
/tmp/test/make-php-keyring.sh:
  cmd.run:
    - require:
      - git: make_php_repo
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

applying it like this:

```
salt-ssh 'dvm2*' state.sls php.wtf
```

output:

```
