### Description of Issue/Question
Due to a change in the /etc/init.d/salt-minion service script in the RedHat-based RPMs, the old minion is not stopped properly and therefore the new minion does not come up cleanly.  This can be seen when upgrading from 2016.3.x or 2016.11.[0-2]. It would appear the RPM installs the new service scrjpt then tries to stop the process but by then the service script has changed the criteria it is looking for to identify the process to be stopped.

### Setup
Install salt-minion 2016.3.3 on a RedHat based architecture using the pre-v7 "service" methodology and start the service.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Check the pid and start time of the running minion
Use yum to install the 2016.11.3 minion
Observe the pid and start time
