I've got salt-master set up with a couple of minions (all Salt 0.15.1), and an instance of salt-api (0.8.1) running on the same server as the master. In the master configuration file, external_auth is set up as follows -

``` yaml
external_auth:
    pam:
        sam:
            - test.ping
```

Through curl to salt-api, logged in as the user 'sam', I can call 'test.ping' successfully, but not 'state.highstate', which gives me a 401 Unauthorized message. This is all as expected.

However, it seems that under the same conditions, I can call the wheel functions (e.g. key.list_all or key.accept) successfully.

``` sh
[sam@sandboxbravo ~]$ curl -i http://localhost:8000 -H 'Accept:
application/json' -d 'fun=key.accept' -d 'match=localhost.localdomain'
-d 'client=wheel' -H 'X-Auth-Token:
fdc5428447f748acf87e7c17d3038e5ffa6e5d1d'

{"return": [{"minions": ["localhost.localdomain"]}]}
```

This does not seem right; I should not be able to call any wheel functions unless explicitly permitted. This may also be possible through the Python client as well. It has been confirmed as an issue by Seth on the mailing list - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/4l213EIWeTM
