In following the example explicitly (i.e. copying/pasting example from http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.archive.html#module-salt.states.archive):
## saltminion7.example:

```
      ID: graylog2-server
Function: archive.extracted
    Name: /opt/
  Result: False
 Comment: tar archive need argument tar_options
 Changes:   
```

Also, if I add tar_options: xvf:

---

```
      ID: g2-server
Function: archive.extracted
    Name: /opt/
  Result: False
 Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1379, in call
              self.verify_ret(ret)
            File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 660, in verify_ret
              ).format(','.join(bad)))
          SaltException: The following keys were not present in the state return: name,result,changes,comment
 Changes:  
```

Typically, this error will go away if the 'if_missing' attribute is deleted (in which case, the salt run is successful, but no tar is extracted:
## saltminion7.example:

```
      ID: g2-server
Function: archive.extracted
    Name: /opt/
  Result: True
 Comment: /opt/ already exists
 Changes:   
```
