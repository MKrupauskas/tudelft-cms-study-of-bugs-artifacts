There is inconsistent use of `follow_symlinks` in `file.check_perms`

The owner of the file is first checked using `state` with `follow_symlinks=False`, and then with `get_user` which defaults to `follow_symlinks=True`.

This causes the state to fail for symlinks that have the correct ownership but point to files that have different ownership.

Looks to be caused by this change: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/7d4c470f91fcb43f505bfd220605fede1041437c#diff-7c48191b14cdf053cf954d03cc317963L2195
