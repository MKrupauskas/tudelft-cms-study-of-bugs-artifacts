### Description of Issue/Question
PR #48222 breaks this module, if you're running a version of GlusterFS not 4.0 and above.

### Setup
I upgraded from 2017.7.0 to 2018.3.3 (looks like this change was also backported to 2017.7 branch and later releases).

Run a version of GlusterFS not 4.0+.  Specifically, I'm running a 3.x version (test environment has 3.7.9).  The `gluster --version` command returns `glusterfs 3.7.9 built on Mar 20 2016 03:19:49` with that version and so with the change from `[1]` to `[-1]` in the line.split is what causes the issue, as the module now returns `03:19:49` and therefore cannot be processed correctly.

I have no idea how a 4.0+ return looks like, but the PR broke this module for older versions of GlusteFS.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
With a GlusterFS version of 3.x, run just about any of the module commands, as they're passed through _gluster_xml method that calls _get_version().  You should get a stack trace back similar to mine:

```
