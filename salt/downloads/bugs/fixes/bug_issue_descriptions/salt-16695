When using the openstack driver with rackspace, `--list-locations` does not provide the correct feedback:

```
salt-cloud --list-locations rackspace
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
rackspace:
    ----------
    openstack:
        ----------
        :
            ----------
            country:

            driver:
            id:
                0
            name:
```

I tried `--list-locations` with other provivders (ec2, digital ocean, and linode) and all worked as expected. This is broken on both `2014.7` and `develop`.
