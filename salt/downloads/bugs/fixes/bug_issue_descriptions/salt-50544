### Description of Issue/Question
When using external auth is not possible to delete the minion key.

It looks that key name is not passed to `_run_cmd` function in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/key.py#L179
```
_run_cmd: {'fun': 'key.delete', 'token': '7590720fd41faa2e98ddb3cd6947934bcf4c9fc5f74928a41ab08c375db22271', 'kwarg': {}, 'arg': [None]}
```
I was able to fix it by changing:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/key.py#L268
```
 ret = self._run_cmd(cmd)
```
Into:
```
                if self.opts.get('eauth') and cmd in ('accept', 'reject', 'delete'):
                    ret = self._run_cmd(cmd, args=ret['minions'])
                else:
                    ret = self._run_cmd(cmd)
```
It looks rather like workaround than a proper solution for me but it's working and I was unable to fix it in better way.

When `eauth` is not used then key name is fetched here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/key.py#L168

If You agree to such fix I could provide PR or provide better fix with some guidance how to do this in a proper way.

### Setup
Enable eauth in /etc/salt/master
```
external_auth:
  pam:
    users%:
      - '.*'
      - '@wheel'
      - '@runner'
      - '@jobs'
```
Add user to group `users`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Log on you user account and execute:
```
salt-key -T --auth=pam -d example_minion
```
