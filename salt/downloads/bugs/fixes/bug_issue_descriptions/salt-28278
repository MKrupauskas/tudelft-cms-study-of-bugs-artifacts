I'm having problem with `salt-ssh` using `publish.publish`, basically when I run:

``` bash
salt-ssh -i 'compute-*' publish.publish 'compute-*' grains.get fqdn_ip4
```

I got:

``` bash
compute-1:
    An Exception occurred while executing publish.publish: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/lib/salt-ssh-agent'
compute-2:
    An Exception occurred while executing publish.publish: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/lib/salt-ssh-agent
```

The directory above was the `thin_dir` that I set on my `roster` file:

``` yaml
compute-1:
  host: what.ever
  user: charlie
  sudo: True
  thin_dir: /var/lib/salt-ssh-agent

compute-2:
  host: what.ever
  user: charlie
  sudo: True
  thin_dir: /var/lib/salt-ssh-agent
```

I got `requiretty` turned off. And here's my `master` file that allows `grains.get` on every minion:

``` yaml

---
root_dir: .
file_roots:
  base:
    - srv/salt
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - srv/pillar
peer:
  .*:
    - grains.get
```

I use a `Saltfile` pointing the config directory to my current directory.

Am I doing it wrong? Does `salt-ssh` support the `publish` module?
