States are presented in one order and executed in another. 

Problem is with dict "matches" that is used to collect states that needs to be executed:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2016.11/salt/state.py
```
def top_matches(self, top):
        '''
        Search through the top high data for matches and return the states
        that this minion needs to execute.
        Returns:
        {'saltenv': ['state1', 'state2', ...]}
        '''
        matches = {}
```

When using env "base" and "dev" the ordering is by "accident" correct.

### Setup

master
```
state_output: mixed
file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/states/base
  test:
    - /srv/salt/states/test

fileserver_backend:
  - roots

pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/pillars/base
  test:
    - /srv/salt/pillars/test
  prod:
    - /srv/salt/pillars/prod
  vagrant:
    - /srv/salt/pillars/vagrant

log_level_logfile: debug
```
top.sls
```
base:
  '*':
    - info

test:
  'test*':
    - info2
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt 'test*' state.show_top
```
test.vagrant:
    ----------
    base:
        - info
    test:
        - info2
```
salt 'test*'state.apply

Actual output
```
test.vagrant:
  Name: /etc/salt-info2 - Function: file.managed - Result: Changed Started: - 20:24:24.554283 Duration: 76.348 ms
  Name: /etc/salt-info - Function: file.managed - Result: Changed Started: - 20:24:24.630809 Duration: 64.266 ms

Summary for test.vagrant
------------
Succeeded: 2 (changed=2)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     2
Total run time: 140.614 ms
```
Expected output
```
test.vagrant:
  Name: /etc/salt-info - Function: file.managed - Result: Changed Started: - 20:24:24.630809 Duration: 64.266 ms
  Name: /etc/salt-info2 - Function: file.managed - Result: Changed Started: - 20:24:24.554283 Duration: 76.348 ms

Summary for test.vagrant
------------
Succeeded: 2 (changed=2)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     2
Total run time: 140.614 ms
```
Info from base should be executed first and then Info2 from test.
