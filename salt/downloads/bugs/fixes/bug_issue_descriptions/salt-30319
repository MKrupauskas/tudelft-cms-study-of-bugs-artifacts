`state.apply` truncates the log when it's most probably too long, for instance it doesn't show the summary with successful/failed states, so it's not possible to figure out which states were failed. 

This doesn't happen when `state.highstate` is used or a single SLS is executed using `state.sls` subcommand, but the latter might be too short to trigger this bug.
