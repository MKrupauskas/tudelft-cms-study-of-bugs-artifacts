`clean_proc` makes the call to `os.kill` as follows:

``` python
            if proc.is_alive() and (waited >= wait_for_kill):
                log.error(
                    'Process did not die with terminate(): {0}'.format(
                        proc.pid
                    )
                )
                os.kill(signal.SIGKILL, proc.pid)
```

However, the docs have a different take on how it works. :)
