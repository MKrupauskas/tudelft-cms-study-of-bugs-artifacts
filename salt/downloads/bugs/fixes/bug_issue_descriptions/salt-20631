Hi,
It seems init_delay has no effect. 
consider following state file `random_tests/services_test.sls`

``` yaml
service-snmpd:
  service.running:
    - name: snmpd
    - enable: True
    - init_delay: 120
```

Below command was run:

``` bash
salt -E 'machine01' state.sls random_tests.services_test  saltenv=mydc  -t 5000 -v
```

And Following is the output:

``` yaml
Executing job with jid 20150212152951921367
-------------------------------------------

machine01:
----------
          ID: service-snmpd
    Function: service.running
        Name: snmpd
      Result: True
     Comment: Service snmpd is already enabled, and is running
     Started: 15:29:57.581759

              ----------
              snmpd:
                  True

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0

Total states run:     1
```

Please note "duration" in above output. It is less than 120 seconds. 
Even if snmpd took only 218ms to start, it should have waited for 120 seconds .
