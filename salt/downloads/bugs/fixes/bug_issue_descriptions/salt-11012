I am running salt as a non-root user and it had been working fine until I added new minion types to my config.

I have four minions configured as celery workers of two different types using pillar data. Each minion has a "role" of either celery-build or celery-test.

When I run:

```
salt -l debug "*" pillar.items role
```

I get the expected output, but when I run any command that tries to filter on that pillar field then Salt will return the data for the celery-build minions and then hang for minutes before giving me a permissions error and never returning the other minions. e.g.

```
salt -l debug -I "role:*" pillar.items role
```

this command displays the first two minions then fails after about four minutes. Sometimes pillar filtered commands do not give an error but do not give correct results either, the above command sometimes just returns only the two celery-build minions and none of the others.

Asking for all the minions with the role "celery-test" always gives me no results, yet asking for pillar.items on all minions clearly shows role: celery-test on two of them.
