### Description of Issue/Question

it seems that the salt-runner on the minion doesn't set the proper locale for the rabbitmq commands of erlang-20.1.7-1, rabbitmq-server-3.7.1

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

whenever i run a rabbitmq command on a minion from salt-master (e.g. `salt 'queue*' rabbitmq.status` I receive:

`ERROR: RabbitMQ command failed: warning: the VM is running with native name encoding of latin1 which may cause Elixir to malfunction as it expects utf8. Please ensure your locale is set to UTF-8 (which can be verified by running "locale" in your shell)
`

if i run the command on the minion directly (`salt-call rabbitmq.status`) everything is fine.

running `cmd.run locale` from salt-master:

```
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_CTYPE=C
    LC_NUMERIC=C
    LC_TIME=C
    LC_COLLATE=C
    LC_MONETARY=C
    LC_MESSAGES=C
    LC_PAPER=C
    LC_NAME=C
    LC_ADDRESS=C
    LC_TELEPHONE=C
    LC_MEASUREMENT=C
    LC_IDENTIFICATION=C
    LC_ALL=
```

running `salt-call cmd.run locale` on salt-minion:

```
local:
    LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```
