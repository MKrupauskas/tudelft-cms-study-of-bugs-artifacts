When using salt-cloud with Azure, if one forgets to install the required dependency Microsoft Azure for Python utils (pip install azure), they will receive the following misleading error

```
[WARNING ] The cloud driver, 'azure', configured under the 'providername' cloud provider alias was not loaded since 'azure.get_configured_provider()' could not be found. Removing it from the available providers list
```

This had me chasing all over the place for an azure.py file (which doesn't exist - as it is named msazure.py and aliased). Even when I found it, I was still confused as get_configured_provider() CAN be found in the source. I simply missed the dependency in the instructions. 

Would it be possible to put in a more meaningful error message when it doesn't find the azure dependency?
