https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.boto_secgroup.html

these docs need a minor update in that either vpc_id or vpc_name must be defined or the creation of a secgroup will end in error.

to recreate install salt 2015.8.2, create a simple boto_secgroup definition without defining a vpc_id or vpc_name and run the state.
