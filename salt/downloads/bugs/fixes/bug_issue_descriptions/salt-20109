Hello,

The postgresql user state/module is seeming unaware of the underlying postgresql version. On CentOS6, postgres8.4 is the default, and when creating users, it tries to apply the [NO]REPLICATION privilege, which does not seem to exist on this postgres version, I guess it's a 9-feature.

The module/state should check for the version, and apply the stuff respectively.
