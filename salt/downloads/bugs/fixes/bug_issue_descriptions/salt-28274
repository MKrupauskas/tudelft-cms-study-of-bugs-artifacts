I just upgraded my salt-master and one salt-minion to 2015.8.1 to troubleshoot https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/27414 with @rallytime, and noticed a new error when trying to run commands like `salt phx1-1 state.highstate`:

```
root@phx1-8:/srv/salt# salt phx1-1 state.highstate
phx1-1:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1161, in _thread_return
        data['arg'][ind],
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 498, in highstate
        conflict = _check_queue(queue, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 156, in _check_queue
        conflict = running()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 119, in running
        active = __salt__['saltutil.is_running']('state.*')
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/lazy.py", line 90, in __getitem__
        return self._dict[key]
    KeyError: 'saltutil.is_running'
root@phx1-8:/srv/salt#
```

Based on the minion logs, it does seem to actually execute the requested highstate, but never returns any output to the master that made the request.

If I execute the same commands locally on the minion using `salt-call`, I don't see this issue.

Is this a known issue?  Am I doing something wrong with my upgrade process?  (I followed https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/ubuntu.html).
