So, I am having trouble with the creation of hosts on Softlayer.  It creates the host but it looks like it is unable to contact the host and actually start the installation of the minion and times out after a 900 second counter tries to connect to the machine.

In Softlayer, I can look up the details for a host and ssh into the machine before the salt-cloud step times out and exits.

I am running the latest version of the salt master from git dev branch using salt bootstrap.

Thanks.
