### Description of Issue/Question

Code in the scheduler in Oxygen is using `mktime` which assumes localtime.  This can generate challenges for infrastructures where masters are in many timezones.  Allow scheduling to be specfiied in different timezones but store and process timestamps in UTC.  This enables client tools to display the time in whatever timezone.
