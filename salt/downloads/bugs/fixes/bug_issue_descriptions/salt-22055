This is related to similar issue described by 'mrtizmo' user in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/2220.

Whenever "sudo salt-key" is run, Salt-master resets the permissions of /etc/salt/pki to root:root.  This issue becomes apparent when someone is running salt-master as root user and when there is a requirement to keep different permissions of /etc/salt/pki (for example when you're rsyncing keys to other masters and you don't want to do it as root user).

Example:

```
$ sudo chown -R salt:salt /etc/salt/pki

$ sudo ls -l /etc/salt/pki
total 8
drwx------. 7 salt salt 4096 Jan 15 09:12 master
drwx------. 2 salt salt 4096 Jan 15 09:13 minion

$ sudo salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
server.fqdn
Rejected Keys:

$ sudo ls -l /etc/salt/pki
total 8
drwx------. 7 root root 4096 Jan 15 09:12 master
drwx------. 2 salt salt 4096 Jan 15 09:13 minion

$ sudo ls -l /etc/salt/pki/master
total 28
-r-------T. 1 salt salt 3239 Jan 15 09:12 master.pem
-rw-r--r-T. 1 salt salt  800 Jan 15 09:12 master.pub
drwxr-xr-t. 2 root root 4096 Mar 26 13:56 minions
drwxr-xr-t. 2 salt salt 4096 Jan 15 09:12 minions_autosign
drwxr-xr-t. 2 salt salt 4096 Jan 15 09:12 minions_denied
drwxr-xr-t. 2 root root 4096 Mar 26 13:56 minions_pre
drwxr-xr-t. 2 root root 4096 Jan 15 09:12 minions_rejected
```

This happens regardless if the minion keys are accepted or listed via "sudo salt-key".  Is there any way to preserve the permissions of the original user instead of resetting them to root:root?  This moment, whenever salt-master is run as root and any time "sudo salt-key" is run, you have to chown the directory permissions manually.
