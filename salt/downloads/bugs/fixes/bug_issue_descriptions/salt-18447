It looks like it's impossible to install salt currently without zmq, if you're using pip + git. I'd really be able to make a frozen virtualenv free of m2cypto and zmq from my git fork... How do I go about this? This is what happens when I hit the current 2014.7 branch in the upstream:

'pip install --install-option="--salt-transport=raet" -e git+https://github.com/saltstack/salt@2014.7#egg=salt

...

running develop

error: error in command line: command 'develop' has no such option 'salt_transport'

---

Cleaning up...'

Also, it looks like the egg always has zmq/m2crypto dependencies, even if raet is used.
