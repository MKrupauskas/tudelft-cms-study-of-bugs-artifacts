### Description of Issue/Question

Trying to follow the guide at to get events from a python scripts using the salt.utils.event class,
I noticed that when master is restarted the events do not keep coming any more.
[Saltstack Documentation ](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/event/index.html)

I noticed @DmitryKuzmenko did some changes for the minions and syndics in order to connect after disconnection. Maybe he could suggest something similar for the specific case ?

I also tried using iter_events with the same results.

Also get_event_block in a while loop throughs an exception but when I try to reconnect It fails.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Follow the steps at the documentation and restart master.
