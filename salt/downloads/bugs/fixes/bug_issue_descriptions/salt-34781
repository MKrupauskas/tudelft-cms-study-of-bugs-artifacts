see new comment below here https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/34781#issuecomment-233854043, this turned out to be another case where a jinjja2 template compilation simply failed silently with no info whatsoever being displayed.: 
### Description of Issue/Question

@twangboy help I just cannot get it to use some newly added winrepo-ng pkg files to install them. Pretty sure I am not doing anything wrong or different from previous versions.
### Setup

I create a new winrepo-ng file on the saltstack github site (as usual), then I git update my master and refresh_db my windows minions, but `pkg.install my-brand-new-pkg`, reports that said pkg cannot be located. Although I can see the file being copied to the cache during the refresh_db cmd. but a pgk.get_repo_data does indeed not show me the newly added pkg.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt my-win-minion pkg.refresh_db`
`salt my-win-minion pkg.install check_mk-agent-msi`
and it cannot locate the check_mk-agent-msi file. 
(Note: there is a number of check-mk-agent\* pkgs, `'check-mk'` not `'check_mk'` they are 'older' and I need to test some new ones under the name of 'check_mk-agent-msi')
### Versions Report

both master and minion are running on 2016.3.1
