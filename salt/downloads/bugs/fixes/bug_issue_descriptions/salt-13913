Running directly from the newest salt and raet in git, I am having salt * state.highstate exit back to the command line after checking the minions if they are running the commands only a small number of times (I think it is two)

This is causeing problems in salt-run state.over, because it is moving to the next step in the overstate before the initial highstate is run on the servers.

Thanks
Daniel
