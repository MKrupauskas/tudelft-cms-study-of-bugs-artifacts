I'm running `salt-ssh 2014.7.0rc2 (Helium)`

My target has a `/etc/salt/grains` file containing `foo: bar`.

When I run `sudo salt-call --local grains.get foo` on the target it returns `bar` as expected.

When I run `salt-ssh 'target' grains.get foo` I get nothing. Adding `--refresh` does not change anything.

This issue seems related https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8555
