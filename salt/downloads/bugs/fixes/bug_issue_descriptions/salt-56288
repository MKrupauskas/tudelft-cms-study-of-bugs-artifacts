### Description of Issue
<!-- Note: Please direct questions to the salt-users google group. Only post issues and feature requests here -->

Running the `lgpo.set` execution module with a secedit policy always generates an error: `KeyError: u'lgpo.secedit_data'`.

This happens because `set` calls [_write_secedit_data()](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/9adc2214c3bb7c68f820f7bd5fe5e132b7b3fbc9/salt/modules/win_lgpo.py#L5529) which attempts to pop `lgpo.secedit_data` off the `__context__`, but `set` never calls `_get_secedit_data()` which is where it is added to context.

### Setup
None really required. Just install salt. Tested both 2018.3.4 and 2019.2.3.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
C:\salt\salt-call.bat lgpo.set computer_policy="{'GuestAccountStatus': 'Enabled'}"
```
