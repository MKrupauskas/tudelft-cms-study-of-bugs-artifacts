### Description of Issue/Question
I would like to change the default location of the minion cache directory, so I have added `cachedir: /data/cache/salt/minion` to the minion config file. However, the extmods directory still keeps getting created in `/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods`.

This is likely because we have some grains and returners in the master file server under `salt://<env>/_grains` and `salt://<env>/_returners`. However, I am not able to find a way to change this behavior. This issue makes it sound like it should already be moved by changing `cachedir`: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/42943



### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Minion config file:
```
master: <redacted>

top_file_merging_strategy: same
default_top: base
saltenv: base

pillarenv_from_saltenv: True
startup_states: highstate
state_output: mixed

use_superseded:
  - module.run

cachedir: /data/cache/salt/minion
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Delete `/var/cache/salt/minion` on the minion then run highstate. Afterwards, `/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods` is created again with `grains` and `returners` inside. The rest of the minion cache is in `/data/cache/salt/minion` as expected.
