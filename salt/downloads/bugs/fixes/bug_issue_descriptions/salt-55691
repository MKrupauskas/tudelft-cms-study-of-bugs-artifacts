### Description of Issue

On Salt 2019.2.2 with Python 3, `salt-run net.find <ip address>` fails because of some out-of-date code.

```
[root@salt runners]# salt-run net.find 1.2.3.4
Details for all interfaces that include network 1.2.3.4/32 - only best match returned
ARP Entries for IP 1.2.3.4
Exception occurred in runner net.find: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 377, in low
    data['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/runners/net.py", line 894, in find
    device, interface, mac = _find_interfaces_mac(ip)
  File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/runners/net.py", line 228, in _find_interfaces_mac
    ip_addresses.extend(interface_ipaddrs.get('ipv6', {}).keys())
AttributeError: 'dict_keys' object has no attribute 'extend'
```
and
```
[root@salt runners]# salt-run net.find 1.2.3.4

Passed invalid arguments: '>' not supported between instances of 'IPNetwork' and 'NoneType'
```


### Setup
On proxy minions:

```
mine_functions:
  net.ipaddrs: []
  net.lldp: []
  net.mac: []
  net.arp: []
  net.interfaces: []
```
