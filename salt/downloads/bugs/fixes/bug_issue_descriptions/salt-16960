`salt.modules.zpool.create` fails with the message `Unable to create storage pool mypool`. Upon further debugging, i saw the following error message in the log:

```
invalid vdev specification
use '-f' to override the following errors:
/dev/vdf does not contain an EFI label but it may contain partition
information in the MBR.
```

This message should be shown in the return output so it's easier for the user to determine why it failed. Also, `force=true|false` should be added so that the error could be overridden.
