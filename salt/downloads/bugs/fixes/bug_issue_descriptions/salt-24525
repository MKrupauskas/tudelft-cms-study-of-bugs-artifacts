I've got the 2015.5 salt PPA installed on an ubuntu precise minion, and apt-get upgrading gives me this:

```
root@ns2:/home/mrten# apt-get dist-upgrade
Reading package lists... Done

Calculating upgrade... Done
The following packages have been kept back:
  salt-common salt-minion
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
```

With aptitude I can see that I miss a dependency on `python-requests (>=1.0.0)` but that package isn't available for precise, not in precise-updates nor in precise-backports.

```
root@ns2:/etc/apt# apt-cache policy python-requests
python-requests:
  Installed: 0.8.2-1
  Candidate: 0.8.2-1
  Version table:
 *** 0.8.2-1 0
        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise/universe amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
```

This is my `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt-ppa.list`:

```
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/saltstack/salt2015-5/ubuntu precise main
```

But I can't find a python-requests there either.
