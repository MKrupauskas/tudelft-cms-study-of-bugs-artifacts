`mod_watch` in [states/supervisord.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/supervisord.py#L194) doesn't include the `update` argument, and the arguments are passed by position, causing incorrect values.

In my case, it's not passing update=True, so the supervisor daemon isn't reloading with updated config settings.
