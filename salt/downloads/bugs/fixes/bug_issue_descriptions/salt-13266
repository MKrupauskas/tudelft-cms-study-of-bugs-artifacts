I am attempting to destroy a map of VM's using the devel vSphere cloud provider. The VM's get created just fine and I can destroy them one-by-one, but I can't seem to destroy them using "salt-cloud /etc/salt/cloud.maps.d/testpool.map -d" as it throws this exception.

Output:
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
