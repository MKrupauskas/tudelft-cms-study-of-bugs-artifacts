## Description of Issue
When trying to run the nftables.get_rules command, the state always fails with a syntax error:

```
Command '[u'nft', u'--numeric', u'--numeric', u'--numeric', u'list', u'table', u'ip', u'ip']' failed with return code: 1

Error: syntax error, unexpected ip, expecting string
list table ip ip
              ^^
Error: syntax error, unexpected ip6, expecting string
list table ip6 ip6
               ^^^
```

This also appears to break the nftables.save function and therefore affects the nftables.managed state when one tries to make their nftable rules persistent with the `save=True` parameter.

I looked at the code of the nftables module and it appears to be a problem in passing the wrong list element from the previously splitted table.
The code that does this is `table_name = table.split(' ')[1]`
The value of table output it tries to parse is something like `table ip input {`, with the chain element  the third element but instead it takes the second one, that is the tables family.
After quickly fixing this to `table_name = table.split(' ')[2]` the state now returns rule lists. I just don't know if this fix of mine now breaks the module for non RHEL distributions but we could reproduce this behaviour on CentOS7 and CentOS8 machines.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```salt test12 nftables.get_rules```
