### Description of Issue/Question

I just upgraded my salt master from Ubuntu 14.04(trusty) to Ubuntu 16.04(xenial). I am using the salt-api to retrieve salt keys for AWS instances. This worked with trusty, but is failing with xenial. I found mention of the documentation that 3.2.3 is the ideal version of python-cherrypy. The version in trusty is 3.2.2, and xenial is 3.5.0. I made my own version of python-cherrypy3 package, 6.0.1.

The error comes from the client. The salt-api doesn't log anything even in debug. It seems like the connection times out.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Start salt_api
Run openssl s_client -connect salt-master:8000

Error:
139707275663224:error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number:s3_pkt.c:362:
### Versions Report

Works:
