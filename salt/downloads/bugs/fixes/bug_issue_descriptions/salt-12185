Running salt-minion on Debian on a [cubieboard v2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubieboard) board, when running `saltutil.kill_job` function I get the following exception (this has also appeared once on a `state.highstate` run):

```

I suppose this is because salt-minion is running on an armhf Debian system?
Is salt/msgpack supposed to work on armhf architectures?

Please tell me how can I help provide more information to investigate this issue.

For information, here are the versions reports for salt-minion:

```
