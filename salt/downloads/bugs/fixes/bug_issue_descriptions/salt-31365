It looks like the osrelease\* grains aren't being set on CentOS 7 with 2015.8.5 as they were with 2015.5.x.  The osrelease_info bits mostly fell out.

2015.5.x:

```

    CentOS

    RedHat
osarch:
    x86_64

osmajorrelease:
    7
osrelease:
    7.1.1503
osrelease_info:
    - 7
    - 1
    - 1503
```

2015.8.5:

```
