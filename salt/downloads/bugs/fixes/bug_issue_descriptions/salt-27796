Hi,

I am using salt.wheel python module to manage minion keys. But when it throws the error below when trying to delete a minion key. However, running salt-key -d <minion_id> works fine.
Am using an unprivileged user to run salt-master and i also changed the ownership of the following dirs : 
/var/cache/salt
/var/log/salt
 /etc/salt/pki

salt version : 

```
