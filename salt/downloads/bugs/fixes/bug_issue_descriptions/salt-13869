If I run salt-ssh 'myserver' pkg.upgrade on my Ubuntu server, it responds with nothing even though there has been an error at the minion.

Real world case:

```
# root@mymachine /home/laite
> salt-ssh 'myserver' pkg.upgrade
myserver:
    ----------
# root@mymachine /home/laite
> salt-ssh 'myserver' cmd.run 'apt-get dist-upgrade'
myserver:
    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
    E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
```

Here's the answer I got at #salt: 

> unfortunately _get_upgradable() doesn't to any checking of the exit code and simply parses the output for upgradable packages. It might be a good idea to make this a bit more robust and actually fail if the apt-get --just-print dist-upgrade run fails
