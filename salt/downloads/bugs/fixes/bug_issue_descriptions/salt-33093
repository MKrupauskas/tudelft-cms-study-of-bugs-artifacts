### Description of Issue/Question

There is a race condition when assigning floating_ips to cloud servers with the nova driver.  If the server is not in an ACTIVE state when the nova tries to associate the ip, we may get the following error

```
The following exception was thrown by libcloud when trying to assing a floating ip: No nw_info cache associated with instance (HTTP 400) (Request-ID: req-039b6371-8f58-4800-8333-d833b784b2b0)
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Boot a server with a floating ip, and have the driver attempt to assign the ip before the server is active.
