When sending data via http.query to a RESTful server, data sent from the network module is not JSON compliant.

Here is the state file:
network.sls

```
{% set newSubnet = salt['network.subnets']()[0] %}
{% set newIP = salt['network.ipaddrs']()[0] %}
{% set newGateway = salt['ip.get_default_gateway']() %}

update_network:
  event:
    - send
    - name: trigger/network/update
    - data:
        fqdn: {{ grains['fqdn'] }}
        id: {{ grains['id'] }}
        network_subnet: {{ newSubnet }}
        network_ip: {{ newIP }}
        network_gateway: {{ newGateway }}
```
I then have a reactor that sends that to our server, but the data is invalid. I had the data go through Fiddler on my laptop and found the issue is that the value has double double quotes, ie ""value"" instead of "value"
Here is the actual data sent:
```
{ "network_subnet": ""192.168.10.0/24"", "network_gateway": ""192.168.10.1"", "network_ip": ""192.168.10.140""}
```
I use the same state file (except pulling grains data) and it works - values are in single double quotes.
