For context see: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/vvG-XFj0ST0

When using the documentation found here: http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/cloud_controller.html to push out libvirt keys to each minion a silent failure happens. The keys are never pushed out to the minions nor are they on the salt master any place. This causes the libvirt keys to not function as it should.
