### Description of Issue/Question

The command ```sudo salt "host.*" state.highstate terse=true```
causes the following error when the appropriate option is already present in the .ini file:

```
    Function: ini.options_present
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1837, in call

### Setup

```
  ini.options_present:
    - sections:                                                                                                        
        server:                                                                                                        
          root_url: 'https://someurl'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Create init.sls with options_present, a section and a key as shown above (Setup).

2. Make sure that the .ini file going to be updated already contains the appropriate values.

3. Execute ```sudo salt "host.*" state.highstate terse=true```

4. The command throws an error until the ```root_url``` is deleted manually from the .ini file.
