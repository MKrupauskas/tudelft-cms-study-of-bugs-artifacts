When switching git.latest to a revision not already present locally, I get

```

To make it work, I had to manually perform a `git fetch` and re-run salt.
### Setup

```
    git.latest:
        - name: https://github.com/elifesciences/lax
        - rev: {{ salt['elife.cfg']('project.revision', 'project.branch', 'master') }}
        - branch: pinned-revision
        - target: /srv/lax/
        - force_fetch: True
        - force_checkout: True
        - force_reset: True
```

We had to specify a `branch` here or `revision` was getting ignored, leaving the repository on the previously existing branch.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The `git.latest` configuration is provided, and the repository is public. I guess this isn't repository-specific but happens with this configuration when you're requiring a new sha that is present on the remote but not locally.
