### Description of Issue/Question
When running a salt-ssh command and a user attempts to abort the job with Ctrl + C three exit messages are printed as shown below:

```
(salt-py3)   salt git:(c4eba60307) sudo salt-ssh 'manual*' test.sleep 20
^C
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c

Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c

Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
(salt-py3)   salt git:(c4eba60307) 
```

To note i am targeting two minions.

on 2018.3.3 it only prints one "Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c"

### Setup
Add two minions to your roster file
