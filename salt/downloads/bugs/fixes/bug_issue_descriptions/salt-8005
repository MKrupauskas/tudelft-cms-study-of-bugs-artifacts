I want to run state.highstate from my local OSX workstation to an clean install Ubuntu server.
I also want to keep the states and pillars, that by default are in /srv/salt and /srv/pillar, in a local folder for easy version control.

So I was hoping that this would do the trick, but nothing changes:

``` sh
$ salt-ssh -c ./ 'apps-*' state.highstate 
apps-production:
    ----------
```

It seems like no states or pillars are found. Trying to show the top state returns successfully, but empty:

``` sh
$ salt-ssh -c ./ 'apps-*' state.show_top
apps-production:
    {}
```

If i list pillar.items I see the default master configuration, and not the one in my local directory.

Any ideas what I can do to troubleshoot this? I've run this on todays develop branch. There is a thread on the issue as well, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/d7aryv1Jc9c
