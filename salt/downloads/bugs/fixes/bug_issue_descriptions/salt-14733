Our Salt enviroment consists of "production" (base) and "development" (dev). 
In base there is an include of a base environment setup (on `*`) which installs some stuff including Zabbix Agent (via the "official" Saltstack Formula). This works fine, however... we're faced with duplicate SLS ID's when highstating a machine in the dev environment:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'monitoring.zabbix.server' in env 'dev'
----------
    No matching sls found for 'monitoring.zabbix.server' in env 'dev'
----------
    No matching sls found for 'monitoring.zabbix.server' in env 'dev'
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
    The conflicting ID is "zabbix_repo" and is found in SLS "base:zabbix.repo" and SLS "dev:zabbix.repo"
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
    The conflicting ID is "zabbix_repo_add_gpg" and is found in SLS "base:zabbix.repo" and SLS "dev:zabbix.repo"
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
    The conflicting ID is "/var/tmp/zabbix-official-repo.gpg" and is found in SLS "base:zabbix.repo" and SLS "dev:zabbix.repo"
```

The particular zabbix_repo sls is one that extends. It is only being included once (in base) but things get messed up in "lower" enviroments.

The fileserver is configured to inherit: Dev inherits everything from the higher environments, Test inherits Prod (and has its own env) and then there's Prod which inherits nothing:

```
file_roots:
    base:
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/states
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/templates
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/files
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/formulas
    qa:
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/states    
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/states
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/templates  
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/templates
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/files  
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/files
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/formulas
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/formulas
    dev:
        - /srv/salt/environments/dev/states
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/states
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/states
        - /srv/salt/environments/dev/templates
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/templates
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/templates
        - /srv/salt/environments/dev/files
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/files
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/files        
        - /srv/salt/environments/dev/formulas
        - /srv/salt/environments/qa/formulas
        - /srv/salt/environments/prod/formulas
```

Shortened version of `states/top.sls`:

```
base:
  '*':
    - example.base
  'shared01.example.com':
    - zendserver
    - mariadb
    - postfix
    - nodes.shared01
dev:
  'shared01.dev.example.net':
    - zendserver
    - mariadb
    - postfix
    - nodes.shared01
  'monitoring01.dev.example.net':
    - monitoring.zabbix.server
```

The `monitoring.zabbix.server` contains:

```
# Zabbix server config
include:
  - postfix
  - mariadb
  - php5.fpm.conf
  - php5.mysql
  - zabbix.users
  - zabbix.mysql.conf
  - zabbix.mysql.schema
  - zabbix.server.conf
  - zabbix.frontend.conf

```

Issue with some more background info:
https://github.com/moreda/zabbix-saltstack-formula/issues/2

It appears that inheritance in combination with `extend` is causing issues. If any more information is needed, please let me know.
