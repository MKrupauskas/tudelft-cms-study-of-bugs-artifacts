### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use a DNS server where you can configure reverse dns. Set the reverse DNS for your minion's IP to something other than the minions hostname.

`salt-call grains.get host` and `salt-call grains.get fqdn` will return the reverse dns address rather than the minions locally configured hostname and fqdn.
