Hello:

first of all thanks for the great product.  

Here is out setup.  salt-master (lets say master.berkeley.com) is configured to run as root user.  one of the minions running on a different host (minion.berkeley.com) is configured to run as non-root user (unix account: vivek).  when we initiate commands to the minion from master - example (salt 'minion.berkeley.com' cmd.run 'ulimit -n') the output is different than what we get on running the same as "vivek" user on the minion.berkeley.com

output from when executed from the salt-master:
salt 'master.berkeley.com' cmd.run 'ulimit -n'
master.berkeley.com:
          1024

on the minion host as user vivek:
ulimit -n
65536

I believe what was happening is when we invoke from the salt-master, it's running su vivek -c 'ulimit -n' and returning the output to the master, where as it should run su - vivek -c 'ulimit -n' (note the - before vivek)

Is this an expected behavior with salt or a known issue that is planned to be fixed in the future releases?  Please let me know if you need any additional information about the issue.
