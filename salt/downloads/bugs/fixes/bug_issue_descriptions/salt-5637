From salt-users:

> We have minion running on Windows Server 2008 & configured to run as service. Its connected with the Master on a Redhat, it works perfect when the user logged into the server is still connected. Once we logout the user, the connection between the minion & master is lost even though the minion is still running as service.

> Also tried starting minion in debug mode but not able to figure out how to set the master configuration. As per the default installation configuration it works fine, if i start in debug mode with C:\salt\conf its not working. Still it takes the default "salt" as master.

This smells familiar.... I think the problem it is then time.sleep() raises an IOError when a user logs off (Interrupted System Call IIRC). It's pure evil! I presume it interrupts any system call - zmq socket calls etc...
