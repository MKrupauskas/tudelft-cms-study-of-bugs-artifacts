Hello,

I would like to be able to do more complex things with the salt mine in order to do some DNS tricks. Salt-contrib has a great tool to extract metadata information from an AWS instance https://github.com/saltstack/salt-contrib/blob/master/grains/ec2_info.py
# Background

In my pillar I have the following"

```
mine_functions:
  network.ip_addrs: [eth0]
  grains.get: ['ec2']
```

and in my state file

```
{% for server, data in salt['mine.get']('roles:master', 'grains.get', expr_form='grain').items() %}
{{ data }}
{% endfor %}
```

This produces a great chunk of json will all kinds of exciting stuff: https://gist.github.com/mooperd/61c17881306630068dd0

Im able to grab specific fields using the following.

```
{% for server, data in salt['mine.get']('roles:master', 'grains.get', expr_form='grain').items() %}
{{ data['block_device_mapping'] }}
{% endfor %}
```

output: {'ami': '/dev/sda1', 'root': '/dev/sda1'}

```
{% for server, data in salt['mine.get']('roles:master', 'grains.get', expr_form='grain').items() %}
{{ data['block_device_mapping']['ami'] }}
{% endfor %}
```

output:  /dev/sda1
# Actual Problem

I would like to be able to grab several specific grain items in order to generate a CNAME record. I can get the AWS public hostname from ['ec2']['public_hostname'] but I cannot work out how to get other grains.

```
mine_functions:
  network.ip_addrs: [eth0]
  grains.get: ['ec2']
  grains.get: ['localhost']
```

Using this I get the error: Pillar render error: Rendering SLS 'ip' failed.
I guess it is not liking the two "grains.get". 

The question is: How do I grab ALL grains or MULTIPLE grains into the mine?

Cheers,

Andrew
