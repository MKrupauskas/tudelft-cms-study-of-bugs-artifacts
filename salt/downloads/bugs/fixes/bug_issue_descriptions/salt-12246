I investigated reason of very slow SaltStack works.
As result I changed
time salt '*' state.highstate from 4 minutes (!!!) to 8 seconds.

Reason was very unoptimal work with DNS.
I made error in config for dnscache, as result all request to my internal development zone walk over dnscache => root DNS server => registrator => my gateway with DNS proxy => tinydns

After fix query walk over dnscache => tinydns (local networks).

What interesting: option "dns_cache: False" in salt minion and master does NOT help.
Salt everycase lookup FQDN over DNS.

I propose to investigate reason of very slow SaltStack work.
So, reproduction is simple: just hack your DNS to works slowly and see dramatically performance degradation.
