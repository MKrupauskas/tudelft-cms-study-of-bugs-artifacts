salt-ssh looks for /etc/salt/roster which is not present using the homebrew package. 
I can specify it via command line, but that's quite annoying.

Is it possible to read from  a ~/.salt/roster type config? If not, would anyone be interested in seeing it added? I think this will give some flexibility of running salt in different environments.
