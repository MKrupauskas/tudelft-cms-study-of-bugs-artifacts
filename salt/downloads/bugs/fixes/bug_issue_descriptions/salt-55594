### Description of Issue
We receive this error when attempting to apply salt states to a given minion.

```
# salt 'myminion1' state.apply
...
 myminion1:
 Data failed to compile:
 ----------
 Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
 ----------
 Failed to load ext_pillar s3: [Errno 17] File exists: '/var/cache/salt/master/pillar_s3fs/base/mybucket/pillar/myminion2'
...
```

### Setup

Configure salt master to use S3 as a pillar source:
```
ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - __env__ ssh://git@mygitserver.com/pillar.git:
      - pubkey: '/etc/salt/ssh/saltmaster-id_rsa.pub'
      - privkey: '/etc/salt/ssh/saltmaster-id_rsa'
  - s3:
      bucket: mys3bucket
      prefix: pillar
```

Write your pillar data to S3. We have a unique pillar setup for each minion in the format of `minionid/init.sls`. We currently have 2249 pillar folder/file combinations in the bucket.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Doesn't seem to be consistently reproducible. Manually clearing the file it complains about typically allows us to run commands again. My guess is maybe there's a cleanup process for the cache that isn't fully clearing all files.

I've seen older issues related to the Pillar S3 provider not syncing more than 1000 files, but that seems to have been closed in 2015, so I don't think that's the problem.
