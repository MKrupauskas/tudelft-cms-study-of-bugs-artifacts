So this is probably me doing something wrong, however in a folder 'foo', I have bar.sls and init.sls.

init.sls contains

```
include:
  - .bar
```

I'd expect that to be /srv/salt/foo/bar.sls, however it seems to be looking at /srv/salt/bar.sls , therefore making me have to put - .foo.bar which in my mind is wrong.

Thoughts?
