**Description**
Windows Server 2016 Server by default BITS Service is in stopped state and is set to Manual start. When Salt win_wua module is used **Example:** command "**salt minion win_wua.list**" is used to check and Install updates for Windows Server 2016 Minions, it fails with "**ERROR: Unknown Failure: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (0, None, None, None, 0, -2145107945), None)**". 

If I start BITS service manually on the minions(Windows Server 2016) salt command works fine to check, sync and install patches on Windows Server 2016. However it must be run before BITS service stops (from master). Which is by default BITS service stops if there is no BITS jobs(in 2 min) on Windows Server 2016. 

**Setup**


**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
From Master "salt minion win_wua.list" fails with "ERROR: Unknown Failure: (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (0, None, None, None, 0, -2145107945), None)". Because Windows BITS Service is stopped by default in Windows Server 2016 and salt is unable to generate BITS job which triggers BITS Service to start. This is very specific to Windows Server 2016. If we Start BITS Service and run"salt minion win_wua.list" immediately after with in 2 minutes, it works fine. 

However interestingly, if i run this on local machine "salt-call win_wua.list" it works fine without any issues. "salt-call win_wua.list" seem to be generating/triggering BITS Job and which is automatically starting BITS service.

**Expected behaviour**
Running "**salt minion win_wua.list**" from master should work similar to "**salt-call win_wua.list**" {running from local machine}
