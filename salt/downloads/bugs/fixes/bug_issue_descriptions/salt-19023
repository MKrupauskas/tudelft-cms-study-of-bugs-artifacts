Hi guys,

I have a task to setup scheduling on Windows machine by provisioning with Saltstack. I found that there is scheduling in salt, my test State is:

``` yml
job3:
  schedule.present:
    - function: test.ping
    - seconds: 3600
    - splay: 10
```

unfortunately even this simple code fails on the Windows box I test it:

```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to import returner :
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt/loader.py", line 621, in gen_module
ImportError: No module named
local:
----------
          ID: job3
    Function: schedule.present
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call l

                File "salt/states/schedule.py", line 129, in present
              TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable
     Started: 15:24:37.925000
    Duration: 16.0 ms
     Changes:

Total states run:     1
```

Any suggestions what I can use to add scheduled jobs into Window scheduler? I tried also **at** package, but didn't work out as well
