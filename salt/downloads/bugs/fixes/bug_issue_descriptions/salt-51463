### We are running highstate on a group of 7000 servers using grains in a batch of 30 with timout of 240. The job runs on part of the servers and exists with error as mentioned in subject line.

### Setup
All the highstates are pushed from master syndic using cron to the minions.
command:
salt -C 'G@os_family:RedHat and ( G@adbe:network_info:*:region:<region> or I@adbe:hostinfo_itcloud:cloud_location:<region>)' state.highstate --batch-size 30 -t 240

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I am just running highstate using grains based on OS and region which targets around 4000 servers with batch size 25 and timeout 300. I dont think you can reproduce the error unless you have that big enviroment.
