When starting the master this message gets logged:

```
2016-01-20 17:43:12,787 [salt.utils.parsers][WARNING ][33485] Master received a SIGTERM. Exiting.
2016-01-20 17:43:34,825 [salt.loader      ][ERROR   ][34694] Failed to import runners asam, this is due most likely to a syntax error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt/loader.py", line 1228, in _load_module
  File "salt/runners/asam.py", line 71, in <module>
NameError: name 'HTMLParser' is not defined
```

The `__virtual__` function does seem to handle the cases when HTMLParser is not importable...

But because this class is also defined:

``` python
class ASAMHTMLParser(HTMLParser):
  ...
```

In the main namespace, python fails to load the module due to missing HTMLParser and salt never get's to the `__virtual__` call due to the python complaining.

I tried changing some of the order but had no success.
