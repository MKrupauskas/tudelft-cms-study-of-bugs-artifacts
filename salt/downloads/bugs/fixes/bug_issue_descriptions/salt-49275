### Description of Issue/Question
cp.cache_file fails on CentOS 7 python2 installation with Tornado 4.2.1 with the error "Passed invalid arguments to cp.cache_file: invalid arguments to setopt" when running the execution module from the shell. Anything which obviously is using cp.cache_file to download something is failing.

cp.cache_file works on CentOS 7 python34 installation with Tornado 4.4.2

### Setup
CentOS 7 with salt python2 from repo https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/salt-repo-latest-2.el7.noarch.rpm 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
$ salt "<CentOS 7 minion with python2>" cp.cache_file <any external url>
Passed invalid arguments to cp.cache_file: invalid arguments to setopt
...
<output of documention for cp.cache_file>
...
```
