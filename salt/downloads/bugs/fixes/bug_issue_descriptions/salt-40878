### Description of Issue/Question

After installing Salt 2016.11.4, my states spews

```
[WARNING ] Public Key hashing currently defaults to "md5". This will change to "sha256" in the Nitrogen release.
```

several dozen times when applied. This appears to be the result of #40543, which adds the `fingerprint_hash_type` option and warns if it's not set. I appreciate the effort to both move off of MD5 and help users migrate. However, some callers of `_fingerprint`  *in the same file* still call directly without a hash, and there's no way for the user to provide one.

The simplest fix may be to have these callers provide literally any hash function, since most seem to be using it to validate keys rather than actually look at the fingerprint. Above that, I'm not sure why `_fingerprint`, a private function, is taking the hash as an *optional* argument in the first place. It seems like this would have been caught earlier had the argument been mandatory and caused an error rather than an ignorable warning, thereby forcing callers passing user data to pass None if they wanted the warning.
