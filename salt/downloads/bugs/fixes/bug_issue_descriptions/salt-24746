Something seems to be going wrong when using `state.apply` instead of `state.highstate` or `state.sls`. I'm using `salt-ssh` (not sure if that matters). I'm running the latest commit on the `2015.5` branch.

```
$ salt-ssh --version
salt-ssh 2015.5.2-88-gc8713f2 (Lithium)
```

```
$ salt-ssh vagrant-dev state.highstate
vagrant-dev:

```
$ salt-ssh vagrant-dev state.sls php
vagrant-dev:

$ salt-ssh vagrant-dev state.apply php
vagrant-dev:

```

I'm really confused as to why this would happen, as the [`state.apply` function](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/4cbef0f7e4f18eeca747987cf05a86d49153d166/salt/modules/state.py#L296-L298) is just a 3 line if/else statement.
