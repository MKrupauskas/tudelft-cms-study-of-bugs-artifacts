I'm getting an exception In salt-cloud/clouds/digital_ocean.py, line 403, with no real indication of what the problem is:

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/saltcloud/clouds/digital_ocean.py", line 403, in query
    result.get('error_message', {}).items()
AttributeError: 'unicode' object has no attribute 'items'
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: 'bool' object has no attribute 'pop'

It turns out that result.error_message is a string, not a dict.

Right now is a good time to reproduce this -- by changing that section to raise an error with result.get('error_message',''), I got the actual error being returned by Digital Ocean: "Size is not available in this region."

To reproduce, configure a Digital Ocean provider/profile, and attempt to create any vm 1GB or bigger in location "San Francisco 1". That is, until they provision more hardware!
