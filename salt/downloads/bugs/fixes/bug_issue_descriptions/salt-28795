When trying to run beacons.modify or beacons.add for a custom beacon, I get a Beacon does not exist error:

```
root@5a4791a27ff5:/# salt 'minion1' beacons.modify my_beacon "{'interval': '30'}"
minion1:
    ----------
    comment:
        Beacon my_beacon does not exist
    result:
        True
```

After digging into the code, it looks like these functions in [beacons.py](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/d3643fc08b6f404e633193e4c953eb3a12a7652c/salt/modules/beacons.py) try to import the beacon from salt.beacons.<beacon name>. The custom beacon is not located in this module.

Is there something we need to do so that these functions work for custom beacons?

Other functions like enabling or disabling the individual beacons work.

Here's the output of my `salt --versions-report`:
