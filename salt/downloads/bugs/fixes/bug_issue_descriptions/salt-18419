Post e85e2c2 (Add Salt Cloud roster) I am having the following issue with running salt-cloud as a non-root user.

```
# on develop (2db74b1)
$ salt-cloud -m cloud.maps.d/dev.conf
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[INFO    ] Applying map from 'cloud.maps.d/dev.conf'.
The following virtual machines are set to be created:
  alex

Proceed? [N/y] y
... proceeding
[INFO    ] Calculating dependencies for alex
[ERROR   ] There was a query error: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache'
```

I'm not sure why it's trying to write to `/var`, as my config should be overriding the root directory to the current directory.

If I checkout a commit before e85e2c2 I can run the above just fine. When I go back to develop, the destroy is successful despite the error message.

```
# ... ran successfully on older commit.

# and now back on develop (2db74b1)
$ salt-cloud -m cloud.maps.d/dev.conf -d
[INFO    ] salt-cloud starting
[INFO    ] Applying map from 'cloud.maps.d/dev.conf'.
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:

Proceed? [N/y] y

[ERROR   ] There was an error destroying machines: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache'
```

I'm suspicious of how `salt.syspaths` doesn't seem to be aware of the config in `Saltfile` and `cloud` config files, but that's all I've got at the moment.
