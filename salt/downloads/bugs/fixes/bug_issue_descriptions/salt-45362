### Description of Issue/Question
The `seed` module has a ` _check_resolv`-function which checks for a valid resolv.conf file in the guest image and replaces the file if the file if not valid. As mentioned in #45344 the implementation could be improved by temporarily replacing the guest's resolv.conf with the minion's instead of simply overwriting the file. 
The current implementation breaks images which are not served a DNS server via. DHCP or network managers like ifupdown or similar upon boot.
