### Description of Issue/Question

Running salt-cloud with a subnetname in the profile will fail if not all subnets have tags.
In salt/cloud/clouds/ec2.py the function def: def _get_subnetname_id(subnetname), a KeyError will be raised on this check:

if tag['key'] == 'Name' and tag['value'] == subnetname:

This is because tag might not be a list or dict, and might not have anything in there at all. This happens because aws.query a few lines up returns a collection of subnets, but not every subnet has tags, i.e. default subnets in a default VPC have no tags at all. This causes tagSet to be non-existent, which in turn causes the tags variable to be nothing.

Adding a quick check to make sure tagSet actually exists before continuing fixes this for me. The def then looks like this:

````
    '''
    Returns the SubnetId of a SubnetName to use
    '''
    params = {'Action': 'DescribeSubnets'}
    for subnet in aws.query(params, location=get_location(),
               provider=get_provider(), opts=__opts__, sigver='4'):
        tags = subnet.get('tagSet', {}).get('item', {})
        if(subnet.has_key("tagSet")):
            if not isinstance(tags, list):
                tags = [tags]
            for tag in tags:
                if tag['key'] == 'Name' and tag['value'] == subnetname:
                    log.debug('AWS Subnet ID of {0} is {1}'.format(
                        subnetname,
                        subnet['subnetId'])
                    )
                    return subnet['subnetId']
    return None
````
The added line was if(subnet.has_key("tagSet")): and I indented everything below it to skip that specific loop run.

I'm not 100% sure what this is supposed to help with:
````
            if not isinstance(tags, list):
                tags = [tags]
````
perhaps it was an earlier attempt at detecting the existence, but instead of breaking the loop it created a list of whatever tags was.
