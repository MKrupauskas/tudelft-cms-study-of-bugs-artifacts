I'm having the same issue that was reported in #7576 , but with salt-call. I.e., if I use salt-call to run a state with file.managed, and it manages a file with UTF-8 characters (either the source or the destination file), the exception "UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte ..." appears. The same state, when run from the saltmaster, works flawlessly.

I'm running Saltstack 2014.1.13, in Ubuntu 14.04.

Thanks in advance.
