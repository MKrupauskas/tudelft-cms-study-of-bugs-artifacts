On debian wheezy, and perhaps others this method results in malformed mdadm.conf.

The first bug is that the individual conf lines are joined with " " even though the config format expects each array item to be on a separate line.

Additionally it looks like the lines are always appended to the end of the file regardless of whether there are existing config lines which reference the same raid volumes. 

See the below snippet from a debian wheezy box which had 2 pre-exsting raid volumes and then had a 3rd added by salt before calling salt.modules.mdadm.save_config

```
# definitions of existing MD arrays
ARRAY /dev/md/0 metadata=1.2 UUID=1b63f429:b5311c0e:0b5eb8ae:43057b09 name=salt1:0
ARRAY /dev/md/1 metadata=1.2 UUID=9f205e2f:3f19246e:556e2f8d:ffec00bd name=salt1:1
