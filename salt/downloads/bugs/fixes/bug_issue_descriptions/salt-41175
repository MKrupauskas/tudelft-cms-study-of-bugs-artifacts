### Description of Issue/Question
Given the following state:

```
update_cassandra:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: 'role:cassandra and env:dev'
    - tgt_type: compound
    - batch: 1
    - sls:
      - testsls
```


The tgt does not exist and will result in error: `No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.` but when running the state it returns the result as true as shown below:

```
[root@fadb14be2f20 /]# salt --version; salt-run state.orchestrate test
salt 2016.11.4 (Carbon)
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
