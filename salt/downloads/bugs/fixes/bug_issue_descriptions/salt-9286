I'm running salt version 0.17.2 in a IPv6 environment and trying to create a token via the API class results in the following error:

```
Exception AttributeError: "'SREQ' object has no attribute 'poller'" in <bound method SREQ.__del__ of <salt.payload.SREQ object at 0x2902d10>> ignored
```

After changing the code in `salt/auth/__init__.py` to use ip_brackets for the tcp connections it's working.

As there were many changes in `salt/auth/__init__.py` and I'm not able to run the current development version in our IPv6 environment, I'm not sure if the problem still exists.
But as I see from the code, there is still no use of salt.utils.ip_brackets in the method _send_token_request.

I think the code should look something like this:

```
