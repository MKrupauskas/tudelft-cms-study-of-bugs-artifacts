Testing `publisher_acl system` on the Oxygen branch fails.

I installed with the bootstrap script using this commit `3ed7a29c56e1ce9959113138c27fd601093a8e56`

I get this error 
```
Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

I see this in the master log:
```
2017-12-14 21:34:43,817 [salt.auth        :332 ][WARNING ][15612] Authentication failure of type "user" occurred.
2017-12-14 21:34:43,818 [salt.master      :1909][WARNING ][15612] Authentication failure of type "user" occurred.
```

I also see this in the master log:
```
2017-12-14 21:32:31,794 [salt.master      :617 ][ERROR   ][15589] Unable to load SSDP: asynchronous IO is not available.
2017-12-14 21:32:31,796 [salt.master      :619 ][ERROR   ][15589] You are using Python 2, please install "trollius" module to enable SSDP discovery.
```
Installing `trollius` did not help.

### Setup
Put this in the master config file:
```
publisher_acl:
  testuser:
    - .*
```

Add user and su into that user.

Modify the permission.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Try to run a command as the new user will fail with the `Failed to authenticate` message.
