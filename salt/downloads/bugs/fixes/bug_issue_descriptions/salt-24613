@jacksontj the commit 7c537cd9ece84adedce45e8da371a08f21291a25 is causing an issue in gevent code in a project I maintain that uses salt for it's zmq transport.

see http://lists.ceph.com/pipermail/ceph-calamari-ceph.com/2015-May/000107.html

The setup is that we receive an event from the minion 
https://github.com/ceph/calamari/blob/master/cthulhu/cthulhu/manager/cluster_monitor.py#L326

that there is new data to get which we ask for from the master with https://github.com/ceph/calamari/blob/master/cthulhu/cthulhu/manager/cluster_monitor.py#L109

our decorator https://github.com/ceph/calamari/blob/master/cthulhu/cthulhu/gevent_util.py#L10 notices that 7c537cd9ece84adedce45e8da371a08f21291a25 adds a self.get_event(wait=1)

This seems strange. I've tried to get a minimal reproducible case to include with this report and have failed. I welcome discussion about options at this point

thank you for your time.
