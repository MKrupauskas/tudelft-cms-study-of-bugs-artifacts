### Description of Issue/Question
Adding a nodegroup that references another nodegroup and uses compound matches can fail if the compounding happens on a YAML list line. (It might be possible that this is not limited to nodegroups)
It seems each list element is not treated as a compound.  If this is not a bug, then the documentation should be updated to make this clear.

The intent of the below nodegroup is to target all minions of a nodegroup, but then exclude some number of nodes from the group.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Nodegroups defined in /etc/salt/master.d/nodegroups.conf

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
**Fails:**
```
nodegroups:
  group1:
    - 'nodes*.com'
  group2:
    - 'N@group1 and not nodes3.com'

salt -N "group2" test.ping
[ERROR   ] Failed nodegroup expansion: unknown nodegroup "group2 and not nodes3.com"
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```


**Succeeds:**
```
nodegroups:
  group1:
    - 'nodes*.com'
  group2: 'N@group1 and not nodes3.com'
```

**Also Succeeds:**
```
nodegroups:
  group1:
    - 'nodes*.com'
  group2:
    - 'N@group1'
    - 'not'
    - 'nodes3.com'
```
