Running off a fresh Debian Wheezy 7.2 install (also verified on 7.1), the first highstate call on a masterless setup throws the same exception for almost all states using `file.py`:

```
----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /etc/mongodb.conf
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

On a second pass, everything behaves normally.
