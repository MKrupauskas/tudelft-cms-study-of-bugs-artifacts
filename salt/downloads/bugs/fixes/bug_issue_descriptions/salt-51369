When accepting or deleting a key on the head of 2019.2.0.rc1 branch I see the following error:

```
[root@ab52dd2043f2 testing]# salt-key -A -y
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
ab52dd2043f2
Key for minion ab52dd2043f2 accepted.
Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in <bound method IPCMessageClient.__del__ of <salt.transport.ipc.IPCMessageClient object at 0x7f5f0bbbd050>> ignored
```

```
[root@ab52dd2043f2 testing]# salt-key -D -y
The following keys are going to be deleted:
Accepted Keys:
ab52dd2043f2
Key for minion ab52dd2043f2 deleted.
Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in <bound method IPCMessageClient.__del__ of <salt.transport.ipc.IPCMessageClient object at 0x7fc64710bf90>> ignored
[root@ab52dd2043f2 testing]# 
```

It is working functionally just fine, but this error is seen each time.

running `salt-key -L` does not show the error:

```
[root@ab52dd2043f2 testing]# salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
[root@ab52dd2043f2 testing]# 
```

Here is a docker container to replicate the issue:

1. `docker run -it -v ~/git/salt/:/testing/ ch3ll/issues:ipc_typeerror /bin/bash` (where ~/git/salt/ is a local cloned git repo)

2. `salt-master -d; salt-minion -d` and then wait for the minion to start up

3. `salt-key -A -y`
