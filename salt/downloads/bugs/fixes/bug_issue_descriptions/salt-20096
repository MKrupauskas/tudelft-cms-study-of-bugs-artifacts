Take this state for example. This should enable multiverse. It will succeed when ran, but actually does not do anything.

``` yml
enable multiverse:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty multiverse
```

However, if I do an absent prior to the add, it'll actually work. It does not care if it is commented out or not:

``` yml
FIX enable multiverse:
  pkgrepo.absent:
    - name: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty multiverse

enable multiverse:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu trusty multiverse
    - require:
        - pkgrepo: FIX enable multiverse
```
