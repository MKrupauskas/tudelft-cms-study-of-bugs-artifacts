### Description of Issue/Question
I have a pillar, that's referencing a grain of the machine. When installing Salt 2016.11, it works just fine, but when we install Salt from the develop branch, it starts failing. The master doesn't seem to have access to the grains while rendering the pillar files. Querying the pillar from the command line or targeting in the top.sls file works just fine though.
I talked with @gtmanfred on #salt last Friday about the issue.

### Setup
This is a summary of our configuration and the content of the log files: https://gist.github.com/tobithiel/76f4652497b47318e4fec30f860e9808

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Fails when running `salt-call state.apply` on the minion or `sudo salt -G 'role:qa1' state.apply` on the master. On master-less minions, it works successfully though.
