With the release of API v1, the current instructions for using GCE with salt cloud no longer apply. ~~Namely, in the new google cloud console, there is nolonger an option to create server certificates.~~ But rather one creates an API key to interact with the API (relative to a project).
[The current docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/clouds/all/salt.cloud.clouds.gce.html#module-salt.cloud.clouds.gce) say there's a "Register App" button. Within the new developer console, this is no longer the case.
