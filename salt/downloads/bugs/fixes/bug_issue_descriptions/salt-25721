I noticed a strange error when I tried to write a state which manages `/etc/apache2/site-available/default-ssl.conf`.
The state failed with:

```
Permission denied for host <hostname>, do you want to deploy the salt-ssh key? (password required):
```

This can be more easily reproduced by simply reading the file from the remote system: `salt-ssh '*' -r 'cat /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf'` this gives also:

```
Permission denied for host <hostname>, do you want to deploy the salt-ssh key? (password required):
[Y/n]
```

I can read other files easily this way, and on the remote system, I can read the default-ssl.conf also with the user I'm using with salt-ssh, so it is not a permission problem.
It rather seems to me that something in this file is kind of interpreted by salt-ssh or during the transfer or so. Renaming the file and also moving into another location didn't help, so I guess it is related to the contents but couldn't find anything obvious which is causing this.

Version information:
- Client: `salt-ssh 2015.5.3 (Lithium)` installed in a virtualenv using pip
- Remote system: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

This might be related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18310#issuecomment-98094716 as the error message is the same.
