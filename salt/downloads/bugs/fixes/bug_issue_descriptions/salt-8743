When I call refresh_pillar, the minion fires signal to refresh_pillar and load the modules again.

When minion is reloading it's module, it becomes unresponsive during that time. To make it more strange, when I refresh_pillar to all my nodes (~60), they become unresponsive for almost a minute (reported by manage.down), so the more nodes is reloading the modules in parallel, the longer it takes for each individual node to come back.

Also, it's not just a timeout problem. When I fire test.ping (with high timeout value) to a node that is just reloading it's modules, it will never responce. Even tho test.ping calls called later are already served by that minion.

This bug becomes critical since one part of our system is heavily dependant on ext_pillar. So every time we programaticaly change the ext_pillar and call refresh_pillar to propage the change, all minons freezes for significant amount of time. Tried to turn off the ext_pillar, but the situation is the same. Basicaly it seems that the behaviour is same with refresh_pillar, or sync_modules calls. 

When I'm inspeckting the logs, during the time the node is unresponsive, I see loading of master.pki key (twice) and loading all the modules.
