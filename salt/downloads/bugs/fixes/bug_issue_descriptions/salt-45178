### libnacl missing from windows installers (was previously present)

### Setup
Generate a windows VM via salt-cloud, add solt via bootstrap.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Execute anything that uses salt.nacl - salt.acl.dec, etc. For ex. render a file with `superpassword={{salt.nacl.dec(pg_password)}}`

Error in logs:
```
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad nacl.dec: 'nacl' __virtual__ returned False: libnacl import error, perhaps missing python libnacl package
[ERROR   ] Rendering exception occurred: Jinja variable 'salt.utils.templates.AliasedLoader object' has no attribute 'nacl.dec'
[CRITICAL] Rendering SLS 'dev:core-software.databases.postgresql.win-pgsql' failed: Jinja variable 'salt.utils.templates.AliasedLoader object' has no attribute 'nacl.dec'
```

If pip shipped with salt used to install libnacl - `pip2 install libnacl` - everything works again

### Versions Report
Master is on latest CentOS 7 and salt 2017.7.2. It also seems to affect Py3 versions, however I did not look much into them.

Minion (windows version does not matter, after installing via pip libnacl is reported as installed):
