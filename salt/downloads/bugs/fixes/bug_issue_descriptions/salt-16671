As per #16504, trying to call a basic state via salt-ssh results in an error:

```
$ salt-ssh '*' state.sls test
example:
    An Exception occured while executing state.sls: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
```

The state file looks like this - nothing special:

```
{{ salt['pillar.get']('user') }}:
  user.present
```

The issue appears to be this line:  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/client/ssh/__init__.py#L744  as the `self.mods` variable is `None` when called from `salt.client.ssh.wrapper.state.sls`.

I'm not sure how to fix this, so over to someone who knows more about Salt than me.
