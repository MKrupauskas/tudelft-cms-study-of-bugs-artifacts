With the regular salt command, I can call a module like this:

`salt '*' some.func arg1 arg2 arg4=arg4`

The same with salt-run treats 'arg4=arg4' as the value for arg3.

I looked into how the minion is treating the args, and I see detect_kwargs in minion.py. I thought perhaps this same function could be used in runner.py, but am slightly unsure of how to go about it, as there are already other kwargs being passed to the runner function.
