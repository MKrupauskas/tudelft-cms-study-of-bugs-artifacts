For me the problem seems to be located in `salt.util.http.query()`, which (with [requests](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/http.py#L379), [tornado](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/http.py#L596) and [urllib2](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/http.py#L470)) tries to decode bytes to utf-8 in case you sit on py3. But `spm` wants to download an spm file, and...
