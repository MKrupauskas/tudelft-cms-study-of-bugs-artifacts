Been playing around with custom salt modules and grains along with salt-ssh. I found that any errors in the modules or grains aren't bubbled up and are ignored silently. The `-l debug` is useful but it would be great if the salt-ssh returns an non-zero exit code atleast as a hint that something went wrong.
