### Description of Issue/Question
Pillar overrides using salt-call fail to pass updated pillar information to ext_pillar.  salt, not salt-call, still works however.  This worked in 2016.11.7, but due to "fixes" in 2016.11.8, the functionality was broken.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
Using a command similar to the following and tracking the pillar information, you'll notice that the override status option isn't set.  Similarly, using simpler options of pillar='{{"foo": "bar"}}' doesn't change anything.
/usr/bin/salt-call state.highstate pillar='{"override":{"status": "on"}}'

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Install salt* 2016.11.7 and pass pillar overrides via salt-call, NOT salt.  Notice it works.  Update salt* to 2016.11.8 and redo test, you'll see it fails to work anymore.

It's worth mentioning I'm using an external pillar and if I log the results of pillar in 2016.11.8 vs. 2016.11.7, I see the following in my logs:
Oct 10 15:22:12 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX salt-master: [CRITICAL] PILLAR: {}
Oct 10 15:22:12 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX journal: 2017-10-10 15:22:12,667 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.roles][CRITICAL][26500] PILLAR: {}
Oct 10 15:24:04 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX salt-master: [CRITICAL] PILLAR: {}
Oct 10 15:24:04 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX journal: 2017-10-10 15:24:04,275 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.roles][CRITICAL][26631] PILLAR: {}
Oct 10 15:24:04 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX salt-master: [CRITICAL] PILLAR: {'override': {'status': 'on'}}
Oct 10 15:24:04 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX journal: 2017-10-10 15:24:04,942 [salt.loaded.ext.pillar.roles][CRITICAL][26632] PILLAR: {'override': {'status': 'on'}}

Oddly enough, running `/usr/bin/salt-call pillar.items pillar='{"override":{"status": "on"}}'` does show the override in there.  For now, I'm reverted back to 2016.11.7 due to this bug and the salt-api bug reported in #43581 which didn't start manifesting itself til upgrading to 2016.11.8.

BTW, if due to all the pillar override changes made in 2016.11.8, this changed the way pillar is passed to ext_pillar, could we get the documentation updated on how to utilize ext_pillar and pillar overrides, assuming that's even the root issue.
