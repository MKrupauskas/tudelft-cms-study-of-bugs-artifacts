### Description of Issue/Question
When using the puppet.fact module it runs the `facter` executable using `cmd.run`, this means that `stderr` gets merged into output. The module then tries to parse this. When `facter` encounters a non-fatal error it prints a message to `stderr` this then means that salt cannot interpret the output and the module execution fails.

I think parsing should only be done on stdout output, also facter now has `--json` flag for its output which may be easier to parse.
