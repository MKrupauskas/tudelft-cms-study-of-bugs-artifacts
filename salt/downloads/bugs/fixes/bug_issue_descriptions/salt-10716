I installed salt-minion 0.17.5-2-AMD64 on a fresh install of Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard. The service failed to start with errors about a missing assembly file.

Once I installed vcredist_x64 the service started. Can the required assembly file be added to the installer so this step is not required?

```

Please use sxstrace.exe for detailed diagnosis.
