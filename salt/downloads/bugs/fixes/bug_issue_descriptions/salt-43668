### Description of Issue/Question
When trying to use "parallel: True" with salt.runner and salt.state, I get a "RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded" error.

### Setup
orch.sls:
```
test-vm:
  salt.runner:
    - name: cloud.profile
    - prof: FreeBSD-2C-2G
    - provider: ovirt
    - instances:
      - Prod-Test-1.ocn.sh
    - opts:
        minion:
          master: Prod-Saltmaster-1.ocn.sh
    - parallel: True

test-setup:
  salt.state:
    - tgt: "Prod-Test-1.ocn.sh"
    - highstate: True
    - require:
      - salt: test-vm
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run the following command:
`salt-run -l debug state.orch orch.test saltenv=prod`

The following exception occurs:
```
[DEBUG   ] Runner return: Exception occurred in runner state.orch: Traceback (most recent call last):
