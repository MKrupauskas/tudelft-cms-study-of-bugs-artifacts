The Debian 8 repository `repo.saltstack.com/apt/debian/8/amd64/2015.5` is currently missing some development packages that cause errors to be throw when mirroring the repository.

``` bash
apt@XXXXX:~$ GNUPGHOME=/srv/XXXX-keyring-debmirror /usr/bin/debmirror --verbose --dist=jessie --section=main --host=repo.saltstack.com --arch=amd64 --method=http --rsync-extra=none -r /apt/debian/8/amd64/2015.5 /srv/XXXXXX-packages/saltstack/debian
Ed binary missing, falling back to --diff=none
Warning: --rsync-extra is not configured to mirror the trace files.
         This configuration is not recommended.

```

Current workaround is to ignore any `*-dev_` packages.
