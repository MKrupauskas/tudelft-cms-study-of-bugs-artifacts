The following state:

```
{% set files = salt['file.find']('/etc/xinetd.d', name='*', type='f') %}

{% for file in files %}
etc_xinetd_d_{{ file }}:
  file.replace:
    - name: {{ file }}
    - pattern: '\bdisable\s*=\s*no\b'
    - repl: 'disable = yes'
    - show_changes: True
    - flags: ['IGNORECASE']
    - backup: False
{% endfor %}
```

correctly renders expected as "No changes were made":

```
          ID: etc_xinetd_d_/etc/xinetd.d/chargen
    Function: file.replace
        Name: /etc/xinetd.d/chargen
      Result: True
     Comment: No changes were made
     Started: 16:56:26.569695
    Duration: 6.057 ms
     Changes:
```

However, unexpected is that all files are touched (note the identical time stamp):

```
host:/etc/xinetd.d # la
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  313 Dec  9 16:56 chargen
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  333 Dec  9 16:56 chargen-udp
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  409 Dec  9 16:56 cvs
....
```

The expected behavior is: if there was no change: to leave the file alone and untouched.

Furthermore: if  `backup: False` is omitted in the state, there are backup files to every file created (as well if salt reports "No changes were made"). As well I noted that  "append_if_not_found" will append if the match was found, so this sounds linked to #18612 (grows infinitely on append_if_not_found).

It appears to me, that the handling of a "no change" is not handled as expected.
