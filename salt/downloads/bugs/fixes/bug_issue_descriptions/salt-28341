I am about 80% sure that the initial highstate that the minion runs doesn't respect the returner.

Given these settings in /etc/salt/minion

``` #!yaml
startup_states: 'highstate'
return: statsd
```

I'm not seeing the above (custom) returner statsd being called. Even though I know it is on the system before hand and the minion file is correct when the run begins.
