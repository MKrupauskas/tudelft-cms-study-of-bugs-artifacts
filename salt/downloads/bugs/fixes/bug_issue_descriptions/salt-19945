In Salt 2014.7.0 the minion configuration look like this by default:

```
# If authentication fails due to SaltReqTimeoutError, continue without stopping the
# minion.
#auth_safemode: True
```

It seems like the default behaviour for a Salt minion is to try to reconnect after a SaltReqTimeoutError. Unfortunately this is not the case, I'm getting:

```
2015-01-22 09:18:10,001 [salt             ][ERROR   ] Attempt to authenticate with the salt master failed
```

and the minion service stops.

If I uncomment the stated line above in the minion configuration, it will work as intended and Salt minion is trying to reconnect every 60 seconds without stopping it's service.

```
2015-01-22 09:25:23,446 [salt.crypt       ][WARNING ] SaltReqTimeoutError: SaltReqTimeoutError: after 60 seconds, ran 1 tries
2015-01-22 09:26:33,477 [salt.crypt       ][WARNING ] SaltReqTimeoutError: SaltReqTimeoutError: after 60 seconds, ran 1 tries
â€¦
```

Since I guess it's a good thing that minions don't stop suddenly when the master is not available for a short time, please fix the default behaviour of Salt minions' auth_safemode.
