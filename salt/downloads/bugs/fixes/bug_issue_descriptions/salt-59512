### Description of Issue

I just upgraded my Saltstack master OS from Ubuntu 18.04 to Ubuntu 20.04, along with that upgrade came an upgrade of python from some 3.6 version to 3.8.5.
Salt itself seems to work fine. However not all parts of the saltstack code base seem to support newer "features" of the python language.
I have some scripts using salt's modules, more precise I do something like this:

``` python
...
client = salt.client.get_local_client()
...
job = client.run_job(target, command, arg, tgt_type=tgt_type,
        timeout=timeout, kwarg=kwarg)
...
for data in client.get_cli_returns(job["jid"], job["minions"], timeout=timeout):
    ...
```

It works on Ubuntu 18.04 (python 3.6) but breaks on Ubuntu 20.04 (python 3.8) with the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/client/__init__.py", line 1046, in get_cli_returns
    raise StopIteration()
StopIteration

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/run_tests", line 141, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "/usr/local/bin/run_tests", line 120, in main
    salt_master_run(args.target, "state.apply", ["unittests"], 
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt_helper.py", line 156, in salt_master_run
    for data in client.get_cli_returns(job["jid"], job["minions"],
RuntimeError: generator raised StopIteration
```

I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/51701040 on a quick search for `RuntimeError: generator raised StopIteration` and can confirm, that the following adjustment to /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/client/__init__.py fixes the issue:

```

Of course I guess this would break the code for older python versions, so I don't think this can be the final fix.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use `client.get_cli_returns` on python >= 3.7 (? reguarding to the stackoverflow topic I found, definitely on 3.8.5).
