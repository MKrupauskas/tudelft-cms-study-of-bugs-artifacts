In my environment we have configured a pre-auth banner using /etc/issue.net When using salt-ssh version 2014.1.11 (installed using pip) salt-ssh displays a retcode: 5, the stderr: is what is displayed in my banner, and stdout: is left blank. This happens when doing something simple like 'salt-ssh * test.ping'
