### Description of Issue/Question

After running `schedule.enable` or `schedule.disable`, one can no longer run `schedule.save` successfully until salt-minion is restarted. The error reported:
```
TypeError: 'bool' object is not iterable
````
I think this is because a key value pair `enabled: True` is added to the schedule data structure, at the same level as the jobs, so it is attempted to be treated as a job to save, but can not be processed successfully. I came across this error while searching for a way to set the global scheduling "enabled/disabled" state within the minion configuration.

### Setup
None

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Create any sort of schedule.
2. Run either `schedule.enable` or `schedule.disable`
3. Attempt to run `schedule.save` (this will result in error)

You can observe the added `enabled: <boolean>` by running `schedule.list show_all=True`.
