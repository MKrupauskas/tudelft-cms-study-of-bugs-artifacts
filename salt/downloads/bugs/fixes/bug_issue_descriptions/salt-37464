### Description of Issue/Question
I am trying to use the source_hash_update and if_missing parameters as an OR condition to determine if an archive should be extracted.  ie. If the source hash has changed _OR_ the target directory is missing then the state should execute and extract the archive again.

    - if_missing: /app/_some_artifact_

**Result:**
Archive is not extracted when using both source_hash_update and if_missing, and the source hash hasn't changed but the if_missing directory _IS_ missing.
