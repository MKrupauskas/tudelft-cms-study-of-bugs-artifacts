### Description of Issue/Question

I want to clone a repo using keys (id_rsa, id_rsa.pub, known_hosts) located in default location for a concrete user: C:\Users\admin.
There is `user` property in git.latest documentation. But when I try to use it I get:
`Failed to check remote refs: password is a required argument for runas on Windows`.
And there is no `password` property for git.latest unfortunately.
(`The following keyword arguments are not valid: password=...`)

And if I try to use `identity` I get:
Failed to check remote refs: Failed to find ssh.exe, unable to use identity file
but that bug already discussed here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/34237
### Setup

```
my_repo:
  git.latest:
    - name: git@some_repo.git
    - target: 'C:\some_folder'
    - user: admin
```
