When running one of my states from the command line with test=True, I receive an error:

```
[INFO    ] Executing state file.managed for /foo/bar.conf
[ERROR   ] Unable to cache file 'salt://foo/bar/conf.jinja' from saltenv 'base'.
[ERROR   ] An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1563, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/file.py", line 1406, in managed
    **kwargs
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/file.py", line 3129, in check_managed_changes
    __clean_tmp(sfn)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/file.py", line 84, in __clean_tmp
    if sfn.startswith(tempfile.gettempdir()):
AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'startswith'
```

However, running the state without test=True produced the expected result (in my particular case, an error that the source file didn't exist).
