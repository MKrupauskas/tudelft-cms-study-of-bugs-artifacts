Just getting started with Salt here and having an interesting issue with setting up a multi-master configuration, specifically in the attempt to have each master also be a minion of the multi-master setup.  So basically followed the information in http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/tutorials/multimaster.html for the two servers dsalt01.tag-dev.com and dsalt02.tag-dev.com, then on each machine set the 'masters' option in /etc/salt/minion as:

```
masters:
  - dsalt01.tag-dev.com
  - dsalt02.tag-dev.com
```

On each master, running "salt '*' test.ping" initially works by returning both masters (with 'True' as the result) with immediate return to command prompt, but then things get strange: one server will continue to do so, then the other will simply 'hang' for 5-10 seconds and return nothing, or only return one of the masters in the list.  Even stranger, this issue will bounce between the two masters so the other will start working while the former one working stops.  And sometimes both will simply refuse to return anything.

Turning up logging didn't reveal anything in either the master or minion logs, so I'm wondering if this is a supported configuration and I'm just missing something, or if this is a "don't do that" type of issue?  At the very least, being able to have the masters also be minions would be useful when trying to push out site-wide changes to all servers.

Please let me know if any further information is needed.
