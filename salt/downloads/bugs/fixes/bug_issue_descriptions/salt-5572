tested on salt 0.15.3-1precise

salt-call output:

```
[DEBUG   ] Rendered data from file: /tmp/absent.sls:
bleh:
  pkg:
    - purged
    - pkgs:
      - pyzor
      - razor

[INFO    ] Executing state pkg.purged for bleh
[WARNING ] "name" parameter will be ignored in favor of "pkgs"
```

what I expect.
but later:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'apt-get -q -y purge bleh' in directory '/home/ubuntu'
[ERROR   ] Command 'apt-get -q -y purge bleh' failed with return code: 100
[ERROR   ] stdout: Reading package lists...

[ERROR   ] stderr: E: Unable to locate package bleh
[ERROR   ] Error:  E: Unable to locate package bleh
```

but you said you ignored the name!

Output:

```
pkg_|-bleh_|-bleh_|-purged:

    changes:
