First of all, I wanna say that my experience so far with Salt have been great. The architecture and simplicity of things when you get a hang of it is remarkable!

I've waited a bit to post this issue because it's hard to reproduce consistently, but unfortunately it's a major roadblock from using Salt in production environments using Windows unless I'm missing something big. Actually there is two problems but I describe the connection issues here and I will open another issue for the other problem (bootstrapping, se #13070).

We have our servers running in Azure, so everything here applies to Azure environments, also it will hopefully give you  a good chance to replicate the environment. If not, contact me and you can have access to my environment

**The Salt Master**
Is running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (base image from Azure gallery) with only the Saltmaster installed.

**The Salt Minion**
Is running Windows Server 2012 R2 64 Bit (base image from Azure gallery) with the SaltMinon installed and whatever software I've tried to install via salt.

**The problem**
Connection drops quite often between the master and the minion, I'm working actively with the setup and maybe 1 out of 4 commands will get "the minion did not respond"/no output on the master. I am running the minion in console mode with -l debug.

Sometimes I see that the command reaches the minion and it works a bit. But many times it will not even reach the minions. 

I get the feeling that there is two problems:
- Something "crashes" the connection completely
- The minion "looses focus" and comes back after a while

My workarounds so far:
- Running with -t 300 (or any large number) helps sometimes for the second problem
- Running test.ping repteatadly sometimes seem to "wake up" the minion (other commands fail until the minion gets back)
- Restart the minion, give it a couple of seconds and then it comes back

Could #7159 be behind this maybe?

So, the stability in the connection prevents me from "trusting" that the minions do what I tell them to. Also the ability to call salt from scripts for automation is a no-go.

I wish I had more concrete information to give, but as I said, the environment is available to use if you want to see it for yourself.
