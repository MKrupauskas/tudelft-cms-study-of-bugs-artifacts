If i have the `wmi_provider` subdirectory of the git repo saltstack winrepo in my local masterless windows minions win_repo, and do a `salt-call -l debug --local winrepo.genrepo`` I get:

```
C:\salt>salt-call.exe --local -l debug winrepo.genrepo
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from c:\salt\conf\minion
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: c:\salt\conf\minion
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from c:\salt\conf\minion
[DEBUG   ] Mako not available
Passed invalid arguments: list indices must be integers, not str
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt/cli/caller.py", line 129, in call
  File "salt/modules/win_repo.py", line 79, in genrepo
TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str
```

This is another case where a mistake in sls recipes stops winrepo.genrepo from producing a new (even if incomplete) winrepo.p file. very similar to issue saltstack/salt #8157 https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/8157

the above mentioned culprit `wmi_provider` sls files do contain jinja in a windows sls file and that is (not yet) supported as logged in the comments to this commit here https://github.com/saltstack/salt-winrepo/commit/9afdab0dd03d51e92fc5064ad760c5357992966e . see saltstack/salt-winrepo issue #57 https://github.com/saltstack/salt-winrepo/issues/57 or saltstack/salt #6859 https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/6859
