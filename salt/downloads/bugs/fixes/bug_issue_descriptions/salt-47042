### Description of Issue/Question
Hello,

I got an issue with latest Saltstack release on Debian 9, while trying to deploy some binary files with `file.managed` : 

``` 
/opt/cni/bin/calico-ipam:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://k8s/src/cni/{{ calicoCNIversion }}/calico-ipam
    - skip_verify: true
    - group: root
    - mode: 755
```
That result : 

```
ID: /opt/cni/bin/calico-ipam
Function: file.managed
Result: False
Comment: Unable to manage file: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x99 in position 25: invalid start byte
Started: 09:48:20.232602
Duration: 1472.851 ms

```
And here is the debug trace : 

```

```
Here is the file : 

```
