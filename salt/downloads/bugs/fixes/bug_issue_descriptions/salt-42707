### Description of Issue/Question

FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE

```
root@fbsdssc:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules # salt-call --local service.start postfix
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/sbin/jexec None /usr/sbin/service postfix onestart' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: jexec: jail "None" not found
local:
    False
```

This machine has no jails at all--why would Salt try to execute the command in a jail named `"None"`?
