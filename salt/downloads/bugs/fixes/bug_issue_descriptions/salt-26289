I'm trying to start a container that doesn't exist. It fails to start my container. I believe it's because the container doesn't exist, and so `modules/dockerio._get_container_infos` is raising the exception. The `start` function in the same module is doing this:

```
    try:                                                                           
        dcontainer = _get_container_infos(container)['Id']                         
        if not is_running(container):                                              
            bindings = None          
```

I'm not sure if `_get_container_infos` is suppose to return info even if there is no container, or if start should be capturing the exception and starting the container... or something else.

But as far as I can tell, this won't ever work (though it might be due to a change in the docker-py API?)
