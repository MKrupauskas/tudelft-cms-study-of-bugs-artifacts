### Description of Issue/Question
We have a couple of `cmd.run` invocations calling a subprocess which will gladly notify `STOPPING=1`, causing systemd to enter the stop-sigterm state for the salt-minion service (killing it 90 seconds later).

### Setup

Debian with Salt 2018.3 (both master and minion).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Apply this state to kill your minions:

    sh -c 'echo "STOPPING=1" | nc -uU $NOTIFY_SOCKET':
      cmd.run:
      - bg: True

In our case the process doing this was `asterisk`.
