### Description of Issue/Question
Error will trip on any git-based pillar. For most this will be git_pillar, but notably it can also show up for a stacked pillar that relies on git_pillar like gitstack.

### Setup
The problem exists on a recent (as-of 20180525) 'develop' branch. I tested using a few versions going back over a few days but the most recent was https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/f9052346683865102bb47280f875cad5ad13fb7f

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Under the described conditions any attempt to access a pillar that incorporates git will product an error. 
```
[root@SALT ~]# salt-call pillar.items
local:
    ----------
    _errors:
        - Failed to load ext_pillar gitstack: 'Pygit2' object has no attribute 'base'
```

The error is trace-able to salt/utils/gitfs.py:2978 

As a temporary work-around I edit salt/utils/gitfs.py to ignore the faulty code. 
(excerpted below)
```
class GitPillar(GitBase):
    '''
    Functionality specific to the git external pillar
    '''
    role = 'git_pillar'

    def checkout(self):
        '''
        Checkout the targeted branches/tags from the git_pillar remotes
        '''
        self.pillar_dirs = OrderedDict()
        self.pillar_linked_dirs = []
        for repo in self.remotes:
            cachedir = self.do_checkout(repo)
            if cachedir is not None:
                # Figure out which environment this remote should be assigned
                if repo.env:
                    env = repo.env
                else:
                    #env = 'base' if repo.branch == repo.base else repo.branch
                    env = 'base'
                if repo._mountpoint:
                    if self.link_mountpoint(repo):
                        self.pillar_dirs[repo.linkdir] = env
                        self.pillar_linked_dirs.append(repo.linkdir)
                else:
                    self.pillar_dirs[cachedir] = envto ignore the faulty code.
```

This is an ugly hack and it's included only to help with pin-pointing a fix, not as any kind of example to emulate.
