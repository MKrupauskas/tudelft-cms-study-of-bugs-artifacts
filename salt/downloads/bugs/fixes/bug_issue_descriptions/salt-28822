Until 2015.5 this feature was working fine:

```
salt-call state.single file.managed /tmp/foo source='salt://templates/startscript.jinja?saltenv=meta'
```

Since 2018.8 the source file is not found anymore.
When I use 'env' instead of 'saltenv' a DeprecationWarning is returned that I should use 'saltenv' instead, but the file is not found either.
