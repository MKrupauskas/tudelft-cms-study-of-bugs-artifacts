### Description of Issue/Question

Multiple functions in the salt-cloud api provide no logging or return data whatsoever when their execution fails.  This makes it virtually impossible to troubleshoot the issue.
### Setup

Using salt python API to create instances using CloudClient.map_run() and CloudClient.create() with a very basic cloud map and profile.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create a profile and map file.
Start python repl

```
import salt
salt_client = salt.cloud.CloudClient('/etc/salt/cloud')
salt_client.map_run('myserver.map')
{}
salt_client.create(names=['torit'], provider='digital_ocean', kwargs={'slug': 'ubuntu-16-04-x64', 'size': '1g', 'region': 'tor1'})
False
```

As a user I expect these functions to report why something failed rather than failing silently.  If nothing else, return the raw provider/driver failure message downstream like "image doesn't exist" or "already running".  If a parameter is missing when executing the function raise an exception with a description of the issue.

The only way I can get any useful logging information is if I execute using salt-cloud which defeats the point of using the API.
