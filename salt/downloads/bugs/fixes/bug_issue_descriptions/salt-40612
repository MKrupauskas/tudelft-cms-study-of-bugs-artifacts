### Description of Issue/Question
When testing a state that uses the pkgrepo.managed function, a test=True will always return that the file is changing even though no change happens. Additionally, the modified timestamp on the server will change with every state apply, but the contents and sha256sum of the file DO NOT change.

```
$ salt 'testbox' state.apply my_atomic_repository test=True

  Name: /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-art - Function: file.managed - Result: Clean Started: - 19:07:09.703184 Duration: 29.09 ms
  Name: /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-atomicorp - Function: file.managed - Result: Clean Started: - 19:07:09.732422 Duration: 18.464 ms

    Function: pkgrepo.managed
        Name: atomic
      Result: None
     Comment: Package repo 'atomic' will be configured. This may cause pkg states to behave differently than stated if this action is repeated without test=True, due to the differences in the configured repositories.

You can see an example of multiple GPG keys in use over at http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/11966 too.

### Setup
```
atomic-repo-{{ grains['osmajorrelease'] }}:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: atomic
    - humanname: "Atomic Linux Repository"
    - baseurl: {{ yum_repo }}/atomic-{{ grains['osmajorrelease'] }}/
    - gpgkey: |
        file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-art
               file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-atomicorp
    - gpgcheck: 1
    - enabled: 1
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
salt 'testbox' state.apply my_atomic_repository
salt 'testbox' state.apply my_atomic_repository test=True
```
