I have the following grain structure:

```
foo:
  bar: 'abc'
```

I want to set `foo:bar` to `something`. How do I do it using present functions in `salt.states.grains`? 

I tried the following but it didn't work:

**State**:

```
Set the grain:
  grains.present:
    - name: foo:bar
    - value: something
```

**Result**:

```
foo:bar:
    something
```

**State**:

```
Set the grain:
  grains.present:
    - name: foo['bar']
    - value: something
```

**Result**:

```
foo['bar]':
    something
```

I had filed a similar issue before at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/18506 but no work has been done on it.
