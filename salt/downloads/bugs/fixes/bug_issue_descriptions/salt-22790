The `jobs.lookup_jid` command throws a traceback when the `missing` argument is given:

```
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20150417095737727318 missing=True
```

...returns the following traceback.

``` python
Exception occurred in runner jobs.lookup_jid: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/shouse/src/salt/salt/salt/client/mixins.py", line 317, in low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/Users/shouse/src/salt/salt/salt/runners/jobs.py", line 131, in lookup_jid
    exp = ckminions.check_minions(data['tgt'], data['tgt_type'])
KeyError: 'tgt'
```

Guess this isn't being widely used; it's been broken for a while. Tested on 2014.7, 2015.2, develop.
