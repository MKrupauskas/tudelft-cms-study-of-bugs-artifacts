When specifying the size in a map file instead of the profile configuration file I receive and error when trying to create/provision the VM. Here is my test case:

/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/amazon.conf

When I run `sudo salt-cloud -m /srv/salt/states/test-map.sls -ldebug` I receive the following error:

I also tested this in 2015.8.5 and received the same error. This was previously working in the 2015.5 branch. I tested 2015.5.3 and 2015.5.9 tags and it was able to create the VM with no error.
