I started having strange issue since upgraded to 2014.1 I think
I have "Minion did not return" message on master and successfully applied (some) states on minion. So if there is some error I don't know where and have to search debug minion log
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid is not returning anything (just newline after few mins of hanging)
salt 'minion' cmd.run uname returns output
salt 'minion' test.ping also returns true
Not all minions are affected.
I tried to increase timeout on master, remove cache on minion
Upgrading both master and minion from 2014.1 to 2014.3 and than to 2014.4 didn't helped
This is reproducible for me, would be glad to help with any additional debugging
