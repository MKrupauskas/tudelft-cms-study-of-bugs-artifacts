### Description of Issue/Question

the syslog_ng module in it's current state is not really useful for me as it does change something on the system every time I run the state. The module should first check the current situation and only in case of a change run something against the target system.

Maybe the original developer of the module can say something about it: @ihrwein
### Setup

My sls file contains the following:

```
source.s_localhost:
  syslog_ng.config:
    - config:
      - tcp:
        - ip: "127.0.0.1"
        - port: 1233
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

use something like the above sls configuration and apply a change 2-3 times against a minion. you will get the following output **every time** you run it:

```
my-secret-server-name:
----------
          ID: source.s_localhost
    Function: syslog_ng.config
      Result: True

                      tcp(
                          ip(
                              127.0.0.1
                          ),
                          port(
                              1233
                          )
                      );
                  };
              old:

Summary for my-secret-server-name
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
```

What i would expect is that the first run against a minion does return something like above. but every subsequent run should return a clean result:

```
my-secret-server-name:
  Name: source.s_localhost - Function: syslog_ng.config - Result: Clean

Summary for my-secret-server-name
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
```
