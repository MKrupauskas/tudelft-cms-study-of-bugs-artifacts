While the SSH ConnectTimeout is set it only bounds the SSH connection time.  Once the SSH connection completes the process can block forever:

```
>$ salt-ssh 'c903.qc' -r 'while :; do sleep 10; done'

```

The above never returns because it completes the SSH connection and is an infinite loop.

```
$ salt-ssh 'ftp901.qc' -r 'while :; do sleep 10; done'
ftp901.qc:
    ----------
    retcode:
        1
    stderr:
        ssh: connect to host ftp902.qc port 22: No route to host

    stdout:

```

The above completes because the ftp902.qc is offline and the SSH connection never completes.

Patch forthcoming.
