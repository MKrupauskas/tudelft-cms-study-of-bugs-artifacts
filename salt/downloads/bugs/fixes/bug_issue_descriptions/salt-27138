Hello,

I'm getting the following exception when trying to do external_auth: ldap with LDAP (FreeIPA 3.x to be more precise):

Output of salt-master -l all

```
Results of YAML rendering:
{}
[TRACE   ] AES payload received with command _mine
[TRACE   ] Master function call _mine took 0.00154590606689 seconds
[INFO    ] Clear payload received with command publish
[DEBUG   ] Attempting LDAP bind with user dn: uid=joeschmoe,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=company,dc=com
[DEBUG   ] Successfully authenticated user dn via LDAP: uid=joeschmoe,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=company,dc=com
[DEBUG   ] ldap bind to determine group membership succeeded!
[ERROR   ] Exception occurred while authenticating: 'dict' object has no attribute 'endswith'
```

I get this after running:

```
salt -a ldap 'hostname' test.ping
Failed to authenticate! This is most likely because this user is not permitted to execute commands, but there is a small possibility that a disk error occurred (check disk/inode usage).
```

Clearly the auth portion works but it just chokes on something afterwards and I'm not sure what.  I figure it does this when trying to gather groups that my user is part of.

/etc/salt/master snippet:
