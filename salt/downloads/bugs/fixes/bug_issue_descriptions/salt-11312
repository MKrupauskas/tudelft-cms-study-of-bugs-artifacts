When calling events with no data, like so:

```
salt-call event.fire_master '{}' 'test'
```

or

```
salt-call event.fire_master '' 'test'
```

But passing a fake dict as the data arg and the event gets picked up fine by the master:

```
salt-call event.fire_master '{"foo":"bar"}' 'test'
```

It would be nice not to have to pass in data if it isn't needed for the event.
