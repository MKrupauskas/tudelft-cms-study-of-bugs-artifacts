I'm new to salt, so I apologize if this is just a mis-understanding. I'm trying to get my minion's id and fqnd in the /etc/hosts file, but salt thinks nothing needs to be done.

I have the following:
a minion on Ubuntu 14.04
/etc/hostname: minion1.example.com
/etc/hosts:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
```

and the following state:

```
{%- set fqdn = grains['fqdn'] %}
{%- set host = grains['id'] %}
{%- set localip = grains['fqdn_ip4'] %}

{{ fqdn }}-hosts-entry:
  host.present:
    - ip: {{ localip }}
    - names:
      - {{ host }}
      - {{ fqdn }}
```

which results in:

```
minion1.example.com-hosts-entry:
  host.present:
    - ip: 127.0.0.1
    - names:
      - minion1
      - minion1.example.com
```

and I would expect those to get added to the /etc/hosts, but the host file doesn't change. Salt stack seems to think nothing is needed to be done...

```
----------
          ID: minion1.example.com-hosts-entry
    Function: host.present
        Name: minion1.example.com
      Result: None

Look at the salt-call on the minion, i see:

```
[INFO    ] Running state [minion1.example.com] at time 20:18:32.486865
[INFO    ] Executing state host.present for minion1.example.com
[INFO    ] No changes made for minion1.example.com
[INFO    ] Completed state [minion1.example.com] at time 20:18:32.487676
```

what I would expect would be a file like:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost minion1 minion1.example.com

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
```

Note the line above is: **127.0.0.1 localhost minion1 minion1.example.com**

Without those items in the /etc/hosts file, things such as 
- ping minion1
- ping minion1.example.com
  fail to resolve
