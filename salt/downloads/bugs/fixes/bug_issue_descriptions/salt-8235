I'm currently trying to tests requisites, and to read to code (ouch).
Found a strange thing in state.py `requisite_in`, https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/state.py#L1080 the state is handled when not used in a yaml list syntax.

<pre>
if isinstance(items, dict):
</pre>

Then https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/state.py#L1107 it is checked for lists.

<pre>
if isinstance(items, list):
</pre>

 And  https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/state.py#L1117-1190 `prereq_in`,`prereq`,`use_in` and `use` are handled. So, **only when used in list mode**.

Tested with use:

<pre>
A:
  cmd.run:
    - name:
        pwd
    - cwd: /tmp
B:
  cmd.run:
    - name:
        pwd
  # here used without "-"
    - use:
        cmd: A
C:
  cmd.run:
    - name:
        pwd
    - use:
        - cmd: A
</pre>

Resulting in `/tmp`, `/root` and `/tmp`, instead of 3 `/tmp`.

With `prereq` final result is a StackTrace with **TypeError: string indices must be integers, not str**. With `require` a nice error message tells me to enforce list syntax.
