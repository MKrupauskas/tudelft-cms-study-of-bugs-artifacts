### Description of Issue/Question
The memory usage of Reactor continues to grow.

I've checked https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/37938 and solution for that issue is already part of our salt-master version/install.

### Setup
> Reactor configuration - 
```
reactor:
  - 'salt/job/*/ret/*':
    - /srv/reactor/module_jobs.sls
```
> cat /srv/reactor/module_jobs.sls
```
salt/job/*/ret/*:
  runner.test.arg:
    - args: ["1"]
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use ```watch -n 1 'salt \* test.ping' ``` to cause reactor to get involved.

More nodes you've faster it grows. Even after test is stopped... the memory stays high and does not go down.

``` ps -uq $(pgrep -f Reactor)``` Note - Have setproctitle installed to match on Reactor name.

In my case with a single minion (on salt-master), the memory utilization of Reactor went up from 9% to 15% in 1 hour.
