If you run `salt-call state.highstate test=True` and the state contains a `rabbitmq_user.present` it always results in an item marked as "to be changed":

```
----------
          ID: rabbitmq_user_userxyz
    Function: rabbitmq_user.present
        Name: userxyz
      Result: None
     Comment: User userxyz already presents
     Started: 10:10:31.939836
    Duration: 392.501 ms
     Changes:   
```

Most likely the `result: None` should be changed to `result: True` in case the user already exists. The same is the case for other states (e.g. `service.running`)

The same applies to `rabbitmq_vhost.present` states which also return `None` rather than `True`
