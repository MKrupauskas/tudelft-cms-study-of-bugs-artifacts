Hi,

While testing salt-cloud's proxmox provider I've found I cant destroy/delete a host due to the following error: There was an error destroying machines: 501 Server Error: Method 'DELETE /nodes/pmx1/openvz/openvz/100' not implemented

By looking at the request it looks like 'openvz' is being passed twice as part of the resource URI.

I think I've spotted the error and I will be sending a pull-req soon. Let this issue serve as marker for it.
