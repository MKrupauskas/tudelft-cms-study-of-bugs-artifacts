Hi!

I just upgraded to 2016.3.3 and ran a state.highstate on my master (and also on a local vm with salt-call --local for testing). Master and Minions are on 2016.3.3. Further I use state_output=changes and state_verbose=True for my output formatting within the highstate.

With 2016.3.2 and earlier the output worked just like the documentation states:
By default state_verbose is set to True, setting this to False will instruct the highstate outputter to omit displaying anything in green, this means that nothing with a result of True and no changes will not be printed
If changes is used, then terse output will be used if there was no error and no changes, otherwise full output will be used.

So for every state which returns True I get one line and for everything else I get the full output.

With 2016.3.3 and the same settings I get a kinda new, strange and confusing output formatting like this:

```
    service_|-ssh-service_|-ssh_|-running:
        ----------
        __id__:
            ssh-service
        __run_num__:
            9
        changes:
            ----------
        comment:
            The service ssh is already running
        duration:
            25.735
        name:
            ssh
        result:
            True
        start_time:
            15:10:52.798773
```

If I turn of state_verbose and set it to False the formatting gets back to normal but I loose everything which returns True in the output.
