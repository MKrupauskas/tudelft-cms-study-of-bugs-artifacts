I'm experiencing an issue with Salt's compound matching. I've got a machine named `qa-tool-util`. It has the following grains, among others not displayed:

```
environment: qa
role:
  - kibana
```

Querying for the `role` and `environment` grain through salt shows everything's good.

```
# qa-tool-util has the "kibana" role
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "qa-tool-util" grains.get role
qa-tool-util:
...
    - kibana
...

# qa-tool-util is in the "qa" environment
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "qa-tool-util" grains.get environment
qa-tool-util:
    qa
```

Using a compound matcher to select by either of those grains works:

```
# Matcher for just role works.
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "G@role:kibana" test.ping
...
qa-tool-util:
    True
...

# Matcher for just environment works.
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "G@environment:qa" test.ping | grep tool-util
qa-tool-util:
```

Using a compound matcher specifying both of those grains matches no minions: 

```
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "G@role:kibana and G@environment:qa" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received

# Opposite conditions, same thing.
my_user@salt-master:~$ sudo salt -C "G@environment:qa and G@role:kibana" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
