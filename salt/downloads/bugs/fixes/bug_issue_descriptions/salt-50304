### Description of Issue/Question

Very slow salt-master start under a NIS/YP environment.

During the start up there is a check for ACL that implies a call to `pwd.getpwall()` in order to get all the users available in the system:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/daemons/masterapi.py#L241

If the system is under NIS/YP, this call will require some network access and some request to external services, that can slow down the master start. In my current system this is more than two minutes, but is a variable measure.

I realized that under the same system a call for `pwd.getpwnam()` is very fast, for existing and non existing users.

I think that the iteration needs to be changed, in order to reverse the query, from the acl list to the users in the system.
