Since updating from 2014.1.7 to 2014.7.1, we are seeing a large number (like, tens of thousands per day) of messages in the master log like the following:

`2015-01-28 14:08:35,600 [salt.loaded.int.returner.local_cache       ][ERROR   ] An inconsistency occurred, a job was received with a job id that is not present in the local cache: 20150128140503219478`

We run multi-master with 4 masters, all listed in every minion's config.

In issue #18322, @basepi suggested this was probably due to some changes in multi-master in the 2014.7 timeframe and should be fixed. I just wanted to formally open an issue so it's not lost.
