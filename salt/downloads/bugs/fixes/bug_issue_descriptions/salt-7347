I installed Saltstack on both Ubuntu and CentOS (6.4).  On CentOS, initiating a state.highstate results in random hangs on the minions shown with state.running:
- The function "state.highstate" is running as PID 18383 and was started at 2013, Sep 05 16:49:30.883503 with jid 20130905164930883503

I can clear it by logging in to the minion and killing that process, but during each run about 4 out of my 8 minions hang.  This is a new setup with very little to do but copy authorized_keys.
