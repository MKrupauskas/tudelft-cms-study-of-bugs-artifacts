### Description of Issue/Question

There is no way to specify a ddns.present state with rdtype = 'NS' that doesn't result in  'changed' status even if the record exists.

With the name parameter set to '@' the record is created if missing but the state always returns changed. Using the zone name or an empty string results in an error:

```
          ID: ddns_ns_record
    Function: ddns.present
        Name: internal.example.com
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1733, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1652, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/ddns.py", line 71, in present
                  status = __salt__['ddns.update'](zone, name, ttl, rdtype, data, **kwargs)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/ddns.py", line 166, in update
                  request = dns.message.make_query(fqdn, rdtype)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dns/message.py", line 1058, in make_query
                  qname = dns.name.from_text(qname)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dns/name.py", line 654, in from_text
                  raise EmptyLabel
              EmptyLabel: A DNS label is empty.
     Started: 21:12:34.761215
    Duration: 2.247 ms
     Changes:   
```

I also tried using the unqualified host name 'dns01' as the data parameter, with the same results. Including or omitting the trailing dot in the the zone name also has no effect.
### Setup

```
ddns_ns_record:
  ddns.present:
    - name: '@'
    - zone: 'internal.example.com'
    - data: 'dns01.internal.example.com.'
    - rdtype: 'NS'
    - ttl: 300
    - nameserver: '192.168.100.10'
    - keyfile: '/etc/rndc.key.json'
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Repeatedly invoke the same ddns.present state with rdtype = 'NS'
