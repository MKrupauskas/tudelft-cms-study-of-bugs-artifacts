### Description of Issue/Question

In salt/salt/netapi/rest_tornado/saltnado.py RunSaltAPIHandler.post() method, it passes the payload directly to self.disbatch() method, and the token validation is not happening in the downstream. That results in anyone can call the /run REST API without authentication. Though the client=local_async will just return the jid and /jobs REST API requires token, the job has already been sent to the master. And client=local is the worst case that both takes in commands and returns the result without token.

Also, the way for authentication failure is not quite the standard way usually used by REST convention. Instead of return a 401 Unauthorized, a 301 Redirect to /login is returned. I think this message can be returned in the body of 401 return.
### Setup

Start salt-api with rest_tornado implementation as stated on the document.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

File a /run POST payload without token, and the request get accepted.
