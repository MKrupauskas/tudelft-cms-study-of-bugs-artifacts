I installed the salt-master using the develop branch before 0.17 was officially released. I hoped to upgrade to 0.17 stable using the curl method:

curl -L http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh -s -- -M -N git 0.17

But currently that fails with:

error: package directory 'salt/templates' does not exist

```
 * ERROR: Failed to run install_ubuntu_git()!!!
```

Running setup.py install manually results in this error:

```
0.17.0-65-gbb65777
running install
running build
running build_py
error: package directory 'salt/templates' does not exist
```

Is there a preferred method from going from the develop branch to the stable 0.17 branch?
