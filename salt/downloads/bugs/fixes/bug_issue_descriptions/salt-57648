**Description**
I have a master configured with `auto_accept`. After using salt-cloud to deploy to a windows minion. The minion is first started in a "bootstrap" environment which is used to install some additional configuration such as upgrading the version of python and and configuring the etcd returner. Once that's complete, it switches to the "base" environment and reboots the machine. (edited) Upon failure it reboots and tries again..because windows (/edited)

Upon restarting the machine, it's unable to authenticate to the master. Looking at `salt-key` on the master, it seems that the same public key for the minion has now appeared in both the "Accepted Keys" and "Denied Keys" groups.

What situation would result in the key being categorized as a "Denied Keys"?

**Setup**
The master and bootstrap environment that's executed on the minion is the following, but it's very basic. salt-cloud is responsible for dropping the minion key (which appears correct on the minion and master)

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Set the default environment to bootstrap, apply these states..reboot. (edited) I haven't done much research in this area, however. (/edited)

**Expected behavior**
As the keys haven't changed, one would expect the minion to still be able to authenticate. As the master is in auto-accept, the public key should be accepted.
