### Description of Issue/Question

The execution of _salt-ssh_ with the option _--askpass_ fails with return code 255 even if I enter the password correctly.

### Setup
I set up the salt master as described in [Installing Salt For Development](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/topics/development/hacking.html#too-long-socket-path)
Additionally I started a Ubuntu VM with ssh server configured to accept password authentication.

The _roster_ file has the following content:
```
ubuntu_desktop:
  host: <ip address>
  user: <username>
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Following are the commands I entered (including the following prompts):
```
$ salt-ssh -c ./etc/salt/ --no-host-keys --askpass '*' test.ping
Password: <I entered my valid ssh password for the user>
Permission denied for host ubuntu_desktop, do you want to deploy the salt-ssh key? (password required):
[Y/n] n
ubuntu_desktop:
    ----------
    retcode:
        255
    stderr:
        Warning: Permanently added '<ip address of host>' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
        Permission denied (publickey,password).
    stdout:
```

Oddly enough, if I answer the question about deploying keys with _yes_, I get another password prompt: 
```
Password for <user>@<hostname>: <I entered the password again>
```
Now the login was successful and a key was deployed. 
The module _test.ping_ returns 
```
ubuntu_desktop:
    True
```
