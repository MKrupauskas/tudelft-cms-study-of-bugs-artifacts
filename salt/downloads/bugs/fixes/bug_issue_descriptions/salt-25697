I have the following setup here:
- Fedora 22 in VirtualBox 5.0
- Ubuntu 15.04 inside a systemd-nspawn container (systemd 219)
- Salt 2015.5.2 in this Ubuntu/systemd-nspawn container

The `virtual` grain returns `VirtualBox` because it uses `osdata.get('productname', '')` first which returns `VirtualBox` and then doesn't even query `virt-what` anymore.
It should return `lxc` (as reported by `virt-what` instead).
