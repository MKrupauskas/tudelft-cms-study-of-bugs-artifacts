#### Summary:

Minion will generate two minion keys under certain race conditions, which results in salt-minion with a key that will never work until you delete and re-add the key on salt-master.
#### Description:

If you start salt-minion and run a salt call, for example salt-call state.highstate; or from master, salt 'dev.test' state.highstate, the minion will generate two minion keys. Both the salt-minion and the salt call will generate minion keys instead of just one of them. The salt function will usually over write the minion daemon's key, but the minion already sent a message to salt-master before the overwrite. Because of this, you need to delete the key on salt-master and add the new key.
Under certain conditions, I have added the first key with salt-key and then ran "salt 'dev.test' state.highstate" and it also generated another minion key. This happens if you add the key and then run highstate really quickly.
#### Steps to Reproduce: Run the following script on a vagrant box.

**salt_crit.sh**
# !/bin/bash

apt-get update
apt-get install -y salt-master salt-minion
echo "master: 10.0.2.15" > /etc/salt/minion.d/master.conf
/etc/init.d/salt-minion stop
salt-minion start -l trace &>/tmp/salt-minion.log &
salt-call state.highstate -l trace &> /tmp/highstate.log &
