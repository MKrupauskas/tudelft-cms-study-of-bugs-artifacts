Breifly: check files for being ASCII-only or somehow catch this error from Yaml renderer and report it in obvious way.

Spent 3 hrs this night searching what caused this result:

```
$ salt minion state.highstate test=True
minion:
----------
    State: - no
    Name:      states
    Function:  None
        Result:    False
        Comment:   No Top file or external nodes data matches found
        Changes:
```

finally found that I had a first comment line in russian in top.sls file.

Okay, I see it is forbidden http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/troubleshooting/yaml_idiosyncrasies.html#yaml-support-only-plain-ascii

But yaml renderer just fails silently â€” i've traced the code and it returns en empty dict with no warning.

This is something awkward.
Please consider to add an ASCII-only check for .sls files so no beginner in the future will spend 3 hours searching for what's wrong with his states.
