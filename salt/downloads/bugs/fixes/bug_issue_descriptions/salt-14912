What causes the problem:
1. Configure a salt master and a salt minion
2. Configure the salt master with one state in the top.sls file. The single state includes many other states based on the pillar and grains.
3. Through the logic in the single state in the top.sls file, it includes a state that does not exist.

What I expect to see:
- An error message that tells me the state the salt master attempts to load and does not exist.

What I get instead:
- An error message that tells me the single state from the top.sls file. Here is what it looks like:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'role' in env 'base'
```

'role' is the single state that exists in top.sls. The actual role that failed is included by the 'role' state and it is not called 'role'.
