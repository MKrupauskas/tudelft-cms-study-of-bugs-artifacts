### Description of Issue/Question

Starting latest MySQL community edition hangs (waits) indefinitly  both via cmd.run and service states. Actual service is started and running.

This looks like a recent change in latest MySQL releases, for example: https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/commit/684a165f28b3718160a3e4c5ebd18a465d85e97c#diff-26228c60f7753d111a177fa638fb5838R283

Affects 5.5.52, 5.6.33, 5.7.15. Switching to previous releases - 51, 32 and 14 resolves the issue.

In general quite a lot of commands ending with `>/dev/null 2>&1 &` were changed to `>/dev/null &`, stating security reasons which looks dubious to me.

While this might be MySQL bug, if you run manually from command line "service mysqld start" it works - either via bash or sh. Feel free to close if MySQL, though looks like if it is executed via command line it also should work in salt.

Does not affect CentOS7 (presumably because of systemd)
### Setup

These states hang:

```
mysql57-service:
  service.running:
    - name: mysqld
    - enable: True
```

```
mysql55-service:
  cmd.run:
    - name: service mysqld start; chkconfig mysqld on; sleep 5
    - shell: /bin/bash
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Try starting mysqld via service or cmd states via salt. State executes indefinitely.  Actual service is started and running.
If executed via `service mysqld start` - exit code is 0 and service is started.
