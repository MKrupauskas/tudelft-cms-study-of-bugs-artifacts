### Description of Issue/Question

The state vault.policy_present does not seem to work with Salt 2018.3.0.

### Setup

Latest Salt on master and minion, running vault on the master that's also a minion ;)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

salt skynet state.apply local.vault

```
skynet:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1600, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 748, in apply_
        return sls(mods, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/state.py", line 1278, in sls
        ret = st_.state.call_high(high_, orchestration_jid)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2706, in call_high
        ret = self.call_chunks(chunks)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2096, in call_chunks
        running = self.call_chunk(low, running, chunks)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2610, in call_chunk
        self.event(running[tag], len(chunks), fire_event=low.get('fire_event'))
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 2396, in event
        [self.jid, 'prog', self.opts['id'], six.text_type(chunk_ret['__run_num__'])], 'job'
    KeyError: u'__run_num__'
```

local.vault

```
vault_policy_read_only:
  vault.policy_present:
    - name: read-only
    - rules: |
        path "*" {
          capabilities = ["read", "list"]
        }

```
