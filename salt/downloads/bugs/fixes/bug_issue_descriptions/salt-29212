I can't tell if spm remove is actually working or what should be happening.

Running spm remove apache, for example, doesn't remove any of the .spm packages, cache files, metadata files or /srv/spm/salt files associated with the apache .spm package. I'm expecting at least some of these files to get removed, but could be wrong.

I certainly could have the wrong expectation on what the remove function should be doing.
