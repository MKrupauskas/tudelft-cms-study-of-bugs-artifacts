The new state file.line seems to be buggy in 2015.8.0. I have a simple test.cfg file with the following two lines of content:

tst.cfg:

```
    line1=“first“
    line2=“secnd“
```

and this state for testing:

```
    test:
      file.line: 
       - name: /tmp/test.cfg 
       - content: 'line2="second fixed"' 
       - match: 'line2=' 
       - mode: 'replace' 
```

Executing highstate test=True, the log shows a) a strange diff with replacing the whole file instead of patching only the one targeted line, and b) the new content is shown on only one line. And c), test dry-run is ignored, the changes are applied to the file.

```
              ID: test
        Function: file.line 
            Name: /tmp/test.cfg 
          Result: None

test.cfg is altered after highstate test=True as if run without testing.

```
    line1="first"
    line2="second fixed"
```
