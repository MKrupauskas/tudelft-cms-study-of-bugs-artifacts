### Description of Issue/Question

Restarted salt-master yesterday afternoon. This morning:

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root     17529  0.6 26.2 8971700 8648380 ?     Sl   Sep26   6:33 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/salt-master ZeroMQPubServerChannel
```

Note 26.2% memory usage on a 32G Amazon instance is about 8GB. Captured a coredump in the hopes this will be useful. Restart salt-master, wait a few hours for it to stabilize:

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root     21123  0.3  2.5 1217244 833700 ?      Sl   17:29   0:12 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/salt-master ZeroMQPubServerChannel
```

Note 2.5% memory usage.
### Setup

I'm not sure what specific stuff in our setup is relevant. We just switched back from TCP to 0mq transports. I'm pretty sure we have a couple of machines that didn't get re-configured (the reason we're switching is that we needed more reliable behavior).
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

We have about 500 minions connected with 0mq. I'm guessing we still have a few that are trying to connect with TCP, which I'll be hunting down today. Hopefully eliminating them will eliminate the issue, in which case I'll update the issue description and title.
