### Description of Issue/Question

`state.sls` and `state.show_sls` treat `saltenv` parameter differently which creates inconsistent behavior.  `state.sls` defaults saltenv into `None` and then if user did not provide any value in the command line it figures it out from `__opts__`. `state.show_sls` defaults `saltenv` to `base` instead.

### Setup
Any standard Salt setup with several environments. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run `state.sls` and `state.show_sls` without specifying saletenv.
