Just like the title says, it does not result in a new file. And not only that. It also completely eradicates any output. 
As advised by @rallytime in the post https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/20629#issuecomment-74272510 I added the line 

```
output_file: /var/log/salt/highstate_output.yaml
```

to the config. I still see the output of salt-call state.highstate on the shell but the output from:

```
manage.status
list-key -L
'*' test.ping 
```

is completely gone. The master still speaks with the minions. I can see the request going in on the minions but the master doesn't show it anymore. So I'd say this is the complete opposite effect of what this feature is supposed to do and I'd therefore like to open a bug-report.
