After building salt 2014.1.3 on build.opensuse.org I found these new rpmlint issues:

RPMLINT report:

```
[  447s] salt-doc.noarch: W: wrong-file-end-of-line-encoding /usr/share/doc/packages/salt-doc/html/_static/jquery.js
[  447s] This file has wrong end-of-line encoding, usually caused by creation or
[  447s] modification on a non-Unix system. It could prevent it from being displayed
[  447s] correctly in some circumstances.
```

```
[  447s] salt.noarch: W: non-executable-script /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/zcbuildout.py 0644L /usr/bin/env
[  447s] salt.noarch: W: non-executable-script /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/templates/debian_ip/route_eth.jinja 0644L /bin/sh
[  447s] salt.noarch: W: non-executable-script /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/dockerio.py 0644L /usr/bin/env
[  447s] This text file contains a shebang or is located in a path dedicated for
[  447s] executables, but lacks the executable bits and cannot thus be executed.  If
[  447s] the file is meant to be an executable script, add the executable bits,
[  447s] otherwise remove the shebang or move the file elsewhere.
```
