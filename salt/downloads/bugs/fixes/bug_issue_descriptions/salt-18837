I am running the current 2014.7.0 package from the saltack debian repositories. When calling salt-call I get twice the following message.

```
[ERROR   ] Failed to read the virtual function for module: apt
Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError: The warning triggered on filename '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py', line number 1100, is supposed to be shown until version 2014.1.0 (Hydrogen) is released. Current version is now 2014.7.0 (Helium). Please remove the warning.
```

Seems to have not impact on the functionality of the aptpkg module, since I can still use it. But it would be nice to get rid of it.
