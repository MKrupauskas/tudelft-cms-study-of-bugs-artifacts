### Description of Issue/Question

Using `cron.rm_job` (or related features like the `cron.absent` state) create empty crontabs when no crontab exists. I think it makes more sense to do nothing instead.

We're migrating internally from cron jobs to systemd units, and this behavior makes it difficult to disable jobs during state application, while also letting us spot-check empty `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

    # crontab -l
    no crontab for root
    # salt-call cron.rm_job root foobar
    local:
        absent
    # crontab -l
