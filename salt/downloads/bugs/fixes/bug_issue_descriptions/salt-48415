### Description of Issue/Question
In a multi-master setup `event.send` appears to just go through the list of masters, open a channel and fire an event to that master's bus. This continues to work when one of these masters is down, logging `[DEBUG   ] SaltReqTimeoutError, retrying. (1/7)`. However, in the case where any one of these masters has not yet accepted the minion key, this process will die at whatever master has not accepted the key instead of continuing through the list of masters. 

The event appears on all the masters prior to the failure, but the overall command back from the CLI fails.

I've attached the output of my trace log from the CLI for reference. The first log will show that the second master is not attempted to be connected to. The second log shows that the command failed at the second master but sent the event to the first one.

[salt-call_trace_eventsend_master2_fail.log](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/files/2156868/salt-call_trace_eventsend_master2_fail.log)

My testing was primarily done in 2017.7.5, but I have also verified this is 2017.7.6.

### Setup
I'm using three Docker containers, one minion and two masters. I've installed the code with the bootstrap script on each container.

#### Minion Config
```
master:
  -  172.17.0.2
  -  172.17.0.4
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
* Connect minion to two masters
* Accept key on one of the masters
* Leave the key in unaccepted state on the other master
* From the minion run, `salt-call -ltrace event.send 'myco/mytag/someminion/testing4' "{'mydata':'this is neat'}" `
