I'm using a combination of file and gitfs backends, with a subdirectory of a Git repo overlaid within a file-based state directory (as described in the gitfs [tutorial](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/gitfs.html), using "root" and "mountpoint" options). In the SLS file, I have a `file.recurse` state, using the gitfs mountpoint as the source, but this causes an error "none of the specified sources were found".

Yet, when looking at the debug output, I see:

```
[DEBUG   ] Fetching from file:///var/gnat.git
[DEBUG   ] Gitfs received 0 objects for remote file:///var/gnat.git
[TRACE   ] Returning file_lists cache data from /var/cache/salt/minion/file_lists/roots/base.p

[TRACE   ] Returning file_lists cache data from /var/cache/salt/minion/file_lists/gitfs/base.p
[ERROR   ] Recurse failed: none of the specified sources were found
```

even though I see in "/var/cache/salt/minion/file_lists/gitfs/base.p" the files with the correct prefix, i.e., under the specified mountpoint.
