### Description of Issue
After upgrading to 3000.0.0rc2 I noticed `pip.installed` was not working.

Getting a minimal sls and running in debug mode gave the following error:
```
[DEBUG   ] Failed to import states pip_state:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1607, in _load_module
    mod = imp.load_module(mod_namespace, fn_, fpath, desc)
  File "/opt/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/pip_state.py", line 129, in <module>
    from pip.exceptions import InstallationError  # pylint: disable=E0611,E0401
ImportError: No module named exceptions
```

### Setup
```
progressbar:
  pip.installed
```

Should trigger it, I am running python2.8

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running the simple sls from under the setup section triggers the error for me.
