i just merged salt/develop in our fork
and runners seems not working anymore

2 bugs i have:
- print() are going to /dev/null and no more on console
- 50% of the time a simple runner does not return at all
  Llast thing i have is 

```
[TRACE   ] get_event() received = {'tag': 'salt/run/20150113211529561598/new', 'data': {'fun': 'runner.mc_api.ping', 'jid': '20150113211529561598', 'user': 'UNKNOWN', '_stamp': '2015-01-13T21:15:30.572539'}}
```

the runner function is as simple as:

```
def ping(): 
     print 'foo' 
```
