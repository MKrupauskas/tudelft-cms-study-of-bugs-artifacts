I found what I think is an inconsistency in behavior. Using a listen_in requisite on a file.directory (with clear: True) does not show that the listener will fire when run with test=true and files would be removed from the directory. When run for real, the listener does in fact fire correctly. Other states appear to flag the listener even in test mode.

An example state exhibiting this behavior is as follows.

```jinja
{% for version, config in php.items() %}
php_{{ version }}_service:
  service.running:
    - name: {{ config.packages.fpm }}
    - enable: True

php_fpm_{{ version }}_pool_clear:
  file.directory:
    - name: {{ config.files.fpm_d }}
    - mode: 755
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - clean: True
    - listen_in:
      - service: php_{{ version }}_service
{% endfor %}
```

If you run with test=true, the output looks something like the following. Note that there is no "listener" state at the end of the run, even though the file.directory state shows changes.

```shell
[relidy@minion]$ sudo salt-call state.apply fpm test=true
local:
----------
          ID: php_v7_0_service
    Function: service.running
        Name: php70-php-fpm
      Result: True

```

Running the same command, but with test=false (or omitted entirely) actually does the correct thing (just not what the test run reported). Note in this case that there **is** a listener state now.

```shell
[relidy@minion]$ sudo salt-call state.apply fpm test=false
local:
----------
          ID: php_v7_0_service
    Function: service.running
        Name: php70-php-fpm
