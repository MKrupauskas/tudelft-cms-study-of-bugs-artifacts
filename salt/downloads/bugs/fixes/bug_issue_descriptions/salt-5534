I just switched the rev on my git.latest state to a new branch. When running highstate, git.latest fails because it says it can't find the pathspec.

```
  File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/state.py", line 1210, in call
ret = self.states[cdata['full']](*cdata['args'])
File "/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/states/git.py", line 70, in latest
__salt__['git.checkout'](target, rev, force=force)
File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/git.py", line 351, in checkout
return _git_run(cmd, cwd=cwd, runas=user)
File "/usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/salt/modules/git.py", line 75, in _git_run
raise exceptions.CommandExecutionError(result['stderr'])
CommandExecutionError: error: pathspec 'staging' did not match any file(s) known to git.
```

Shouldn't it be fetching remote before checking if the pathspec exists?

I've tried adding the always_fetch option and it does not appear to change the behavior.  I am also using the --force-checkout option, fwiw.
