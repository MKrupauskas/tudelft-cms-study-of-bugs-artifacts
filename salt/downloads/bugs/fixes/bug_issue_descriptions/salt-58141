### Description of Issue
Salt-minion creates thread leak if PTR record is malformed.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1.Crete malformed PTR record for any IP on the salt-minion  for example "." ( this was a case with my provider ).
2. Apply highstate form the master, I have single file.touch in my highstate.
`/tmp/salt.touch:
    file.touch`
3. Execute "systemctl status salt-minion"

In my case I have:
```

The workaround was to update /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/modules/network.py.
However, I am not a dev and have limited knowledge in python, so the proper fix would be much appreciated as we are relying very heavily on saltstack.

```  results = []
    try:
        pool = ThreadPool(8)
        results = pool.map(_lookup_fqdn, addresses)
        pool.close()
        pool.join()
    except Exception as exc:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
        log.error("Exception while creating a ThreadPool for resolving FQDNs: %s", exc)
        pool.close()

    for item in results:
        if item:
            fqdns.update(item)

    elapsed = time.time() - start
    log.debug("Elapsed time getting FQDNs: {} seconds".format(elapsed))

    return {"fqdns": sorted(list(fqdns))} ```
