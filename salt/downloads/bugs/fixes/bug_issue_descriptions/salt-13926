We have a state to configure each minion as we want it to be that is fired off via a reactor when a new minion's key is accepted. One of the most important things it does is ensures the salt-minion config is happy and everything is started.

We saw issues where it wouldn't detect that the system was running systemd for some odd reason and had to statically set it such as:

``` yaml
salt-minion:
  service:
    - running
    - enable: True
{%- if grains['os'] == 'RedHat'
    and grains['osrelease'] >= '7.0' %}
    - provider:
      - service: systemd
{%- endif %}
```

Can this be fixed?
