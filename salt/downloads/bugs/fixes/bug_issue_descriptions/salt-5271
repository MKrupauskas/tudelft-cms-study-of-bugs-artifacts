I am experiencing some issues with salt-minion (0.14.1) under RHEL6 + EPEL6. The installed dependencies are the standard ones from EPEL (python-zmq 2.2.0.1, python-crypto 2.0.1, python 2.6.6). When I start the salt-minion it always tracebacks:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/salt-minion", line 14, in <module>
    salt_minion()

zmq.core.error.ZMQError: Invalid argument
Exception AttributeError: "'SREQ' object has no attribute 'poller'" in <bound method SREQ.__del__ of <salt.payload.SREQ object at 0x1ed4e10>> ignored

What could be causing this?
