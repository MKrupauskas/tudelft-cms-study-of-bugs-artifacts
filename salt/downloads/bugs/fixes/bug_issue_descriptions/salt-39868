### Description of Issue/Question
Not sure if I'm not using archive.extracted properly or if this is a bug, I think that it should check for the tarball content besides the hashes are not changed and extract if files are missing.

### Setup
```sls
perlbrew:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /
    - source: http://perl.company.com/perlbrew.tar.gz
    - source_hash: http://perl.company.com/sha256sum.txt
    - source_hash_update: True
    - overwrite: True
```

### Output
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run the above state, then remove the extracted tarball path and run the state again. Salt will compare hashes and not extract as stated in documentation:

> Salt now uses a function called archive.list to get a list of files/directories in the archive. Using this information, the state can now check the minion to see if any paths are missing, and know whether or not the archive needs to be extracted. This makes the if_missing argument unnecessary in most use cases.
