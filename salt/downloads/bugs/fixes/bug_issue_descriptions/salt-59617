**Description**
Hello, I have an issue w/ Salt napalm proxy issue. Connection to local minion which is on the same machine is working fine, proxy is running also on the same machine.

I am getting the following error when running this test command sudo salt '*' test.version

ubuntu:
    3002.2
sw:
    Minion did not return. [Not connected]
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code

sw is the napalm proxy

I am also getting this error in /var/log/salt/proxy:
2021-02-25 06:36:53,423 [salt.cli.daemons                                           :537 ][ERROR   ][5154] Proxymodule napalm is missing an init() or a shutdown() or both. Check your proxymodule.  Salt-proxy aborted.


And this one when trying to test connection to the device via napalm .......napalm --vendor ios --user matej --password klklkl 192.168.1.92

Traceback (most recent call last):

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

I suppose more likely issue w/ napalm than w/ Salt itself.
Any ides what could be wrong? I have installed napalm according to this link https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html also with the dependecies for ios.

Thanks
