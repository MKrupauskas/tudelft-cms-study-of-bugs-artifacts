### Description of Issue/Question

I have been trying to get `docker-py` in order to use `dockerng` modules and states, but I have run into many issues. This is a summary of what I have found.
### Setup
1. Salt 2015.8.10, 2016.3.0, 2016.3.1
2. Ubuntu 14.04
3. Docker-py 1.7.2/1.8.1
4. Docker 1.11.2
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The salt minion requires `docker-py` python module in order to manage docker containers. This should be as simple as running:

```
python-pip:
  pkg.installed: []

docker-py: 
  pip.installed:    
    - name: docker-py>=1.4.0 # installs 1.8.1 by default
    - reload_modules: True
    - require:
      - pkg: python-pip
```

This works on CentOS 7 and Debian Jessie without problem. On Ubuntu 14.04, the state is successful, but once I go to spin up a container with `dockerng`, I get module import errors. 

Based on suggetion here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/28036 and https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/26115#issuecomment-143920045

I have created a workaround for Ubuntu 14.04 like so:

```
python-pip:
  pkg.purged: []

python-setuptools:
  pkg.installed: []
  - require:
    - pkg: python-pip

pip-install:
  cmd.run:
    - name: easy_install pip
    - require:
      - pkg: python-setuptools

docker-py:
  cmd.run:
    - name: pip install docker-py==1.7.2
    - reload_modules: True
    - require:
      - cmd: pip-install
```

It is also worth noting that docker-py **1.8.1 does not work on** Ubuntu 14.04 using my workaround:

Using 1.8.1:

```
----------
          ID: registry
    Function: dockerng.running
      Result: False
     Comment: State 'dockerng.running' was not found in SLS 'docker.registry'
              Reason: 'dockerng' __virtual__ returned False: 'dockerng' __virtual__ returned False: Docker module could not get imported
