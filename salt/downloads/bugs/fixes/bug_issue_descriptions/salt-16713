Hi All,

As suggested by @cachedout, hereby my utf8 encode error during a custom deb package install. It's a reproducible error.
# The full error and stacktrace:

```
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

I'm running salt 2014.7.0rc3 (Helium)
# Problem origin and solution

It seems it has todo with the output of a package being installed with `dpkg`. It asks about some settings in color.
- Package in question: ossec-hids-agent - 2.8.1-ubuntu3
- Taken from: https://launchpad.net/~nicolas-zin/+archive/ubuntu/ossec-ubuntu/+packages
- placed/installed straight from salt

```
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive dpkg -i /tmp/ossec-hids-agent_2.8.1-ubuntu3_amd64.deb
```

Suppressing with the `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` doesn't help. It breaks (i think) because it needs the parameters defined upfront. This can be done with:

```
echo 'ossec-hids-agent  ossec-hids-agent/serverip   string  127.0.0.1' | debconf-set-selections
```

Workflow wise setting the presets makes it workable, however, I think de Salt guru's :wink:  would like to capture the utf8 error.

The actual full error in the minion log is several screens long and contains sensitive data. It can be provided on request.

Questions welcome.

Kind regards,

Gerard.
