When a file is new, it receives 0644. When that file is later updated, it changes to  0600.

When file.managed creates a new file and **no mode is specified**, that file gets the default permission (usually 644). Later, when that file content is updated and the machine is highstated, the permissions change to 600. I believe the change originated in #8818 because salt 0.17.2 works and salt 0.17.4 doesn't.
