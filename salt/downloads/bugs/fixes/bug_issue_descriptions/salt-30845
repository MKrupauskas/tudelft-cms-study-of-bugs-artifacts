Not sure if this is more of a Salt issue or a Elastic/Beats issue, but I had to pick someplace to start. I'm trying to set up Elastic's [topbeat](https://github.com/elastic/beats) log aggregation program, but seem to have a problem starting it using Salt's `service` module and/or state. When I do `salt-call --local service.start topbeat`, salt-call never returns. Or if I run it on the master, the salt command never returns. I've tested this on both CentOS 6.7 and Ubuntu 14.04 with Salt 2015.8.4.

The only output is:
`[INFO    ] Executing command '/sbin/service topbeat start' in directory '/root'`

If I just run the command outside of Salt, it starts right up just fine. For reference, here's the init script (template) for all the "beats" programs: https://github.com/elastic/beats/blob/master/dev-tools/packer/platforms/centos/init.j2

Any thoughts on why Salt seems to get stuck starting this service? Or if this seems more likely to be a problem with the "beats"s' scripts themselves?
