Hi,
I have a problem with the 2014.7.1 version and svn.latest/svn.export states using options like username, etc.

state:

failed-svn:
  svn.export:
    - name: url
    - username: XXX
    - password: YYY

```
 Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1529, in call
              **cdata['kwargs'])
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/states/svn.py", line 233, in export
              out = __salt__[svn_cmd](cwd, name, basename, user, username, password, rev, *opts)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/svn.py", line 482, in export
              return _run_svn('export', cwd, user, username, password, opts)
            File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/svn.py", line 62, in _run_svn
              opts.extend(['--username', username])
          AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'extend'
```

It looks as somebody has changed the option parameter handling in the modules file. Now a list is expected, however a tuple is passed in. Does anybody know if there was a recent change?

Should I provide a fix for that?
