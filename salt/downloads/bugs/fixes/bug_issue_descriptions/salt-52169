### Description of Issue/Question

The module `salt_proxy.configure_proxy` uses the hard coded path `/etc/salt/proxy`. This fails on any non-linux system such as *BSD. It would be better if the module would honor the paths defined in `salt.syspaths`, and in the long run a configurable configuration file path with reasonable defaults would be optimal.

### Setup

```yaml
proxy-xyz:
  salt_proxy.configure_proxy:
    - proxyname: xyz
    - start: True
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Use the provided state on any non-Linux OS
- The reported error:

```
                  Salt Proxy: Error writing proxy file [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/salt/proxy'
                  Salt Proxy: Error writing proxy file [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/salt/proxy'
```
