If you have a syntax error in your roster file for salt-ssh, such as a missing space after `host` such as `host:111.222.333.444` instead of `host: 111.222.333.444`, you get the following error:

```
# salt-ssh nt-cent6 test.ping
No hosts found with target nt-cent6 of type glob
```

YAML is probably treating the whole string as a key, so it's `host:111.222.333.444: None` or something like that.

There should be a check for host since it's a required member of the roster dictionary, and then provide a more helpful message if host isn't there, or you've mistyped something like this.
