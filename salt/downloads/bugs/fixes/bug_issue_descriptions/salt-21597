When trying to provision an instance using the joyent driver, the following stacktrace occurs:

```
[DEBUG   ] Attempting connection to host 72.2.119.233 on port 22
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: an integer is required

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 224, in meth
    return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)

```

I had this working a couple of days ago and I have not changed the provider or profile configurations. I am running on the HEAD of 2015.2:

```

```

The VM I requested to be provisioned exists on the joyent interface, and I can delete it, but the salt-cloud command itself stops at the above stacktrace.

This is very likely related, if not the same issue as, #21596. The stacktraces look very similar.
