In this changeset fcbed9a, quoting was added to package names with the "!r" format flag. Packages are then appended to the pip command as strings enclosed in single quotes:

" 'packagename' "

On linux, this works fine. On Windows, the Package resource API (lib/site-packages/pkg_resources.py) cannot properly parse package names quoted like this, hence raising this "Missing distribution spec" error.

I am not sure what would be the right way to fix this. Using the "!s" flag instead of the "!r" flag would fix this, but could potentially break something else. I am not fully aware of the all the pip module subtleties, so I cannot for sure propose a solution.
