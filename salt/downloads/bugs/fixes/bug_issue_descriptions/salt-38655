### Description of Issue/Question
I have added the following to /etc/salt/master config file,
```
engines:
  - thorium: {}
```
/srv/thorium/top.sls file contains the following,
```
base:
  '*':
    - key_clean
```
/srv/salt/key_clean.sls contains the following,
```
startreg:
  status.reg

keydel:
  key.timeout:
    - reject: 60
    - require:
      - status: statreg
```
Also a beacon with the following content has been added to minion at /etc/minion.d/beacons.conf
```
beacons:
  status:
    interval: 10
```
I am able to see status events at every 10 seconds.

I still dont see the key of the minon getting rejected after specified interval.
Am i missing some configuration?
Please help
