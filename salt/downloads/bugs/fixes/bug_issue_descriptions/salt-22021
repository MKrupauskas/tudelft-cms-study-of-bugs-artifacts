This might be considered a non-issue, but on bare-bone installations of Debian 8 (Jessie), sudo is not installed by default, so cmd.run/wait commands fail when a user context is applied.

Example State Command definition:

```
/binpath/tools-extraction.sh:
  file:
    - managed
    - mode: 755
    - template: jinja
    - user: {{user}}
    - group: {{user}}
    - source: salt://tools/tools-extraction.sh
    - require:
      - file: /binpath
```

State output error:

```

The issue simply stems from Salt attempting to change the user with the `sudo -u username`  instead of `su - username`. (I tested with `su` manually and it worked fine)  

Installing `sudo` with apt fixes the problem and Salt executes the script fine, however it seems odd that it doesn't have a fall back to `su` if `sudo` is not installed by default.  I have to salt master configured to run commands as `root`, so I think Salt is just using `sudo` instead of `su` to switch user contexts for command execution.  `sudo` is not installed even with standard system utilities selected during boot, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect Salt to handle this.

Debian 7 with 'standard system utilities' selected also does not install `sudo` by default.  So I guess our cloud images have just installed it for us.  

This isn't a new [problem](http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?p=528259) in the Debian world, but it seemed like worth mentioning.  

Test Environment:
`salt 2014.7.1 (Helium)` Master & Minion

Minion OS: Debian 8 Jessie RC1  
- `Linux debian 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt7-1 (2015-03-01) x86_64 GNU/Linux`  

Master OS: Ubuntu 14.04
- `Linux opstop 3.13.0-36-generic #63-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 3 21:30:07 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

I'm guessing this might be known behavior, but I wasn't able to find a WNF issue already, and freenode#salt said I should open a ticket.
