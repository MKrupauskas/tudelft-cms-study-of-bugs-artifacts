**Description**
CIS standards require noexec on /tmp partition. Once this is implemented scripts run from salt master are broken due to the noexec.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
1. Mount /tmp  with these options per CIS standard: defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime
2.  Try to execute script through salt master

**Expected behavior**
Script should execute
