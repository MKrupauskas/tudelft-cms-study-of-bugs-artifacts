### Description of Issue/Question
Salt crashes with a nice python trace after upgrading urllib3 from 1.21.1 to 1.22.
```
root@hostname:~ # service salt_minion start
Starting salt_minion.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/salt-minion", line 6, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

    raise DistributionNotFound(req, requirers)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'urllib3<1.22,>=1.21.1' distribution was not found and is required by requests
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/salt_minion: WARNING: failed to start salt_minion

```
### Setup
FreeBSD 11 with py27-salt and urllib3 installed:
```
root@hostname:~ # pkg search py27-salt
py27-salt-2016.11.6_1          Distributed remote execution and configuration management system

root@hostname:~ # pkg search urllib3
py27-urllib3-1.22              HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling, file post, and more
py36-urllib3-1.22              HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling, file post, and more
```

Note: Using py27-salt from the official FreeBSD repository versus using py27-salt from the saltstack repository does not make a difference.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set up a fresh FreeBSD 11 and install py27-salt.
