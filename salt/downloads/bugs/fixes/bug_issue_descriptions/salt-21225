I'm using the SVN backend for my states and recently started using the SVN ext_pillar. However, when I try to run a state that uses Pillar data across my 50 nodes, it usually fails with "Salt request timed out. If this error persists, worker_threads may need to be increased". The master log shows that the master is trying to update the same working copy over and over and getting:

I gradually increased the worker_threads and found that the state.sls timeouts went away once worker_threads >= minions. But the "working copy locked" errors continue (and having a worker thread for each minion doesn't scale).
