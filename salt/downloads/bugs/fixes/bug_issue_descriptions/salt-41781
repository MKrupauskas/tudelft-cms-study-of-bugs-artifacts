### Description of Issue/Question

It's impossible to run a docker container with `network_mode: host` now that hostname is propagated automatically.

### Setup
```
mycontainer:
  docker_container.running:
    - network_mode: host
    ...
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

It's not possible to force unset `hostname`, and it makes no sense to unset `name` (not possible either, though): [dockermod.py:L2484](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/dockermod.py#L2484). Salt shouldn't second-guess and apply defaults where none needed and there's no way to revert them.
