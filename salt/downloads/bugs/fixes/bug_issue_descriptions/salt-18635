If I don't give a provider name, only an instance, this function works fine
    `instance_info = cloud_client.action(fun='show_instance', names=['test_123'])`

But If I try it with a provider name, it flips out about wrong number of arguements
    `instance_info = cloud_client.action(fun='show_instance', provider='vsphere', names=['test_123'])`

Is this caused by the way the action is written in the clouds/vsphere.py https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/vsphere.py#L538? Is it because it lacks a kwargs argument? I'm just taking a stab in the dark, was debugging around https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/__init__.py#L449 until I hit the provider-less magical incantation.
