Working with Salt with a syndic the notification that a minion did not return was missing from the job cache in the master of masters, while the same job run from the syndic directly would show up in the job cache on the syndic.

Doing some testing on 2015.8.3 (the versions report is below) I didn't see the missing minion info in either of the job caches. It would be good to make sure that info shows up in the job cache and not just on the cli.
