Hi,

I've built a current Salt 2014.7.2 from ports on a FreeBSD 10 VM and configured rc.conf to enable the minion. However, "service salt_minion start" prints "Starting salt_minion", but doesn't return and the minion process hogs the CPU at ~99%. I need to explicitely kill the process from another terminal to get the prompt back (CTRL-C doesn't work).

If I run it from the shell, I get this output:

``` bash
# salt-minion -l debug
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /usr/local/etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Using cached minion ID from /usr/local/etc/salt/minion_id: host.domain
[DEBUG   ] Configuration file path: /usr/local/etc/salt/minion
```

where it hangs forever and brings the CPU to 99% again.

Bye...

Dirk
