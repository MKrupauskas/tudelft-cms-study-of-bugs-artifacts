I have a state that adds Googles chrome repo:

```
google-chrome-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - name: deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main
    - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list
    - key_url: https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub
```

It used to work, but in 0.17.5 it gives this error:
Failed to configure repo 'deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main': Error: key retrieval failed: apt-key add /var/cache/salt/minion/extrn_files/base/dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub

If I wget the file and use a salt:// url instead, in works. I have also tried the equivalent http:// url, which also fails.

I am on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit. I have been unable to find earlier versions of salt in the PPA, so I can't test which version update broke it, but it used to work for me.
