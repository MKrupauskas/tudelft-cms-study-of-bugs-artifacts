1) If a virtual machine image doesn't have salt-minion already, `salt/modules/seed.py:_install` tries to fetch the value of `salt.syspaths.BOOTSTRAP`, but `salt.syspaths.BOOTSTRAP` doesn't exist by default.

`sys/syspaths.py` tries to populate its module scope by importing `sys/_syspaths.py`, but BOOTSTRAP is not defined in `sys/_syspaths.py`. BOOTSTRAP is defined only if `sys/_syspaths.py` doesn't exist.

2) Also, look at `salt/modules/seed.py:apply_`, if bootstrap is needed, `seed.apply` doesn't seem to copy minion config and key to a virtual machine. It is a failure of virt.init to not copy minion config and key if the virtual machine doesn't have salt-minion already.
