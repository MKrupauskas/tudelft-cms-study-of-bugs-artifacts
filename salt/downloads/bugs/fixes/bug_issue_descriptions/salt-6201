master config:

/srv/pillar/
 schedule.sls
 top.sls

top.sls:
base:
  '*':
    - schedule

schedule.sls:
schedule:
  highstate:
    function: state.highstate
    minutes: 1


minion config:

/etc/salt/minion
pillar_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/pillar

master cli:
salt  "*" pillar.data

return:
    schedule:
        ----------
        highstate:
            ----------
            function:
                state.highstate
            minutes:
                1
```

But it did not work...

Manually execute the command:
salt  "*" state.highstate
The changed files can be synchronized .but schedule does not work
What went wrong?
Thanks!
