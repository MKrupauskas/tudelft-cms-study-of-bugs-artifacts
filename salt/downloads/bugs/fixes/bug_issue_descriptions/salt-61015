**Description**
We are trying to execute a bash script which includes "curl <api>| jq -r .response" from salt state file.

The job is failing with error
              stderr:
                  parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 10

The above bash script is working if runs directly in the server but failed while calling through _cmd.run_

However the same state file is working in one other server with expected result. I couldn't figure out the exact issue

Checked Jq version, its working in jq-1.5 some servers and not in others.

Can anyone please help?

**Setup**
extract_value:
  cmd.run:
    - names:
      - echo "executing script"
      -  nohup ./extract_value.sh

In sh file we have,
response=$(curl -s -X GET -k --cert <cert> --cert-type p12 https://"$INSTANCE_NAME":"$PORT"/<value>/version | jq -r '.responseBody.triggerRequired, .responseBody.FileName, .responseBody.Number')
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant)

**Expected behavior**
It should return the output response
