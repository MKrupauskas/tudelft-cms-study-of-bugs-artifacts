The documentation states that "The verify_ssl parameter defaults to True" but that is not the case.

I switched to using S3 as backend but something was missing. This was the relevant bit of my master conf:

```
ext_pillar:
  - s3:
      bucket: bucketname
      keyid: <redacted>
      key: <redacted>
```

```

Master log file:

## Fix

All was well as soon as I added `verify_ssl: True` to s3 ext_pillar configuration
