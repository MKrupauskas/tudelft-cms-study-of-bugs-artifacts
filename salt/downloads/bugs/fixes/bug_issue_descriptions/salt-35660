### Description of Issue/Question

The `_uptime()` function in the `status.py` execution module has been removed for Carbon, as it is deprecated. However, the new `uptime()` function doesn't currently work with Solaris-like systems. 

This issue is to track updating the `uptime()` functions, as requested by @sjorge. See the discussion in PR #35535 for more details.
