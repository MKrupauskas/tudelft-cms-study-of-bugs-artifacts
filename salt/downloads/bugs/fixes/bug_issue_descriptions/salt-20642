Hi.

After a time modification on salt-minion, communication between salt-master and salt-minion is lost.
I use following packages:

```
salt-minion-2014.7.0
salt-master-2014.7.0
python-raet-0.3.8
```

I tried to synchronize time on a minion using following sls file:

```
sync-time:
  cmd.run:
    - name: ntpdate -u time.nist.gov
```

I've run following command on salt master:

```
#salt 'ctrl-3' state.sls test-time
```

Time on minion was updated (`ntpdate[2758]: step time server 128.138.141.172 offset -7182.702919 sec'`) but the master hasn't showed any response from salt-minion.

Then i tried on master test.ping, but this command didn't returned any response:

```
#salt 'ctrl-3' test.ping
```

I had to restart salt-minion and then communication between minion and master was ok.

Following commands was executed on salt-minion while communication between master and minion was interrupted:

```
netstat -ulpn
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

```

```
strace -p 2680
