### Description of Issue

We rely on zmq_filtering, which enables [publisher side filtering](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/transports/zeromq.html).

We intend to upgrade our salt-minions to a recent version. Therefore we tested “Can the master contact the minion with zmq_filtering?”:

"minion_start delay" means the time between starting the salt-minion service and the minion_start event showing up in the event bus (of an salt-master having only one minion).

We used two servers:
 - WSL = Windows Server for Linux Debian.
 - CentOS7


 Minion-version                            | Does `test.ping` work in both directions? (master-version: minion_start delay)
 -------------------------------------|--------------------------------
 3001 Py3 | Yes (2019.2.5 Py2 CentOS8)
 v3000.1-344-Py3-64 | Yes (WSL2: 5s)
 3000.1-Py3-64 | Yes (3000.2Py3 CentOS7: 60; 2018.3.4 Py2 CentOS7: NO; WSL2: 5s )
 2019.2.3-Py3-D64 | Yes (WSL: 5s)
 2018.3 (Git head 1255) Py3 64   |   Yes (2018.3.4 Py2 CentOS: 6m)
 2018.3.4-Py3-D64  |   No   
 2018.3.4-Py2-64 | Yes (2018.3.4 Py2 CentOS: 6m)
 2018.3.3-Py2-64 | Yes (2018.3.4 Py2 CentOS: 6m)
 2017.7.8-Py3-32  | No (Exception below)
 2016.11.10-32  | Yes (no delay)
 2016.11.3-64 |  Yes  (no delay)


### Setup

To enable/disable publisher side filtering we used the following 6 steps:
1. Stop salt-master service
2. Stop salt-minion service
3. Add/remove the setting “zmq_filtering: True” on the master
4. Add/remove the setting “zmq_filtering: True” on the minion
5. Start salt-master service
6. Start salt-minion service


We used the following two commands to test “can the server contact the minion?”:
1. salt minion1 test.version
2. salt-run manage.status

Success of "salt-run manage.status" is given when the minion status is “up”.


## Notes

All above minions can contact the master without zmq_filtering.

All above minions can contact the master with zmq_filtering, except 2017.7.8-Py3-x86 (see below).

We noted that after disabling publisher side filtering, it took several minutes before the master could contact the minion. 


### Salt-Minion-2017.7.8-Py3-x86-Setup.exe

Salt-Minion-2017.7.8-Py3-x86-Setup.exe and “publisher side filtering” and “\salt\salt-call -l debug test.version” resulted in an Exception. Reproduced in a second installation.


```

TypeError: unicode not allowed, use setsockopt_string

```

#### Second note on Salt-Minion-2017.7.8-Py3-x86-Setup.exe

About 30 minutes after the TypeError, a python.exe process with an empty command line (command line is an optional column of Windows Task-Manager/Processes) uses 28% CPU, resulting in 50% overall CPU consumption and a fan running at maximum. 
	

### Versions Report
