### Description of Issue/Question
When issuing pkg.upgrade on any openSUSE or Enterprise Server, certain packages cause false reports of upgrading packages although nothing is actually installed. Such packages are always multiversion files such as kernel, crash-kmp and gpg-pubkey packages which many may be installed at the same time as well as custom packages that may have multiple versions such as nVidia or driver rpms.

Example:

```
zabbix:~ # salt '<sles12sp3host>' pkg.upgrade
sles12sp3host:
    ----------
    crash-kmp-default:
        ----------
        new:
            7.1.8_k4.4.92_6.30-4.6.2
        old:
            7.1.8_k4.4.131_94.29-4.8.1,7.1.8_k4.4.92_6.30-4.6.2
    gpg-pubkey:
        ----------
        new:
            edf0d733-54930778
        old:
            39db7c82-5847eb1f,50a3dd1c-50f35137,bf9a56ad-5758109f,e4e37c43-584f065d,e9e45fb5-57d42e04,edf0d733-54930778
    kernel-default:
        ----------
        new:
            4.4.138-94.39.1
        old:
            4.4.120-94.17.1,4.4.126-94.22.1,4.4.131-94.29.1,4.4.132-94.33.1,4.4.138-94.39.1
```

No new packages were installed, only reported as being "new" despite having already been installed on a previous run.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
No special configuration is required - even out of the box configuration produces the same issue.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Simply running salt 'host' pkg.upgrade reproduces the issue on all distribution versions that we currently use (SLE12SP3, SLE15)

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
