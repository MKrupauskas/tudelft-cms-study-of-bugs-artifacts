### Description of Issue/Question

When deploying ubuntu 16.04 VMs with salt-cloud it fails with error:

```
W: The repository 'https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/16.04/amd64/latest trusty Release' does not have a Release file.
E: Failed to fetch https://repo.saltstack.com/apt/ubuntu/16.04/amd64/latest/dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found
E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
 * ERROR: Failed to run install_ubuntu_stable_deps()!!!
```
### Setup

Fresh setup, created fresh provider:

```
do:
  driver: digital_ocean
  personal_access_token: ...
  ssh_key_file: "/srv/salt-cloud-ssh-key/salt"
  ssh_key_names: SALT
  location: New York 3
```

And a profile:

```
do_ubuntu_1604_1gb:
  provider: do
  size: 1gb
  image: ubuntu-16-04-x64
  location: nyc3
  private_networking: True
```

salt-cloud -p do_ubuntu_1604_1gb test1 gives error mentioned above.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I suppose freshly installed salt-cloud will fail to deploy on Ubuntu 16.05 because it incorrectly sets up Salt's repository (as seen from error).
