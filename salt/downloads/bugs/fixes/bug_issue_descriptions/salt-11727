I got this error on one of my minion and I would like to fix that but I don't know what is the problematic pillar. The minion is now stuck in a kind of corrupted state. Grains are still working.

I got the exact same roles, pillars and grains on an other gameserver and the error don't happen on it. I'm on version 0.16.4 for the minion and master. At the same time, is it possible to include the erroneous pillar name in the log.

I tried (on the minion and on the master) :

```
salt-call saltutil.sync_all
salt-call state.clear_cache
salt-call saltutil.refresh_pillar
service salt-minion restart
```

Error output:

```
# salt-call pillar.items
