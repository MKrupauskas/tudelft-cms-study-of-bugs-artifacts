The changes introduced in #16127 have caused some breakage with gitfs and syndics. Syndic failures are related to the tests on 2014.7 where syndic tests are failing with stacktraces. Here's an example of the failures: https://jenkins.saltstack.com/view/2014.7%20Branch/job/salt-2014.7-rs-arch/318/

Then, when executing a `state.sls` command on an sls from gitfs, I get a similar stacktrace to the syndic test stacktraces:

```
