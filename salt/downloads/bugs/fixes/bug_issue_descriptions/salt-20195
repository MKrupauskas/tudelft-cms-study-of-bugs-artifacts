This patch seems to introduce a behavior change: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/8a674cf7958434c295edd87d3e5af95cfecba0d5

Previously, you had to specify "xz" in the tar options to extract a compressed tar file.  Now you must specify only "z", or else you get "xxz" which doesn't work (for me!)
