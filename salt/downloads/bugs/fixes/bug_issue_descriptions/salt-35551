### Description of Issue/Question

The rsync.synchronized state doesn't work on 2016.3.2 (and previous as well 2016.3.X)

```
[vagrant@saltmaster master]$ sudo salt 'mono' state.apply test
mono:
  Name: rsync - Function: pkg.installed - Result: Clean
----------
          ID: rsync_from_master
    Function: rsync.synchronized
        Name: /tmp/test2
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

### Setup

Simple test.sls

```
rsync:
  pkg.installed

rsync_from_master:
  rsync.synchronized:
    - name: '/tmp/test2'
    - source: '/tmp/test1'
    - delete: false
    - update: true
    - prepare: true
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create /tmp/test1 folder
Launch a salt '*' state.apply test

well in fact I think it comes from the rsync module that now uses cmd.run instead of run_all, the rsync state is then getting back a string instead of a dictionnary and is not so happy with it
as a workaround I m going to use the module directly.... which... was not a good idea because it doesn't return an error if rsync fails... going for the cmd.run instead
