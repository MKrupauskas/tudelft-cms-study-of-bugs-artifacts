Basically I would like to combine two file.recurse so that result has contents of both states merged together, but this does not work. It works as expected for require_in and file.managed.

``` salt
/etc/fwgen/rules:
  file.recurse:
    #    - name: /etc/fwgen/rules
    - clean: True
    - source: salt://baseconfig/files/fwgen_rules/default
    - template: jinja

rules_{{ grains['fqdn'] }}:
  file.recurse:
    - name: /etc/fwgen/rules
    - source:
      - salt://baseconfig/files/fwgen_rules/{{ grains['fqdn'] }}
      - salt://baseconfig/files/fwgen_rules/empty
    - template: jinja
    - require_in:
      - file: /etc/fwgen/rules
```

``` yaml
