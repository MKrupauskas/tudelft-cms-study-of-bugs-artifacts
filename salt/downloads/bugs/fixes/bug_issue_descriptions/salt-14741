Running salt 2014.1.7

The way the code is written it copies the runas value into user but it never uses the user parameter that i can see. It does set the old 'runas' parameter to None in any case. So by the time the command is going to push out, it tests "if runas:" (which is always set to None) so then it jumps down to run this

```
ret['comment'] = __salt__['cmd.run']('{0}'.format(cmd))
```

and command in every scenario is set to

```
cmd = '{0} "{1}" | {2} {3}'.format(echo_cmd, job, binary, timespec)
```

which doesnt seem to include a user option in the command
