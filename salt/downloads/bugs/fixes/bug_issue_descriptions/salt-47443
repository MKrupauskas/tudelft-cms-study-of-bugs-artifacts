### Description of Issue/Question

Browsing the tool LGTM, I saw several errors that are initialized but not raised for input validation in win_dsc.py: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/saltstack/salt/snapshot/cea932162130f65040b889fc4e2f0f3bae98c27d/files/salt/modules/win_dsc.py?sort=name&dir=ASC&mode=heatmap&showExcluded=false#L722

Looking at `SaltInvocationError` and its base class, there doesn't seem to be any magic happening on initialization that would cause the error to be automatically raised. My conclusion is that this is likely a mistake and the input validation routines are most likely not doing anything.

The impact of this is that the powershell command that this code generates could be malformed or have invalid values.

I considered potential security ramifications, but I think there are not any because this would just allow powershell cmd injection on servers where you can already run modules with salt. Please let me know if I have overlooked any security concerns around this.
