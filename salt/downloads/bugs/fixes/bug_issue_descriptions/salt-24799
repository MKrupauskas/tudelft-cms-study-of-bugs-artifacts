If I use mount.mounted and in opts I have backup-volfile-servers=10.0.1.2:10.0.1.3 for example - mount is forced to remount each time, when actually nothing changes.
If I add beckup-volfile-servers in mount_invisible_options = [ @ salt/states/mount.py it works as expected.

The backup-volfile-servers option is used with glusterfs.
