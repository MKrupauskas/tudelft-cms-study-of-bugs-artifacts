### Description of Issue/Question
win_system.get_pending_domain_join is returning False even though PC was just joined to an AD domain
### Setup
Here is a state file which renames and joins then attempts a reboot.
```
name computer:
    system.computer_name:
       - name: OUREXAMS2100008

{% set user_name = pillar['user_name'] %}
{% set p_word = pillar['p_word'] %}
join domain:   
    system.join_domain:
       - name: AD.QUEENSU.CA
       - username: {{user_name}}
       - password: {{p_word}}
       - account_exists: True
       - restart: False
       - require:
            - name computer
       
reboot computer:
     system.reboot:
        - timeout: 0
        - only_on_pending_reboot: True
        - order: last
        - require:
              - join domain
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
We can run the above state file with:
```
salt -t 120 '210008' state.apply our_join pillar='{"user_name": "garf", "p_word": "asdfasdfasdf"}'
```

We will then get the following output:
```
210008:
----------
          ID: name computer
    Function: system.computer_name
        Name: OUREXAMS210008
      Result: True
     Comment: Computer name successfully set to 'OUREXAMS210008' (reboot required for change to take effect)
     Started: 15:32:08.356468
    Duration: 31.577 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              new:
                  OUREXAMS210008
              old:
                  somehtingorother
----------
          ID: join domain
    Function: system.join_domain
        Name: AD.QUEENSU.CA
      Result: True
     Comment: Computer added to 'AD.QUEENSU.CA'
     Started: 15:32:08.403369
    Duration: 3955.51 ms
     Changes:   
----------
          ID: shutdown computer
    Function: system.reboot
      Result: True
     Comment: System reboot has been skipped because no reboot was pending
     Started: 15:32:12.358879
    Duration: 15.3 ms
     Changes:  
```

(Note that the changes dictionary in the "join domain" state is empty, which is a separate issue that also needs fixing)


The final reboot fails because it also turns out that when we run the following command:
```
salt -t 120 '210008' system.get_pending_domain_join
```

we then get the following output
```
210008:
    False
```
The result of the command is surely wrong.
