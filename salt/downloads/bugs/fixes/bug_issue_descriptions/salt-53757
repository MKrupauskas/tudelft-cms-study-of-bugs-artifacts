I am using a simple salt state to send (file.managed) and execute (cmd.run) a shell script on a minion/target. No matter what exit or return value the shell script sends, the salt master is interpreting the result as successful.

I tried using cmd.script, but keep getting a permission denied error on the temp version of the file under /tmp. Filesystem is not mounted with noexec so we can't figure out why it won't work. I saw earlier references to a bug for this but was supposedly fixed in 2012. 

For cmd.run, stdout in the job output shows the failed return code and message but Salt still says Success. Running the script locally on the minion reports the return/exit code as expected.

I tried adding stateful: True into the cmd.run block and formatted the key value pairs at the end of the shell script as demonstrated in the docs.

Running against 2 minion target, 1 fail 1 succeed. Both report Result as True but correctly populate Comment with my key value pair.

I've tried YES/NO, TRUE/FALSE, 0/1 - nothing works.

The end of my shell script, formatted as shown in the docs.

    echo Return_Code=${STATUS}

    if [[ ${STATUS} -ne 0 ]]
       then
          echo ""
          echo "changed=False comment='Failed'"
       else
          echo ""
          echo "changed=True comment='Success'"
    fi

The SLS block:

    stop_oracle:
      cmd.run:
        - name: {{scriptDir}}/{{scriptName}}{{scriptArg}}
        - stateful: True
        - failhard: True
