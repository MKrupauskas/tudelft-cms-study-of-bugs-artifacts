When running lowpkg.info against a CentOS 6.7 minion I get the following error:

```
$ salt '*' lowpkg.info salt-minion
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1036, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/rpm.py", line 470, in info
        value = _pkg_time_to_iso(value)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/modules/rpm.py", line 409, in _pkg_time_to_iso
        ptime = time.strptime(pkg_time, '%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %p %Z')
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/_strptime.py", line 454, in _strptime_time
        return _strptime(data_string, format)[0]
      File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/_strptime.py", line 328, in _strptime
        data_string[found.end():])
    ValueError: unconverted data remains:       Build Host: localhost
```

I discovered this is because the rpm command being executed produced the following ouput:

```
$ rpm -qi salt-minion

Description :
The Salt minion is the agent component of Salt. It listens for instructions
from the master, runs jobs, and returns results back to the master.
```

Note that there is multiple 'keys' per line (for example: 'Name' and 'Relocations' appear on the first line) but the code is expecting one per line. As a result when it attempts to parse the date on the 'Install Date' line it is picking up the 'Build Host' key as well. This results in the `ValueError: unconverted data remains:       Build Host: localhost` error.

I downloaded the source for RPM and found that the '-i' option is a macro for the '--qf' option with a predefined format. There is also a comment stating that this is not necessarily consistent. It would therefore appear that relying on the '-i' option could result in undefined behaviour (where the resultant '--qf' is not as expected) and that a safer approach would be to use a hard-coded value for '--qf'.
