### Description of Issue/Question

salt.state.archive.extracted passes a computed filename to file.managed which may not match the name of the file actually downloaded. When using a source_hash url pointing at a file with multiple hashes in it, the correct file won't be found.

For example, given the following

```
gradle-pkg:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /opt/
    - source: http://skaterat.net/software-cache/gradle-2.10-bin.zip
    - source_hash: http://skaterat.net/software-cache/SHA256SUM
    - archive_format: zip
    - if_missing: /opt/gradle-2.10/
```

with SHA256SUM containing (amongst other things):

```
VALIDHOSHCODE HERE  *gradle-2.10-bin.zip
```

salt/archive.py is passing "_opt_gradle-2.10_.zip" as the name argument to file.managed (by mangling the if_missing element).  This in turn causes file.managed to download the source (gradle-2.10-bin.zip) properly but search the source_hash file for "_opt_gradle-2.10_zip".  which in turn causes the checksum to fail since _opt_gradle-2.10_zip is not present

Might be able to change _filename_ (file.managed first param) to _source_match_ or just _source_ to resolve in the following archive.py code:

```
        log.debug('%s is not in cache, downloading it', source_match)
        file_result = __salt__['state.single']('file.managed',
                                               filename,
                                               source=source,
                                               source_hash=source_hash,
                                               makedirs=True,
                                               saltenv=__env__)
        log.debug('file.managed: {0}'.format(file_result))
```

Several workarounds:
1. list the hash directly via `source_hash: sha256=yada-yada
2. use the source_hash url points at a single file feature - for example:ing at a single file  such as http://skaterat.net/software/gradle-2.10-bin.zip.SHA256
3. use a file.managed rule to mange the zip locally, have the archive.extracted rule require the local zip file.
### Setup

SHA256SUM.salt looks like:

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

add the sample rule to your env and run it.  It won't pass.
