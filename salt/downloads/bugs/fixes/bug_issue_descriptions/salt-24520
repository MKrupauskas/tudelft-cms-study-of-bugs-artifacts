When running a tomcat.war_deployed state, in 2015.5 it now always redeploys the module:

``` yaml
          ID: /test
    Function: tomcat.war_deployed
        Name: /test
      Result: True
     Comment: {'fullname': 'test##None', 'version': 'None', 'mode': 'running', 'sessions': '0'}
     Started: 15:52:03.168657
    Duration: 9829.36 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              deploy:
                  deployed /test in version test-1.0.2-20150609.052602-3
              undeploy:
                  undeployed /test in version None
```

Note that the version is detected in the changes comment, but when deployed the version is appears as "None". The "None" version also appears in tomcat.ls.

I suspect the breaking change was in commit c6c0dd511bbf71b2b4e937bd63e577c31c61afc1 where the version# detection changed from simply being the filename (minus .war) to:

``` python
    version_extract = re.findall("\d+.\d+.\d+?",os.path.basename(war).replace('.war', ''))
    if len(version_extract) == 1:
        version_string = version_extract[0]
    else:
        version_string = None
```

Which breaks on snapshot releases that include timestamps/build numbers/etc in them in addition to the version# itself.

I suspect extracting using a more generic regex of something like: "-([\d.-]+)$" would solve this, but I'm not quite sure if this is necessarily the best approach either or if it would regress PR #16832 which introduced this regression while fixing something else.

I'm not quite sure what PR #16832 fixed as I was personally deploying from a https url without issues so the non-salt:// files is a little incorrect anyway. Perhaps @syphernl can chime in to confirm exactly what broke in his setup previously and confirm that we won't inadvertently break him in fixing this.
