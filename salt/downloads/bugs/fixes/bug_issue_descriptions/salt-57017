**Description**
Per your release notes there is a typo, where _minion_runner should be minion_runner in 2019.2.4. This bug makes our systems unusable due to a reliance on minion_runner. I'm confused by the release notes and why this is not being patched as part of a patch for a CVSS 10 bugfix. I can't apply this patch to our systems without manually modifying /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/salt/master.py to the correct value.

My issue here is that I can't ignore a CVSS 10 and would prefer not to hack in untested code on production servers.

Is there any clear guidelines on how we should implement this so that minion_runner is functional? Or is there any clear target date of when this will be patched and available?

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Install 2019.2.4.

**Expected behavior**
minion_runner should be the correct value in expose_methods var.
