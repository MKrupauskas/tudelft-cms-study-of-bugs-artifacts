We've recently identified an issue with pkg.latest, that it fails to update packages in ubuntu intermittently.

I've been doing some digging and it turns out that with apt_pkg, `version_compare` returns integer values (per [this document](https://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/library/apt_pkg.html)), while `salt.utils.compare_versions` only accept -1, 0 and 1.

Take our case today as an example, a package that's been updated from 1.2-12-gf27225d to 1.2-18-g45016fd. `apt_pkg.version_compare` returns -6 with these two versions, indicating an update is in order. However, `salt.utils.compare_versions` doesn't believe -6 is a proper code for operation `<` and thus returns False.

BTW the code level we've been using is

```
