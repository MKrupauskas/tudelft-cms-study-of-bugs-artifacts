Let's say for some reason /var/cache/salt/master/tokens/ has been wiped or lost (runs in tmpfs for example), it would be nice for salt to be more explicit on the errors it displays (indicating it's grabbing a token from ~/.salt_token for example, or offering to remove that token which no longer works). 

By the way, reading the code in salt/master.py it feels like it is in need of some refactoring, 

```
# rgrep "Authentication failure of type \"token\" occurred" master.py | wc -l
12
```

Are these the same as in daemons/masterapi.py ?

```
# rgrep "Authentication failure of type \"token\" occurred" daemons/masterapi.py  | wc -l
12
```
