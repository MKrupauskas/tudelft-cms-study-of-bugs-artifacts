Hi -

I'm trying to use the new master_type: func feature in 2014.7.0 but it doesn't seem to be working.

I created a simple execution module which returns a master hostname:

[vagrant@salt-master1 ~]$ sudo salt salt-minion1.local salt.master
salt-minion1.local:
    salt-syndic1.local

I then added this to the minion config for salt-minion1:

master: salt.master
master_type: func

After restarting the minion it throws this error:

2014-09-12_00:32:24.32736 [ERROR   ] This master address: 'salt.master' was previously resolvable but now fails to resolve! The previously resolved ip addr will continue to be used
2014-09-12_00:32:24.32780 [WARNING ] Master hostname: salt.master not found. Retrying in 30 seconds

The documentation on using master_type: func was pretty light. I am specifying the function the correct way?
