### Description of Issue/Question
It seems like sal-virt is ignoring the **enable_vnc=True** option when creating a new VM. 

For example, trying:
salt-run -l debug virt.init centosTEST37 4 2048 salt://centos6-base.img seed=False enable_vnc=true

returns no error, but the resulting XML does NOT contain a vnc graphics or serial adapter, which makes the VM unable to boot.

### Setup
Salt master with 2 minions, one of those minions is the master itself. Both minions are kvm hypervisors with 128GB ram each.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Have a VM image ready and put it on salt://centos6-base.img
2. salt-run -l debug virt.init centosTESTvm 4 2048 salt://centos6-base.img seed=False enable_vnc=true
3. Check the resulting VM by looking at either the xml with virsh edit centosTEST or virt-manager, you will notice there is no vnc graphics adapter.

**Something that I found while troubleshooting this:**
If I edit templates/virt/libvirt_domain.jinja and remove the conditionals (if statements) surrounding the vnc and the serial console parts, the vnc graphics adapter WORKS when the VM is deployed, that points at: a) some error with the conditionals or b) some error in modules/virt.py when setting those variables. My guess its "b" but haven't found any so far so the error may lie somewhere else
