As described in #2428 - template rendering (or maybe transfer) ends with uncaught exception for UTF-8 string in template. It's "feature" of msgpack and kind of a won't fix issue. What can be fixed though is the hard fail. 

The exception should be handled and salt should display human-readable error message instead, saying that it's known issue and solution is to remove diacritics from the file. Ideally it should display the incriminate part of the file if possible - I had invisible UTF-8 whitespace inside otherwise ascii file and it was hard to debug.
