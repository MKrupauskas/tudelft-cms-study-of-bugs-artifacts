I've been plagued with connection issues recently. I've had to restart the salt minions _and_ master nearly constantly, and now I am actually unable to get anything connected again. On the plus side, failing all the time means that I have deterministic ways to reproduce the bugs!

First up:
1) start salt master
2) start salt minion

Receive this in the master log:

```
[INFO    ] Clear payload received with command _auth
[DEBUG   ] This salt-master instance has accepted 16 minion keys.
Process MWorker-5:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    return bool(clean_path(opts['pki_dir'], id_))

  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 53, in isabs
    return s.startswith('/')
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'
```

3) stop salt minion
4) start salt-minion

Minion is now stuck at "waiting for minion key to be accepted"
Master shows no entries in log

I'm not sure if this exception is related to the connection issues, but it seemed like they might be related.
