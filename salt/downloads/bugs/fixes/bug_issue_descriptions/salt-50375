### Description of Issue/Question
I'm looking for a way to programmatically check if pillars are able to render and\or up to date.

As I understand so far `saltutil.refresh_pillar` call is asynchronous and can't be used for this at all. I looked into the synchronous refresh_pillar PR(https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/50168) and looks like it won't help either. 

I wish there is a `pillar.get` an argument which will force to return an error is the key can't be looked up. Right now it always returns 0 even if there is no key and only in master logs I can find the root of the problem - error in pillar rendering.

```
[behavox@test-run-kproskurin-rm stack]$ salt 'test-run-kproskurin-rm' pillar.get common
test-run-kproskurin-rm:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1607, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/pillar.py", line 188, in get
        raise KeyError('Pillar key not found: {0}'.format(key))
    KeyError: u'Pillar key not found: common'
