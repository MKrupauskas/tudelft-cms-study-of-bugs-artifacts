Salt versions: 0.16.3 and b2465eb40577e5ead4ef26c7efbdab83476d728e

I was attempting to test preseeding minion keys on salty-vagrant. As far as I can tell, the script is seeding everything correctly but my salt-master is rejecting the public key.

To reproduce: create a key pair. Install salt via bootstrap script, passing the "-k /dir-with-keys" and "-M" to install salt master.

Wait for minion and master to install and startup. Observe that the minion's public key is in /etc/salt/pki/master/minions/minion_id and also in /etc/salt/pki/minion/minion.pub as it should be.

Perform a diff on the two pub key files and they are identical. List the accepted keys, and you will see minion_id. However, looking in master or minion logs will show that the minion's key was rejected. Restarting the master or minion does not fix the problem.

Deleting the key and reaccepting it does work, however.
