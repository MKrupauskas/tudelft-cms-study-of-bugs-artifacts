### Description of Issue/Question

Log further says: "It should either return `True`, `False` or a new name. If you're the developer of the module 'mac_system', please fix this."

### Setup

#### minion
    id: localhost
    file_client: local
    root_dir: .
    file_roots:
      base:
        - salt
#### salt/example.sls
    test:
      pkg.installed:
        - name: grep
#### salt/top.sls
    base:
      '*':
        - example

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run as a non-root user:
    # salt-call --local -c . state.apply test=True -l debug

The `ERROR` lines are noise when `state.apply` seems to work fine otherwise. Looks like this module is only for running `shutdown`, which my system doesn't allow for a non-root user anyway.
