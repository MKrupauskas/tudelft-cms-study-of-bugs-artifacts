I tried to install jenkins via local rpm, but not work.

```
jenkins-pkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - jenkins: salt://jenkins/bin/jenkins-1.490-1.1.noarch.rpm


----------
    State: - pkg
    Name:      jenkins-pkgs
    Function:  installed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   The following packages failed to install/update: jenkins.
        Changes:

is it a bug or ?
