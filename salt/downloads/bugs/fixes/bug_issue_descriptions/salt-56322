### Description of Issue
While using the LocalClient with cmd_batch() I was wondering why I got no client returner output. It looks like there is a small issue in /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/batch.py in the class Batch, function run().
The function Batch.run() reads the returner option like this:
<code>
ret=self.opts.get('return', '')</code>  ( line 241 )
This works fine as long as you use the cli salt/salt-call command in batch mode but not if you use LocalClient.cmd_batch() since this is using 'ret' for an optional argument.
If I change the code in batch.py by changing <code>ret=self.opts.get('return', '')</code> to <code>ret=self.opts.get('ret', '')</code>, the LocalClient.cmd_batch() call works fine but the cli stops working by not using the returner. This behaviour is noticed in all versions of salt from 2018.3 or even earlier.
I am not sure if this is the way it is supposed to work, can you please advise?



### Setup
Take an arbitrary returner e.g. /srv/salt/_returners/test.py:
<pre><code>
def returner(ret) :
    try :
        with open('/tmp/test.log','w') as fh :
            fh.write('Returner started...\n{0}'.format(str(ret)))
    except :
        pass
</code></pre>

Take a small python script using the LocalClient() /root/bin/test_batch.py:
<pre><code>
import salt.client
local = salt.client.LocalClient()
local.cmd_batch('*','test.ping',ret='test',batch='10%')
</code></pre>

Compare the results by running CLI in batch mode and the small script. Change the 'return' into 'ret' in the code and run again.
