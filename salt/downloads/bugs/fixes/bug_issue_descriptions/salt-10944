This was a tricky one to find!

So here's what we start with. When installing a package with either `repo`, `fromrepo`, `enablerepo`, or `disablerepo` in your pkg.installed state, the repo options are not passed to _repoquery in yumpkg. This doesnt happen on pkg.install because pkg.install does not make a call to _preflight_check the way pkg.installed does*.

So the offending lines are [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L396):

``` python
        lines = _repoquery(
            '--pkgnarrow=all --all', query_format='%{NAME}_|-%{ARCH}'
        )
```

You'll notice that we don't pass rep_arg to the query. This causes things like `enablerepo = True` to fail on all pkg.installed states. 
- I'm not sure if this is another bug that should be addressed or if this is by design.
