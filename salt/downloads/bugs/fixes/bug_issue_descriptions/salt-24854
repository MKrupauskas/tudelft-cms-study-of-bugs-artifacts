Since the previous #14763 has been closed for some time now, I will open a new issue.
### The problem:

I create a new external grain, called (fancy, I know) `mooh` under `/srv/salt/_grains/mooh.py`. I then run `salt '*' saltutils.sync_all` and `salt '*' grains.item mooh` to see that it's really there on the minions.

Then I try to target the minions using `salt -G 'mooh:1' cmd.run uptime` and it fails until after I restart the minions.
### Output

```
root@host2 # salt 'host1' grains.item mooh
host1:
    ----------
    mooh:
        1
root@host2 # salt -G 'mooh:1' cmd.run uptime
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

Running a minion restart makes the grain available:

```
root@host2 # salt 'host1' cmd.run 'service salt-minion restart'
host1:
    salt-minion stop/waiting
    salt-minion start/running, process 11805
root@host2 # salt -G 'mooh:1' cmd.run uptime
host1:
     10:45:44 up 3 days, 14:36,  2 users,  load average: 0.13, 0.09, 0.06
```

The grain itself is extremely simple:

``` python
#!py
def mooh():
        grains = {}
        grains['mooh'] = 1
        return grains
```
### Renaming the returned grain

I have also tested in changing the grain name (using `grains['booh']` instead of `grains['mooh']` - the filename and the function name remain unchanged) and the behaviour is (almost) the same. 

```
root@host2 # salt -G 'booh:1' cmd.run uptime
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
```

But, when trying to target the old grain again:

```
root@host2 # salt -G 'mooh:1' cmd.run uptime
host1:
    Minion did not return. [No response]
root@host2 # salt '*' cmd.run uptime
host1:
     11:07:10 up 3 days, 14:57,  2 users,  load average: 0.27, 0.16, 0.09
```

Salt version:

```
root@host2 # salt '*' --versions-report
                  Salt: 2015.5.0
                Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
