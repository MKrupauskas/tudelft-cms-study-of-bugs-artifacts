### Description of Issue/Question

The ssh_auth state module adds a newline before every new key it adds to the authorized_keys file.

Problem is a wrong seek() call in ssh.set_auth_key(), modules/ssh.py line 706 (676 in develop branch).  If I change _fh.seek(1024, 2) to _fh.seek(-1, 2), the issue goes away.  But that can't be the real fix as it breaks (invalid argument exception) if for whatever reason, authorized_keys is zero bytes long.
### Setup

Anything along the lines of:

```
test:
  ssh_auth.present:
    - user: test
    - names:
      - BOGUSKEY
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Create a state like above and apply, making sure the key is not present before.
