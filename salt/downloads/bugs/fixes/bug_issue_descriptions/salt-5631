Assume we installed salt like normal, and we have a barebones /etc/salt/master. If I then set my SALT_\* environment variables to override that and attempt to start the master it will continue to use the default location. I have to physical [re]move the default configuration before the environment variables are recognized -- or I can override the config directory with the -c flag.

I've seen this with salt-master and salt-cloud.
