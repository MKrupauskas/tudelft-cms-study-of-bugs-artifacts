### Description of Issue/Question

`archive.extracted`, when given a `user` or `group`, changes ownership on every file under `name`, rather than just those provided by the archive.

This means that extracting archives into "busy" places like `/etc` or OSX's `/Applications` while supplying a `user`/`group` can have disastrous effects.

Possible solutions:
- Only chown from `if_missing` and below, if that parameter is passed
- Parse tar's output (`tar tfz file.tar.gz`) to see what files it has extracted, and chown them (being careful to chown symlinks rather than their targets, etc.)
### Setup

``` yaml
my_app:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: /Applications
    - if_missing: /Applications/MyApp.app
    - source: salt://apps/MyApp.tar.gz
    - archive_format: tar
    - user: root
    - group: wheel
    - tar_options: z
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run the above state on a mac. Make sure you don't mind your permisssions on `/Applications` getting overwritten... Provide any tar.gz file under `salt://apps/MyApp.tar.gz`, in the end it doesn't matter what it contains.
It will probably work on other Linux/Unix systems too, you just need to edit the paths.
