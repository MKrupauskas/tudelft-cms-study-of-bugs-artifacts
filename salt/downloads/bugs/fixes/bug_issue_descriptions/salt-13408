Per issue #8418, Salt was misreporting the line number of jinja renderer errors.  This was supposedly fixed with pull #8475 in 2014.1.0.  However, I just encountered the same error in 2014.1.4, indicating that the underlying issue is not, in fact, fixed.  Is this something wrong with jinja?

Error example.  As you can see, jinja is reporting an error with the variable hr_db, but pointing to a line containing a different variable (a line which is about 30 lines away from the actual source of the bug).
