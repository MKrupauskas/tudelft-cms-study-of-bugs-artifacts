the first time I run 

```
  salt controller state.highstate
(
Keystone tenants:
  keystone.tenant_present:
    - names:
      - admin
      - demo
      - service
    - connection_token : ADMIN
    - require:
      - ini: /etc/keystone/keystone.conf
)
```

there is some errors like this :

```

but the second time I run it, there is no error...

```
----------
          ID: Keystone tenants
    Function: keystone.tenant_present
        Name: demo
      Result: True
     Comment: Tenant "demo" has been added
     Changes:
              ----------
              Tenant:
                  Created
----------
```

that makes me very confused
