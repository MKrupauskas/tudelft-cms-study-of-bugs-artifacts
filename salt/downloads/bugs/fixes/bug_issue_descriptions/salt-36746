### Description of Issue/Question

When hitting Ctrl + C during the middle of a job the output is missing information about the jid and job. 
### Setup

1.master and minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Run a job and select Ctrl + C before the job ends.

```
[root@a52e6f412c65 testing]# salt '*' test.sleep 30
^C
Exiting gracefully on Ctrl-c
```

Previously in 2016.3.3 the output looks like so:

```
[root@a52e6f412c65 testing]# salt '*' test.sleep 30
^C^CExiting on Ctrl-C
This job's jid is:
20160930224600683947
The minions may not have all finished running and any remaining minions will return upon completion. To look up the return data for this job later run:
salt-run jobs.lookup_jid 20160930224600683947
```
