### Description of Issue/Question

With my `master_job_cache` configured to use a custom returner, all the returner functionality seems to work, but the `manage` runner always reports all minions as down, even when they are known to be up.

### Setup

I have one master configured with my returner, and one minion (`minion1`) connected to it.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

`salt minion1 test.ping` returns `True` for `minion1`.
`salt manage.status tgt='minion1'` times out and reports `minion1` as down.

Watching the event bus shows that the `test.ping` job started by the manage runner is running and `minion1` is returning.

```javascript
salt/job/20171204113250371849/new       {
    "_stamp": "2017-12-04T18:32:50.377095",
    "arg": [],
    "fun": "test.ping",
    "jid": "20171204113250371849",
    "minions": [
        "minion1"
    ],
    "tgt": "minion1",
    "tgt_type": "glob",
    "user": "root"
}
salt/job/20171204113250371849/ret/minion1       {
    "_stamp": "2017-12-04T18:32:50.460292",
    "cmd": "_return",
    "fun": "test.ping",
    "fun_args": [],
    "id": "minion1",
    "jid": "20171204113250371849",
    "retcode": 0,
    "return": true,
    "success": true
}
```

Could this be a race condition in the manage runner? The runner runs a `test.ping` job and then starts an event listener (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/runners/manage.py#L40-L69) to collect returns. If `LocalClient.run_job()` takes a while to return, is it possible that the `ret` event is arriving before the event listener is started?
