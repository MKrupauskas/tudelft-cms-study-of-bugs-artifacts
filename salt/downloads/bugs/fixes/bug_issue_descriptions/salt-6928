It seems my salt master is stating every single file in my files root even when nothing is referencing them. It does this for every highstate and every also for sync_all. It also follows symlinks, going into recursive hell. I can't run a highstate on more than a few nodes at a time without consuming all CPU on the master and even simple calls take 10-15 minutes.
