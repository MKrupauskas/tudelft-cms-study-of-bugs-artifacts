### Description of Issue/Question
A command like `salt MINION service.restart salt-minion` works fine on Linux, Windows, and even Solaris. But on MacOS, it just kills the service. There's no apparent workaround either, because any process (including a local script that would start the service) started by the minion dies with the main process when it restarts, killing any would-be restart commands anywhere.

Also, I can't use `at` because every attempt for any command in the `at` module just results in a dump and a `list index out of range` error from the minion.
