### Description of Issue/Question
Currently the netbox execution module bundles token authentication together with the private key file needed for working with the `secrets` app.  If you set up the NetBox application to require login by default, the `netbox.filter` and `netbox.get` functions will return a 403 because unless you're working with the `secrets` endpoint, the token doesn't get passed to the api.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set `LOGIN_REQUIRED = True` in your netbox `configuration.py` and attempt to use `netbox.filter` or `netbox.get` and you'll receive a 403 trace even if you specify your token in the minion configuration file.
