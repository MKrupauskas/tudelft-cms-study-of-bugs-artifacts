### Description of Issue/Question

When running `salt-key -A -y` or `salt-key -a minion -y` I see the following output:

(carbon)

```
[root@localhost ~]# salt-key -A -y
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
10.0.2.15
Accepted Keys:
10.0.2.15
```

Where as before it looked like the following (2016.3.3):

```
[ch3ll@thecakeisalie Documents]$ sudo salt-key -A -y
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
thecakeisalie
Key for minion thecakeisalie accepted.
```

I would not expect to see the Accepted Keys in the output also its missing `Key for minion thecakeisalie accepted`. 

Also the `salt-key -D -y` output is different as follows:

(carbon)

```
[root@localhost ~]# salt-key -D -y
The following keys are going to be deleteed:
Accepted Keys:
10.0.2.15
```

(2016.3.3)

```
[ch3ll@thecakeisalie Documents]$ sudo salt-key -D -y
Deleting the following keys:
Accepted Keys:
thecakeisalie
Key for minion thecakeisalie deleted.
```

In this case it is missing the `key for minio...`

The same goes for when you running both `salt-key -a <mnion>` and `salt-key -d <minion>` it does not display `key for minion <minino> deleted` after hitting y.
### Setup

Master with a minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. `salt-key -A -y`
2. `salt-key -D -y`
