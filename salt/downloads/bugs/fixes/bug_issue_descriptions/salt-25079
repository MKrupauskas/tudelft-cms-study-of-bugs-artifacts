When making a new minion with salt-cloud, if you have more than one ssh key with the same name with a provider (such as digital ocean) there is no warning issued. This can lead to 'Permission Denied" issues when trying to deploy a minion. Would be useful for salt to check for duplicate names and show a warning.
