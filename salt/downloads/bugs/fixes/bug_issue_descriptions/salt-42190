### Description of Issue/Question

As mentioned https://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html#salt.states.file.line file.line takes the 'content' parameter.

```
isotope.pkgsrc.sandbox::hook:
  file.line:
    - name: /data/pkgbuild/scripts/run-sandbox
    - mode: ensure
    - before: "/usr/sbin/chroot ${chrootdir} /bin/bash --login"
    - content: "/data/keys/setup-env ${chrootdir}"
```

Now generates a warning:
```
    2017-07-07 01:02:15,901 [salt.loaded.int.states.file                                            ][WARNING ][25062] State for file: /data/pkgbuild/scripts/run-sandbox - Neither 'source' nor 'contents' nor 'contents_pillar' nor 'contents_grains' was defined, yet 'replace' was set to 'True'. As there is no source to replace the file with, 'replace' has been set to 'False' to avoid reading the file unnecessarily.
```

It as the file was already in the good state, I am not 100% the state still works.
