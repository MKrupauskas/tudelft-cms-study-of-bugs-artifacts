Having looked at the source it appears that someone thinks that modifying /etc/shadow directly is "more secure" than using e.g. usermod or chpasswd.  If there is a valid reason to think that (encrypted memory space vs exposing the hash in the process list for a split second during execution?) it would be nice if you took the time to modify the password last changed field at the same time.

Not getting the password ageing information updated is a security flaw in its own right.
