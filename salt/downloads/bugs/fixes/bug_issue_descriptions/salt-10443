Hello, 

Problem : 
     Jobs call with cmd_async let millions of files in directory /var/cache/salt/master/jobs/
     Files seems to be never deleted. Even if I set a strict settings 'keep_jobs: 1'
     Problem is more about number of files(inodes) than disk space for me.

I have a syndic with about 200 minions.  
I see the number of files growth with X*Y  where X:number of minions  in this syndic Y: jobs launched

Versions (minion, syndic, master) are: 
           Salt: 0.17.5
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Dec 26 2010, 22:31:48)
         Jinja2: 2.5.5
       M2Crypto: 0.20.1
 msgpack-python: 0.1.10
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.1.0
         PyYAML: 3.09
          PyZMQ: 13.1.0
            ZMQ: 3.2.3

Not very familar with erlang, only solution I found to avoid problem is to manually erase file jobs.
Tell me if anything else is welcome.

Lucas
