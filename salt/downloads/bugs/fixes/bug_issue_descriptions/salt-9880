Executing the state below on a Windows minion where the D: drive doesn't exist makes the minion process hang. The memory consumed by the process rises indefinitely and the process never returns. It should instead return an error saying this drive doesn't exist. Observed on 0.17.2.

```
my_file:
    file.managed:
        - name: D:/MyFolder/my_file.txt
```
