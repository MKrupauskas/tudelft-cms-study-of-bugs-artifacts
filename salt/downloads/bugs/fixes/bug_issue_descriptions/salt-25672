Note: This is a follow-on to #25455

Repro steps:
1) Setup gitfs using pygit2
2) Add this repo that contains a 100MB file to the gitfs config: 
https://github.com/edubart/testrepo
3) copy file out of formula to minion:
salt 'minion-name' cp.get_url salt://largefile /tmp/largefile
4) watch the target directory. You should notice the file size increasing about 1MB/minute

I'm probably getting too fancy with expecting large files to smoothly make the transition through gitfs in this way - and I'm aware of the large file/binary file limitations of git; however, adding setup code (large RPMs to a formula could be a nice way of encapsulating what certain formulas need to accomplish (I'm looking at you oracle sql client RPM!).

Perhaps this is an issue with pygit2/libgit rather than salt - but the large file issue was supposed to be fixed in a much older libgit. Ref: https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues/1081
