When `unicode_literals` was imported from `__futures__` in `utils/aws.py`, it caused the s3 module to break.

### Setup
None

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Command to run:  `salt '*' s3.get`

Leads to the following stacktrace:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/adam/IdeaProjects/salt-stack/salt/minion.py", line 1622, in _thread_return
    return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
  File "/home/adam/IdeaProjects/salt-stack/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
