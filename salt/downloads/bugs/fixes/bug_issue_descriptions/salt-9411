The comment in the `except` block, here https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/crypt.py#L18 indicates that crypt is not needed in local mode, but there are other reasons that the import might fail.

RHEL seems to have a library linking problem, and complains with this:

```
ImportError: /usr/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/M2Crypto/__m2crypto.so: undefined symbol: PEM_write_bio_SSL_SESSION
```

This makes the code try to do `RSA.gen_key(â€¦)` on a failed `import` and missing `RSA`.

Seems guarding needs to be improved here.
