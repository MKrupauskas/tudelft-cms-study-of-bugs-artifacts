I have a service.status check running via the scheduler with a mysql returner. I have tried to tie this into the reactor, but I don't see any events from the scheduled jobs. I've tried using the `eventlisten.py` and running the master in debug mode. The only way I've been able to trigger the event is manually using `salt-call`.

Is it possible to see events for scheduled jobs?

Please let me know what more information I can provide. (2014.7.0, FreeBSD)
