Given that a user is installing a package with the fromrepo param, if that repository is by default disabled, then the refreshdb function in: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/yumpkg.py#L612 doesn't take into account the desired fromrepo.

From yum manual:

```
    The  following are the ways which you can invoke yum in clean mode. Note
    that "all files" in the commands below means "all files in currently
    enabled repositories".  If you want to also clean any (temporarily)
    disabled repositories you need to use --enablerepo=’*’ option.
```

This means we end up with yum -q clean expire-cache instead of yum -q clean expire-cache --enablerepo=custom-feature-repo
