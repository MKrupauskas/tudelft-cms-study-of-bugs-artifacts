I've made a port of salt for OpenBSD, where we don't have any PAM support nor plan to have one.

salt works fine, but the master barfs a little bit at startup complaining about PAM, since ctypes tries to use it : 

```
[WARNING ] Failed to import auth pam, this is due most likely to a syntax error. Traceback raised:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 600, in gen_functions
    ), fn_, path, desc
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/auth/pam.py", line 92, in <module>
    PAM_START = LIBPAM.pam_start
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 378, in __getattr__
    func = self.__getitem__(name)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/ctypes/__init__.py", line 383, in __getitem__
    func = self._FuncPtr((name_or_ordinal, self))
AttributeError: Unable to resolve symbol
```

It would be nice to detect that PAM is not available (maybe testing for LIBPAM value ?) to avoid having such scary warnings. Especially since salt/modules/pam.py checks for libpam.so too..
