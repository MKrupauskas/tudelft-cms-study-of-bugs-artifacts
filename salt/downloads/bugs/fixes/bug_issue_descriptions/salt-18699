This condition is used in several places:

``` py
if bool([True for i in _keywords if i in stdout.readline().rstrip()]):
```

It seems logically equivalent to:

``` py
first = stdout.readline()
second = stdout.readline()
if 'successful' in first or 'successfully' in second:
```

Which seems a bit odd. Is that really the intended logic?
