I'm not sure if this is a bug or a documentation issue.

I was experimenting with only using git for my pillar data, so I had set pillar_roots to be empty since I had no file roots for pillar:

```
pillar_roots: {}
```

This resulted in an exception in git_pillar, [here](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/pillar/git_pillar.py#L152) because there was no 'base' key in pillar roots.

Changing my pillar roots got past it:

```
pillar_roots:
  base: {}
```

but from the documentation I had concluded that pillar_roots was only needed for defining file roots for pillar data.
