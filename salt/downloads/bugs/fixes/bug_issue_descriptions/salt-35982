I have a fully working salt virt environment, only virt.migrate fails.
All servers are running stock Debian Jessie 8.5 on stable repo.

When running:

`salt-run virt.migrate test22`

the command fails with:

```
[DEBUG   ] Runner return: Exception occurred in runner virt.migrate: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/client/mixins.py", line 342, in low
    data['return'] = self.functions[fun](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/runners/virt.py", line 530, in migrate
    origin_host = list(origin_data.keys())[0]
KeyError: 0
```
- however a `salt kvmhost1 virt.migrate test22 kvmhost2` works fine
- All other aspects of salt virt seems to work.
### Setup

kvm hosts setup as described in: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/cloud_controller.html
