The salt module `disk.fstype` uses the `df -T` command to check the filesystem type on volumes. Unfortunately df only lists filesystems that are mounted, `file -s` should be used to test block devices for their file types.

### Setup
Attach a volume to a machine and format it as ext4 without mounting it, try to use disk.fstype on it. It will report the type as `devtmpfs`. Now mount it and try again, it will report the type as ext4.
