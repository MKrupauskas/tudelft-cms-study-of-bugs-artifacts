When using two onlyif statements, they are ORed rather than ANDed.

```
my_state:
  cmd.run:
    - name: rm -rf important_folder
  onlyif:
    - condition1
    - condition2
```
I would expect both conditions to be true before the state runs. In this case, only one is enough to trigger the state.

Either this should be fixed, or the documentation updated to make clear what happens in this case. Since unless and onlyif accept a list of commands, the behaviour should be well defined and documented.
