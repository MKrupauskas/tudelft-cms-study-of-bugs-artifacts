I am using version 2014.1 and can't seem to get parenthesis to work for compound matching:

``` bash
$ salt -C '(another-machine or machine-*) and S@192.168.0.0/16' test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
$ salt -C 'machine-* and S@192.168.0.0/16' test.ping
machine-1:
    True
machine-0:
    True
machine-2:
    True
```

. I'm expecting the first one to work since parenthesis are mentioned in #5314. Seems like it works without parenthesis, however I'm a bit unsure about the operator presedence:

``` bash
$ salt -C 'another-machine or machine-* and S@10.11.0.0/16' test.ping
machine-1:
    True
machine-2:
    True
machine-0:
    True
another-machine:
    True
```
