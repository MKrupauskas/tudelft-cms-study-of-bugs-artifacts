I have a state such as:

```
squeeze-backports:                                                                                                            
    pkgrepo.managed:
        - name: deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main contrib non-free
        - file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/squeeze-backports.list
```

Running `state.highstate test=True` reports that changes are going to be made whereas if I remove the test mode, it doesn't do any changes.

Actually, the content of the `squeeze-backports.list` has been copied with the "components" part of the repository specification as `contrib non-free main` (note that the order is different as in the configured state).

So I guess there are two problems here:
- first, I'm not sure if the order of the components in the specification is important (I believe it's not), but since `pkg.expand_repo_def` (as called by the `pkgrepo.managed` state) returns a list, it here detects that the state to be applied and the current one are different and so thinks it has to do something;
- second, `salt.modules.apt.mod_repo` [treat the components part as a set](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/apt.py#L1061) which doesn't guarantee the order and so they got reordered compared to the one specified in the state specification when written to the specified file.
