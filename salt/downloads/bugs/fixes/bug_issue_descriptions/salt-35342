If you remove or rename items in the repo-ng folder on the master, these are not removed from the minion cache when you run win_pkg.refresh_db. Particularly in the case of renaming, it's very likely to generate a name collision for the package which may result in incorrect installation states being returned (the pkg name map can still reference old sls files).

As an example, I'll rename my 7zip directory. It's already cached under it's old name:

<pre>salt salt-test cmd.run 'dir /b c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\files\base\win\repo-ng\*zip' 
salt-test:
    7zip</pre>

I rename it:

<pre>mv /srv/salt/win/repo-ng/7zip /srv/salt/win/repo-ng/seven_zip</pre>

Then run win_pkg.refresh_db, checking that it only lists the renamed directory:

<pre>salt salt-test pkg.refresh_db | grep zip
    - c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\files\base\win\repo-ng\seven_zip\7zip.sls</pre>

But on the minion, I've now got two folders in the cache:

<pre>salt salt-test cmd.run 'dir /b c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\files\base\win\repo-ng\*zip' 
salt-test:
    7zip
    seven_zip</pre>

And worse still the sls file is still there, and this can be matched when generating the name map:

<pre>salt salt-test cmd.run 'type c:\salt\var\cache\salt\minion\files\base\win\repo-ng\7zip\7zip.sls' 
salt-test:
    {% if grains['cpuarch'] == 'AMD64' %}
      {% set name_arch = ' (x64 edition)' %}
      {% set installer_arch = '-x64' %}
    {% else %}
      {% set name_arch = '' %}
      {% set installer_arch = '' %}
    {% endif %}
    
    7zip:
      '15.14.00.0':
        full_name: '7-Zip 15.14{{ name_arch }}'
        installer: 'salt://win/repo-ng/7zip/7z1514{{ installer_arch }}.msi'
        install_flags: '/qn /norestart'
        uninstaller: '{23170F69-40C1-2702-1514-000001000000}'
        uninstall_flags: '/qn /norestart'
        refresh: True
        msiexec: True
        use_scheduler: False
        locale: en_US
        reboot: False
        cache_dir: False
      '9.20.00.0':
        full_name: '7-Zip 9.20{{ name_arch }}'
        installer: 'salt://win/repo-ng/7zip/7z920{{ installer_arch }}.msi'
        install_flags: '/qn /norestart'
        uninstaller: '{23170F69-40C1-2702-0920-000001000000}'
        uninstall_flags: '/qn /norestart'
        refresh: True
        msiexec: True 
        use_scheduler: False
        locale: en_US
        reboot: False
        cache_dir: False</pre>


I can't think of any situation where you would want to maintain items in the repo-ng cache when they don't exist on the master, and trying to clear the cache with saltutil is going to clear the entire cache so I imagine this shouldn't be used during a state run.

So that the master side can be edited, surely pkg.refresh_db needs to be removing anything that doesn't exist any longer?
