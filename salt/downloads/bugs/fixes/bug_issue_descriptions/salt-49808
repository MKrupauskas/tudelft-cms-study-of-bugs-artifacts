Using parallel states will cause a pickling error on Windows:

For example, use the following (it doesn't matter that the commands don't exist):

```yaml
foo:
  cmd.run:
    - parallel: True

bar:
  cmd.run:
    - parallel: True
```

The result will include a traceback like the below:

```pytb

PicklingError: Can't pickle <function backup_mode at 0x000000000709E6D8>: it's not found as salt.loaded.int.module.config.backup_mode
```

This happens on all branches, so this has likely never worked on Windows.
