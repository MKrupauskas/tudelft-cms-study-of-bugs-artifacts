2015.8 Head fails to finish spinning up a Windows VM on AWS. I rolled back to RC3 and salt-cloud completed successfully.

This is the error that shows up:

```
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: SMB SessionError: STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE({File Not Found} The file %hs does not exist.)
Traceback (most recent call last):

        SERVICE_EXIT
```

This might be where it's trying to create the `C:\salttemp` directory. When I go into the VM there is no `C:\salttemp`. In the above Stack Trace you see salt.utils.smb is trying to do a mkdirs... maybe it's somewhere in there.

Good luck...
