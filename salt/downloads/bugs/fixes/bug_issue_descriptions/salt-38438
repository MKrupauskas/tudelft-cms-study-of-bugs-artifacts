### Description of Issue/Question

As per description, if `file.line` with `mode: delete` encounters an empty file, it fails with a stack trace. This is essentially the same problem as reported earlier by #31135, with the fix being similar to #37452 (I'd suggest using `log.info`, though. There's nothing wrong with not finding any delete-match since the file is empty. See `Setup` for an example).

### Setup

```
{% for name, line in pillar.list_of_lines_to_remove_if_found.items() %}
delete {{ name }}:
  file.line:
    - content: na
    - name: /some/path
    - match: {{ line }}
    - mode: delete
{% endfor %}
```
