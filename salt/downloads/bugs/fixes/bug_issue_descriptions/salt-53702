### Description of Issue
This appears to be broken in 2019.2.0....

I can run it from the CLI of the Master server... but as a part of custom module it fails.

Yes - I have set file_recv: True and reset the server.

It seems to work from the CLI if I give it and exact file name... no wild cards.  But if executed from within a module I get:

The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1660, in _thread_return
        return_data = minion_instance.executors[fname](opts, data, func, args, kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/executors/direct_call.py", line 12, in execute
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/var/cache/salt/minion/extmods/modules/custom.py", line 525, in stageReports
        salt.modules.cp.push(targetLocationOfReport,upload_path=reportName)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/cp.py", line 807, in push
        auth = _auth()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/cp.py", line 40, in _auth
        if 'auth' not in __context__:
    NameError: global name '__context__' is not defined

This is frustrating.  Any help with wild card file names from CLI or more importantly from within a module would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

The command from within the module:
`salt.modules.cp.push(targetLocationOfReport,upload_path=reportName)`


If this is not the right place to discuss this please let me know.  Thanks!
The file is less than 100 Mb.  Its a very small text file.

Again, thank you for any help!
