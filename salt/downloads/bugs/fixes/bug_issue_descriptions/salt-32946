### Description of Issue/Question

This is possibly related to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/23270. 

We have the same error, but with a SLES 12 template. Our setup works for a bunch of other VMs including
- Debian 7/8
- Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/16.04
- CentOS 5/6/7
- even SLES 11.4

However, the checkbox "Connect at power on" is not checked in the cloned machine, even if it is checked in the template.

We also already tried to replace vmxnet3 with e1000 network driver.
