The way, the `git_pillar` cache in `/var/cache/salt/master/git_pillar` is currently maintained on the master causes trouble when an item is dropped from or changed in the Master's configuration in `ext_pillar:git`.
Every configuration change needs to be reflected in the cache's state, otherwise various (often hard to track down) issues might occur.
In my case, I was still seeing old pillar data from a repository (and therefore different results on Minion than expected) I stopped maintaining quite some time ago. I removed it back then from my config, but its content was still present in the cache.
- removing an item from `ext_pillar:git` leaves a stale directory behind, which is still synced to Minions
- changing the configuration of an item in `ext_pillar:git` doesn't update the cache directory's content accordingly (e.g. changing the remote branch from `master` to `devel` will still sync the `master` branch, although the debug output of Salt will show the correct branch. This is a result of only initialising the cache directory based on the (then) provided configuration and not verifying on each run whether the cache's state matches the current configuration

By using a hash of the corresponding remote/repo definition as target directory for checking out Pillar repositories and removing those not referenced by any of them should solve this issue:
- every configuration change will cause a new cache directory per remote/repo to be created
- removing a remote/repo configuration will cause it's directory to be deleted as it isn't referenced by any of the config hashes anymore

This happens on `2015.8.3` (packages from `repo.saltstack.com`) and manually updated `salt.utils.gitfs` (a746014f7e68926778f5fa6e95ba2e84584d4d02) and `salt.runners.git_pillar` (6981bb3be737d06ecfc9dfddd15e87fade94905c) from `2015.8`.
- GitPython (version, see below) is used
- The new `2015.8`-style for configuring git_pillar was used.
