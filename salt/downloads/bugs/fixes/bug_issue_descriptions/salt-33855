### network.managed removing bond-slaves from unrelated interfaces without showing changes

We added a few additional interfaces (bridges and gre tunnels) through salt and after applying, the bonding slaves config was missing from the upstream bonding device.

It seems like salt reads in the whole /etc/network/interfaces and **just removes every line it does not understand** and then writes it out again. It also removes all comments meaning it further cripples all documentation an admin made in the config file.
**This destructive behaviour should clearly be documented and warned for!**
### Setup

Quick setup to reproduce the bug is, add this line to a bonding interface, and have at least one network.manage interface for this host.

```
slaves eth0 eth1
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

When running salt-ssh, **even with no reported changes**, salt deletes the slaves line from a bonding interface, leaving the box without network after next reboot.

```
$ salt-ssh ...
