It seems that #15881 introduced a change to append "_master" to the master id.  This changes things so now when I try to run `salt-run state.orch`, I get failures while it tries to pull external pillar data from foreman:

```
[root@salt01 salt]# /usr/bin/salt-run state.orch orchestrate.update_known_hosts
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/bin/foreman-node salt01_master' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/smart_proxy_salt-1.0.0/bin/foreman-node:178: Invalid hostname (RuntimeError)

```

And while this eventually succeeds when run from the commandline, when this is run from a reactor, it simply logs the following failure (and never actually runs the orchestration):

```

```

This is with 2014.7.1.
