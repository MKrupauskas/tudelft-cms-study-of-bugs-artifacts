### Description of Issue/Question

When using source_hash for a file if the source_hash is uppercase for any reason instead of lowercase the while using test=true the file will be detected as changing while with test=false it will not. 

The desired result would be the reaction of test=true being the same as test=false. Detecting that the file isn't changed when the hash is uppercase. 

### Setup
test.txt
```
testing
```

test.sls
```
testing1:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/testing
    - source: http://192.168.70.10/test.txt
    - source_hash: 12a61f4e173fb3a11c05d6471f74728f76231b4a5fcd9667cef3af87a3ae4dc2

testing2:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/test
    - source: http://192.168.70.10/test.txt
    - source_hash: 12A61F4E173FB3A11C05D6471F74728F76231B4A5FCD9667CEF3AF87A3AE4DC2
```
