### Description of Issue
I have two netconfig.managed stanzas for a particular switch. With test=True on the command line, the first instance respects it and does not commit, while the second instance ignores test=True and commits the config.


### Setup
I need to delete the switch config specific stuff, but I don't see that as relevant to this issue anyway.

```
SLS file:
cisco_basic_switch_config:
  netconfig.managed:
    - template_name: salt://{{ slspath }}/files/switch.jinja

cisco_individual_switch_config:
  netconfig.managed:
    - template_name: salt://{{ slspath }}/files/individual_config.jinja

```
When executed, cisco_basic_switch_config works properly and does not commit but then cisco_individual_switch_config runs and unexpectedly does.

This happened during a production maintenance window, so the flurry of unexpected log messages was something of a surprise.

We're moving to collapse these two configs into one, but neither the contents of the configs nor the fact that there are two should result in test=True being ignored.

FWIW, the configs are non-overlapping (one handles interfaces and the other, everything else)


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
I have not attempted to reproduce as my maintenance window has passed, but here is the command and its output (with switch config specifics removed; I'm offering what I can even if it's an imperfect bug report):

```
salt 'switch-a' state.apply test=True

switch-a:
----------
          ID: cisco_basic_switch_config
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: Configuration discarded.
              
              Configuration diff:

< A diff of what would have been done >

     Changes:   
              ----------
              diff:
 < The same diff of what would have been done, a bit verbosely perhaps >
---------
          ID: cisco_individual_switch_config
    Function: netconfig.managed
      Result: True
     Comment: Configuration changed!
     Started: 05:41:37.159805
    Duration: 14933.766 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              diff:

< A diff of actual changes that it actually did >

Summary for switch-a
------------
Succeeded: 2 (unchanged=1, changed=2)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     2
Total run time:  33.515 s

```
I can give this another go in our maintenance window, two weeks from now.
