### Description of Issue/Question

It looks like Salt is using it's own interpreter to decide if the python2 or python3 version of dnf-plugin-versionlock is necessary. The python2 version is no longer available on Fedora 30. `/usr/bin/salt-call` explicitly uses `/usr/bin/python2.7` as it's interpreter meaning that using `hold` with any `pkg.installed` does not work as it cannot find `python2-dnf-plugin-versionlock`.

### Setup
I'm using https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/packages-formula which does the following:

```sls
wanted_pkgs:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs: {{ wanted_packages | json }}
    {% if grains['os_family'] not in ['Suse'] %}
    - hold: false
    {% endif %}
    - require:
      - pkg: pkg_req_pkgs
      {% if req_states %}
        {% for dep in req_states %}
      - sls: {{ dep }}
        {% endfor %}
      {% endif %}
```

The `hold: false` there causes the problem, modifying the conditional to read:

```jinja
{% if grains['os_family'] not in ['Suse'] and (grains['os'] != 'Fedora' or grains['osmajorrelease'] < 30) %}
```

causes the error to go away.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
While I haven't tried this explicitly, it should be possible to use the following state on any Fedora 30 system after installing with the normal salt bootstrapper:

```sls
vim:
    pkg.installed:
        - hold: false
```

### Versions Report

Note: This happens to be a masterless setup so the version report will be from `salt-call`.
