### Description of Issue/Question
postgres_database.present returns -1 but nothing else when it fails.

The minion log, however, contains the useful error message:
```
stderr: ERROR:  new collation (C.UTF-8) is incompatible with the collation of the template database (en_US.UTF-8)
```

This error message is only a demonstration, it seems that on failure, stderr is not used to show a message to the user. In this case, using the postgres formula I set a database with a collation which apparently was incompatible with the template database that postgres uses to create a new one. 

I imagine there might be a simple passing of messages or stdio flow that is either missing or misconfigured in the postgres salt module.
