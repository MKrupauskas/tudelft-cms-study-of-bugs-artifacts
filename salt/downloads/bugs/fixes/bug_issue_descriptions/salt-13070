I'm having problem bootstrapping minions on a Windows Server 2012 R2 machine running in Azure.

In Azure, when launching an image you can choose to run a powershell bootstrap script and I'm running the script below. The script downloads the minion, installs it and starts the service.

```
# Install saltstack minion
$url = "https://myblob.blob.core.windows.net/latest/saltminion.exe";

$saltInstallationFile = "C:\Users\Public\saltstackminion.exe"

If (Test-Path $saltInstallationFile){
    Remove-Item $saltInstallationFile
}

$webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$webclient.DownloadFile($url,$saltInstallationFile)

Write-Host "Installing salt for $env:COMPUTERNAME"

iex "$saltInstallationFile /S /master=mymaster.cloudapp.net /minion-name=$env:COMPUTERNAME"
Start-Sleep -s 10
Start-Service "salt-minion"
```

The service runs as local system account and it connects to the master well. I can run test.ping and get a response. But as soon as I run anything that requires more permissions (as disk access) then I get no response from the minion. I've also noticed that the minion doesn't write anything to it's logs in this mode.

If I stop the service then run it in a console (as admin) with the parameters -l debug things start working again. I can execute states that require disk access, logs are written etc.

So my method of bootstrapping doesn't seem to work well, something is blocking the minion.

**Saltify driver**
I've read about the Saltify driver but I haven't been able to find documentation/examples on how it works to boostrap a new Windows machine. Could you please point me in the right direction?
