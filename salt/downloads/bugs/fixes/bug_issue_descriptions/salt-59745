**Description**
When running any `pkgrepo.managed` state against a RHEL based OS, the configuration is changed every time, despite it being successful.

**Setup**
State:
```
{% set version = 'version' %}
test-repo:
  pkgrepo.managed:
    - humanname: "Our test Repo"
    - name: test_repo
    - baseurl: http://repo.test.com/redhat/{{ grains['osmajorrelease'] }}/{{ grains['osarch'] }}/{{ version[:-2] }}
    - enabled: '1'
    - gpgcheck: '0'
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
The test repo does not exist on the test machines. It is created by Salt and then the state is run again which causes it to be created again.
This has been tested on RHEL 7.7 and OEL 7.9 with the same behaviour seen on both. The `pkgrepo.managed` state works as expected on any Debian based system we have.

**Expected behavior**
The state should create the repo on the first pass and, on any subsequent runs, make no further changes as the repo is in state.
