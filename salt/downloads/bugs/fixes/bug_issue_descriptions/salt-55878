### Description of Issue
On Py 3 only, doing a recursive mode set with file.directory attempts to read and set permissions on symlinks (the links themselves, not targets). This causes salt to show that there were 'changes' on every highstate and could set off other onchanges requisites, even if there where no actual changes.

### Setup
This sls will easily reproduce the issue:
```
/tmp/test547/standard_folder/standard_file:
  file.managed:
    - target: /tmp/test547
    - makedirs: True

/tmp/test547/link_folder/link:
  file.symlink:
    - target: /tmp/test547
    - makedirs: True

/tmp/test547/:
  file.directory:
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - dir_mode: '0755'
    - recurse:
      - mode
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Just doing a state.apply of sls above will show changes on every run even though no changes will actually occur after the initial creation. While this is just a sample, we are running into this issue largely  with virtual envs and they can also be used in troubleshooting. Creating a virtual env and then setting the permissions with a recursive file.directory will produce dozens to hundreds of no-op changes due to the amount of links in a virtual env.

### Versions Report
This has also been tried on 2.1 salt with python 3 with the same issue. Both 2.2 and 2.1 work as expected if using py2 instead of py3
