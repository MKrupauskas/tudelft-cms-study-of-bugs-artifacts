After attempting to launch GoGrid minions in a map file, the first minion installs properly, but an exception prevents the script from continuing. I get the following error: https://gist.github.com/luciddr34m3r/1364babefaa344f0508c

I added a debug statement (the info log line directly above the error), which prints the value of the 'data' variable at the time of the exception on the following line: 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/gogrid.py#L260

update() expects a dictionary, but 'data' at that time is actually a Node object. This seems to be the case if the node creation succeeds, as seen here, or fails, as seen in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/13365 

Not sure if the two issues are directly related, but I was encouraged to raise a new issue for this.
