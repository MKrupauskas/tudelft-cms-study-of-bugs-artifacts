### Description of Issue

A comment causes an exception but is not shown at all.

I would be extremely grateful if Salt would have an extremely robust way to display text, at least in the exception.  E.g. delete all non-ASCII characters.  

Character Ã¼ is not-ASCII but must not be a problem for Salt. 

### Setup
The comment is not reported.
I cannot tell which state in the sls causes the comment

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt MINION state.sls syncP2P

```
