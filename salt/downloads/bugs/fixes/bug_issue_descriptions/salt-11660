The socket.getfqdn() function this is meant to replace will always return a string, even if it's just the hostname for systems that don't have a fully baked DNS configuration (_very_ common in the wild).

Since this commit:

    Replace socket.get_fqdn with internal salt.utils.network.get_fqhostname
```

getfqdn was overridden because of this https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/11275

Until this is more thoroughly tested it is probably a good idea to handle exceptions in the new custom fqdn by passing to the tried and true (if imperfect) standard library version.
