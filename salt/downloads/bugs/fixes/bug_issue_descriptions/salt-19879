I am trying to use Salt State artifactory.downloaded in my sls file and it is throwing error "State 'artifactory.downloaded' found in SLS 'xxxx.pkgs' is unavailable"
The output of salt <minion id> grains.items |grep os is as follows:

```
$> salt minion-id.com grains.items | grep os
    biosreleasedate:
    biosversion:
    host:
    localhost:
    os:
    os_family:
    osarch:
    oscodename:
    osfinger:
    osfullname:
    osmajorrelease:
    osrelease:
    osrelease_info:
```
