Ok,
I wrote the following salt runner:

``` python
import salt.client

def runner (x,y):
  print (str(type(x))+":"+str(x))
  print (str(type(y))+":"+str(y))

```

If you use this runner with salt-run 0777 0778 you will get the following interesting
output:
&lt;type 'int'>:777
&lt;type 'str'>;:0778

So I believe that it's trying to follow the yaml rules for input typing. 0777 is treated in yaml as an octal because it's got a leading 0's and all of the digits are in [0..7]., but 0778 is treated as a string because it's got a leading 0 and not all the digits are in [0..7].

HOWEVER, the salt runner did not treat 0777 as an octal. Instead it treated it as the decimal value of 777. The output should have said
&lt;type 'int'>:511. 
It should not have said 
&lt;type 'int'>:777
