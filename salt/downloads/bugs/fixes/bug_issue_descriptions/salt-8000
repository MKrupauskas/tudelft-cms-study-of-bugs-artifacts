when I run `salt-call state.highstate --out=quiet -l warning` on a minion, I still get a newline of output. This causes my cronjob to email me (since I have configured any cron output to be sent via email). Is there a way to make salt actually run in quiet mode that only outputs actual errors? This would make running via cronjobs cleaner.

I am using salt version 0.17.0
