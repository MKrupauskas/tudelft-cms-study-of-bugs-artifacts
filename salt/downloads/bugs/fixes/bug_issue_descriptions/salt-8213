I'm trying to install a library called princexml using salt, but I'm getting this error:

I'm also getting a similar error from trying to install elasticsearch using the same method. Strangely enough, if I run the line 'dpkg -i --force-confold  /var/cache/salt/minion/extrn_files/base/www.princexml.com/download/prince_9.0-2_ubuntu12.04_amd64.deb' manually, the package installs just fine.
