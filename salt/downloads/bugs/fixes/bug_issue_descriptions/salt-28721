After some hair tearing today, I've discovered that the winrepo MUST live within the file_roots base: 

I had configured the winrepo to be at the same level in my local filesystem as file_roots base: and had some very strange and unhelpful errors as a result.

Seems that if this is a dependency, that the configuration should require a relative path instead of absolute.
