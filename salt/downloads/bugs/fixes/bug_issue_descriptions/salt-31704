### Description of Issue/Question

There is a bug in using foreman-node as the external pillar which prevents successful state execution, as the pillar data returns empty. I haven't dug into whether this is an error on the part of Foreman or SaltStack. The issue for that is [here](http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/13558). 

As a work-around I switched us to using the foreman pillar. The foreman.py code would not load, due to **virtualname** and json functionality failures.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Follow the documentation to add foreman as the external pillar. Try to refresh pillar data.
