Apologies in advance if this is a known issue, limitation or a misunderstanding on my part - but I am seeing an issue with `salt.state.locale.present` on Debian 7 whereby Salt is reporting that a locale was generated, but in fact it was not.

I _think_ this is because Salt is simply calling `locale-gen <locale>` rather than manipulating `/etc/locale.gen` and/or calling `dpkg-reconfigure locales`

To reproduce this, simply specify a locale to be generated like so:

``` yaml
en_GB.UTF-8:
  locale.present
```

Applying this yields the following result:

```
----------
          ID: en_GB.UTF-8
    Function: locale.present
      Result: True
     Comment: Generated locale en_GB.UTF-8
     Started: 18:02:15.572997
     Duration: 701 ms
     Changes:
              ----------
              locale:
                  en_GB.UTF-8
```

However applying the configuration again yields the same message, indicating that the locale was in fact not generated.

I have verified this approach does not work with Debian 7 via the command line:

```
root@debian-7:/home/vagrant# locale -a
C
C.UTF-8
en_US.utf8
POSIX
```

Then:

```
root@debian-7:/home/vagrant# locale-gen en_GB.UTF-8
Generating locales (this might take a while)...
  en_US.UTF-8... done
Generation complete.
```

As you can see, the command line argument was ignored.  Further illustrated by running `locale -a` again:

```
root@debian-7:/home/vagrant# locale -a
C
C.UTF-8
en_US.utf8
POSIX
```

Lastly, according to `man locale-gen`, using `/etc/locale.gen` is the correct method and no command line arguments are documented.

My `salt --versions-report`:
