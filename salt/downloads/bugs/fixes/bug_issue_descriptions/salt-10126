The service.running state seems to be misbehaving on Ubuntu 13.10. It reports failures for services which are already running.

```
...
[INFO    ] Executing state service.running for ssh
[INFO    ] Executing command 'runlevel /run/utmp' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'service ssh status' in directory '/root'
[INFO    ] Executing command 'service ssh start' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] Service ssh failed to start
...
```

I verified that the "ssh" service is running. Moreover, running `salt-call service.status ssh` reports `True`, so I don't know why `service start ssh` was called at all. Trying to run `salt-call upstart.status ssh` tells me that the module is not available.

Here is the versions report:

```
           Salt: 0.17.5
         Python: 2.7.4 (default, Sep 26 2013, 03:20:26)
