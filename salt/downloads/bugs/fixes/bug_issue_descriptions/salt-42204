### Description of Issue/Question
Getting SSLERROR when using https source for file.managed.  Running http.query gives same error.

The HTTPS sites have certificates that are signed by an internal CA, however, that CA is installed on the server.  Neither wget nor curl complain when downloading the same file.  

Code to install certs:
```
ca_certificates:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: ca-certificates

ca_bundle_cert:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    - source: salt://fctm-managed/files/tls-ca-bundle.pem
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 444
    - require:
      - pkg: ca_certificates

ca_bundle_trust_cert:
  file.managed:
    - name: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt
    - source: salt://fctm-managed/files/ca-bundle.trust.crt
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 444
    - require:
      - pkg: ca_certificates
```
Example error:
```
[root@xxxxxxxxxx tmp]# salt 'xxxxxxxx' http.query 'https://one-of-our-internal-servers'
xxxxxxxx:
