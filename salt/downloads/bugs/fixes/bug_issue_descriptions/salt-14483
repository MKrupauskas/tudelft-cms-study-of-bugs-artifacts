I recently upgraded to 2014.1.7 via APT packages and all my pillar data stopped working. I exclusively use ext_pillar data. Thinking it might have been a problem with the APT packages I removed them, purged them and then installed from git. 

Essentially what I found is that the salt-master had to be running 2014.1.5 for any of my minions to resolve their pillar data. It appears that the minions don't have a problem being 2014.1.7, but it seems to be something with the master.

The master had no errors and was showing that it was updating the ext_pillar sources, but no dice on the minions.

Unfortunately I'm not in a position troubleshoot that further, it took me a couple hours to figure out the problem and once i did I had to get my production system back online by downgrading.

I could be wrong, but thought it best to put in a ticket. Thanks.
