**Version: 2014.7.0.rc5**

Unfortunately I do not have any cold hard facts or errors or anything of real substance to add to this ticket, except that I've had about a dozen minions just stop communicating with the master. There is absolutely no errors in the logs on either the master or the minion. A restart of the minion service corrects the problem.

I have noticed that almost every minion I've had to restart the last few long entries look like this ..

```

```

Everyone I've noticed this happen to has the handling event pillar_refresh

I have also attempted to SIGUSR1 the process to get a stack trace but the process isn't hung as far as I can tell and the logs just state that it is stopping in the logs and that is it.

I realize this is not much to go on, but its a recurring problem.
