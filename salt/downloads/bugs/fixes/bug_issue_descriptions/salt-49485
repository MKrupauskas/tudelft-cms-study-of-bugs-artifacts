### Description of Issue/Question
When provisioning a vm (either lxc or kvm) on a proxmox cluster, the salt-cloud command fails with this error : 
```
KeyError: u'name'
```

This happens approximately 1 out of 3 tries, on different proxmox nodes and different site too.

Proxmox are as follow : 
```
Kernel Version Linux 4.15.18-1-pve #1 SMP PVE 4.15.18-15 (Wed, 04 Jul 2018 15:42:56 +0200)
--
PVE Manager Version pve-manager/5.2-5/eb24855a
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
just run a standard salt-cloud command based on map files : 
`
sudo /usr/bin/salt-cloud -y -m /etc/salt/map.d/ams_nightly.map
`

### More about this
I can quite easily reproduce this (this has been happening since the very beginning of my salt-cloud experience, around a year ago).

Any ideas or hint about the root cause of this ?

is this due to a mis-communication between the node api and the salt-cloud engine ? some params lost on their way ?

If I launch this map file another time after it has 99% of chance for being correctly handled, sometimes I need 2 or 3 tries before it gets ok.
This issue is particularly blocking in our CI pipeline (we are building container to check the salt states, and this all starts by provisioning a new vm ....)


Thanks
