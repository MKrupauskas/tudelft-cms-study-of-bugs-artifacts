### Description of Issue/Question

When running multi-master failover when neither master is up and running the process dies and I run into the following error:

```
[INFO    ] Master 192.168.50.11 could not be reached, trying next master (if any)
[ERROR   ] No master could be reached or all masters denied the minions connection attempt.
[ERROR   ] Error while bringing up minion for multi-master. Is master at 192.168.50.11 responding?
[ERROR   ] master_type set to 'failover' but 'master' is not of type list but of type <type 'str'>
```

Even though my master config is indeed a list:

```
root@saltminion1:~# grep -E -v '^$|#' /etc/salt/minion
master:
  - 192.168.50.10
  - 192.168.50.11
master_type: failover
id: minion1
log_level: debug
```

And this works normally when the masters are running correctly. So I believe the settings are correct.
### Setup

2 masters 1 minion with config above
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. make sure the masters are not running
2. start the minion and watch as it attempts to connect to teh masters and then dies with the error. HEre is the full debug output:
