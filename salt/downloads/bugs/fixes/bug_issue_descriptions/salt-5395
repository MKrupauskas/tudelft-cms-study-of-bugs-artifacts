A process/thread is started and then immediately joined (i.e wait for it to end).

On *nix, with multiprocessing==True, the process is daemonized so join returns almost immediately.

For the threaded minion on *nix or both the multiprocessing and threaded minion on windows this blocks the minion until the job completes. saltutils.find_job request are queued and the job probably times out on the client side.
