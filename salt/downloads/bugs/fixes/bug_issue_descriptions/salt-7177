I just installed from the FreeBSD ports (/usr/ports/sysutils/py-salt), edited the minion configuration to set the master host, and start to make some basic tests 'salt '*' test.ping'

After a couple of days I tried to access the FreeBSD jail running the minion and I notice that I have reached the max allowed process, checking the process I notice that minion is creating a process every hour. 

Besides creating multiple process, the connection with the master gets lost, and minion only reconnects after manually restarting it.

Both minion/master run FreeBSD 9.1 (amd64)
