This is what I see running  smth like https://github.com/rentalita/ubuntu-setup/blob/master/salt/gitolite/init.sls#L4-L7 For the sake of readability - will copy it here as well

```
gitolite:
  pkg:
    - latest
    - debconf: salt://gitolite/gitolite.answers
```

**Out**

```

## 

Initially I thought this option is not supported, since this option seemed not be state module, but instead salt module (I might misuse terminology, using the terms used in salt documentation pages)

[Salt state module](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/all/salt.states.pkg.html#module-salt.states.pkg) has no mention of it, however seems in might be supported (especially if found online examples it's usage, see above)

[Salt apt module](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.apt.html#salt.modules.apt.install) however lists debconf as supported option.

Initially I asked questions about this on salt-user iirc channel and got initial response I mix salt states and salt-modules. However since I have both found the online example (presumably working) and failed to run salt-module (see below) as documented - I decided to submit my question in the form of github issue. imo, either documentation or code is broken.

**Questions**
- is debconf supported as part of state module option?
- is debconf supported as part of sast system module? e.g. 

```
salt-ssh '*'  pkg.install gitolite 'debconf=salt://gitolite/gitolite.answers'
minion1:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt-call", line 4, in <module>
        salt_call()
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt/scripts.py", line 82, in salt_call
        client.run()
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt/cli/__init__.py", line 313, in run
        caller.run()
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt/cli/caller.py", line 137, in run
        ret = self.call()
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt/cli/caller.py", line 78, in call
        ret['return'] = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/tmp/.salt/salt/modules/apt.py", line 378, in install
        __salt__['debconf.set_file'](debconf)
    KeyError: 'debconf.set_file'
```
- is debconf just broken with salt-ssh or broken in last/development? _Note_: The way I've installed salt is as documented at saltstack/salt-bootstrap e.g. `curl -L http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh -s -- git develop`
