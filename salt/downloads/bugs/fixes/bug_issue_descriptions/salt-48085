### Description of Issue/Question

Run `virt.get_disks` on a VM with such a setup:

* At least one disk with a qcow2 image with several backing files chained to each other
* At least one non-qcow2 image

The first problem is rather an inconsistency: the detailed `qemu-img info` output is only added for qcow2 files... why not other disk images like raw, qed, etc?

The output of the `qemu-img info` is rather badly parsed, for example:

* the snapshots date doesn't have the time part,
* if the snapshot name has a space in it, the name won't be complete
* the `format specific` lines are added to the snapshot list... they could be dropped or moved to the parent level

### Setup

This can be reproduced even with proper unit tests.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
