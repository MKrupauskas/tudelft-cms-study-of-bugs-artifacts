Hello,

For the versions salt 2015.8.1 (Beryllium) and salt 2015.5.2 (Lithium) I have run into the problem that `git.latest` doesn't checkout the submodules when asked to do so.

Here's an example configuration to reproduce the problem

``` yaml
git_latest:
  git.latest:
    - name: https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-android.git
    - target: /tmp/linphone
    - rev: master
    - submodules: True
```

```
vm:
----------
          ID: git_latest
    Function: git.latest
        Name: https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-android.git
      Result: True
     Comment: https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-android.git cloned to /tmp/linphone
