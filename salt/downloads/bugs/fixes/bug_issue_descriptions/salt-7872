I spoke with Seth and he confirmed it was a bug and asked that I file it as an issue. Without further ado...

Deleting grains doesn't seem to work like it should in v.17. I run grains.delval but it doesn't actually delete the grain but rather only it’s value. This matters since I have code that not only looks at the value of a grain but acts differently if the grain is present vs. not present (I'm using the grains to encode minion state in a state machine sense, and I need to be able to discretely move between states).

Here’s an example:

```
[root@salt-master base]# salt 'salt-minion-00*' -v grains.setval foo bar --out json
Executing job with jid 20131009201650172154
-------------------------------------------

{
    "salt-minion-00": {
        "foo": "bar"
    }
}

[root@salt-master base]# salt 'salt-minion-00*' -v grains.delval foo --out json
Executing job with jid 20131009201720910261
-------------------------------------------

{
    "salt-minion-00": null
}

[root@salt-master base]# salt 'salt-minion-00*' -v cmd.run "cat /etc/salt/grains"
Executing job with jid 20131009201748806515
-------------------------------------------

salt-minion-00:
    foo: null
```

Although not related to this issue, I'm a big fan of the new grains functions introduced in v.17 (delval, remove, append). Will these functions be made available in the grains states api as well? At present only "present" is available which reproduces the grains.setval functionality.

Thanks.
