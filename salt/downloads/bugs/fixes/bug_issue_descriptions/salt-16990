Since introducing multiple environments in the master's file_roots we have a weird behavious for minions that are "far" from the master. Theses minions are in a different datacenter and communicate with the master via ssh tunnel or openvpn. 

What we periodically get is : 

```
# salt-call state.sls shorewall test=True
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'shorewall' in env 'base'
```

restart the command and it works. 

I have a detailed log diff if you want. But basically it adds a bunch of

```
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** skipped ** latest already in cache 'salt://XXX'
```

and works.
