I just installed a VM with FreeBSD 10-RC5 for testing Salt. I ran pkg on the minion to bootstrap pkgng and pkg install worked on the minion/vm. Every time I tried to install a package with Salt it failed with an exception.

After digging around it seems that pkgng in Salt is activated when /usr/local/etc/pkg.conf is detected. In FreeBSD 10 (scheduled to be released on monday I think) this file seems not to exist any more. I just did a clean install in a new VM and the file isn't there any more. pkg.conf.sample is but not pkg.conf so using this file for activating pkgng on FreeBSD 10 will probably fail.
