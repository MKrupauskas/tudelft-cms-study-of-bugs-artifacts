I've got several SuSE 11.3 servers that are generating the following error when trying to start the minion:
`ImportError: cannot import name PKCS1_OAEP`

The full log trace is at:
https://gist.github.com/racooper/751b5f1b232209917d30

The system has pycrypto 2.6.1-36 installed.  The same salt minion is working on other SuSE 11.3 servers with 2.6.1-35, 2.6.1-36, and 2.6.1-39, so I'm not sure what's causing the issue. Any suggestions? (asking here because Freenode is still under DDOS.)
