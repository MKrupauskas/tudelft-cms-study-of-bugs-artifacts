Salt master version: 2014.1.0 
Salt minion version: 2014.1.0
Both master and minion are running on OSX. 

Running "salt '*' state.highstate" fails with no errors in the logs. 

Running "salt-call state.highstate" on the minion works just fine for the same state tree. 

I downgraded to version 0.17.5 for both master and minion and now calling highstate from the master machine works as expected.

While on version 2014.1.0:

Unfortunately the logs for both master and minion are mostly quite(nothing out of the ordinary). The only interesting output that is different from calling highstate from remote vs local is the following:

```
Handling event 'module_refresh||||||\x81\xa6_stamp\xba2014-03-24_12:22:04.788187'
```

Also, if i run the salt-minion in the foreground i would get the error below. Once i ran the salt-minion in the background the error went away. I do think this is a separate bug, but not sure if its related.

```

With version 0.17.5, the above error doesn't exist if i run salt in the foreground.

Another coworker experienced the same failure while running salt on linux machines.
