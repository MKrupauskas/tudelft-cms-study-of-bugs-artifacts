### Description of Issue/Question
Testing the latest 2018.3 branch since we needed a few mysql module fixes in it that didn't make it to a stable release, and we are now seeing an error when setting up a minion to connect to a local master using `127.0.0.1` as address.

`2019-01-21 17:00:20,178 [salt.cli.daemons :357 ][ERROR   ][30809] Master address: '127.0.0.1' could not be resolved. Invalid or unresolveable address. Set 'master' value in minion config.`

Using `localhost` instead, works as expected.

### Setup
Minion configuration is:

```
id: test.domain
metadata_server_grains: True
use_superseded: [ 'module.run' ]
log_level: "info"
master: "127.0.0.1"
```
This config is done by salt-cloud as part of our automated environment, so we really cannot set anything other than 127.0.0.1 for the first bootstrap. 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Use latest 2018.3 branch and setup minion to connect to a local master using 127.0.0.1 as address.
