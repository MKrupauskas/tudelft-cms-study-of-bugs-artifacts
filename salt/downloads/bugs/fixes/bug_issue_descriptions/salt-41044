### Description of Issue/Question

Using this state:

```
testuser:
  user.present:
    - system: False
    - home: /home/testuser
    - shell: /bin/bash
    - password: (some password hash)
    - date: 0
```

Upon application to a minion using `state.apply`, the user gets created with the correct parameters EXCEPT for the password age (supposedly set by 'date'):

```
# chage -l testuser
Last password change                                    : May 03, 2017
Password expires                                        : never
Password inactive                                       : never
Account expires                                         : never
Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
Maximum number of days between password change          : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
```

But, when I run the `shadow.set_date` module against the account, it works fine:

```
salt minion.domain.com shadow.set_date testuser 0
```

```
# chage -l testuser
Last password change                                    : password must be changed
Password expires                                        : password must be changed
Password inactive                                       : password must be changed
Account expires                                         : never
Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
Maximum number of days between password change          : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
```
