This is probably Windows specific and related to changes here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/d6adfb6d126831cc47ffeee167b8900b079516c6

Depending on the internal format of the zip file, the archive.extracted state may return a failure, implying that content which is already extracted is the wrong type.

<pre># cat testing.sls
7zip_test:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: C:\made_in_7zip
    - source: salt://archive_7zip.zip
    - source_hash: md5=3a6b51aa96d73409bc919e343ba7e61b
    - archive_format: zip
    - enforce_toplevel: False

explorer_test:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: C:\made_in_explorer            
    - source: salt://archive_explorer.zip
    - source_hash: md5=c73fb61cf82eb726c96e54bf845bec90
    - archive_format: zip
    - enforce_toplevel: False</pre>
There is no problem applying when the archive hasn't been extracted yet:
<pre># salt salt-test state.apply testing
salt-test:

    Function: archive.extracted

                  - New folder/New Text Document.txt
                  - New Text Document.txt</pre>
...but note the list of extracted files differs between the two. Applying it a second time returns a failure for the first zip file, but not the second:
<pre># salt salt-test state.apply testing
salt-test:
----------
          ID: 7zip_test
    Function: archive.extracted
        Name: C:\made_in_7zip
      Result: False
     Comment: The below paths (relative to C:\made_in_7zip\) exist, but are the incorrect type (file instead of directory, symlink instead of file, etc.). To proceed with extraction, set 'force' to True. Note that this will remove these paths before extracting.

You can see the difference with zipinfo. The extracted contents are identical, but the internal structure is different between the two.
<pre># zipinfo archive_7zip.zip

Modifying to add the force option returns a different error, but I imagine the underlying issue is the same:
<pre># cat testing.sls
7zip_test:
  archive.extracted:
    - name: C:\made_in_7zip
    - source: salt://archive_7zip.zip
    - source_hash: md5=3a6b51aa96d73409bc919e343ba7e61b
    - archive_format: zip
    - enforce_toplevel: False
    - force: True</pre>

<pre># salt salt-test state.apply testing
salt-test:
----------
          ID: 7zip_test
    Function: archive.extracted
        Name: C:\made_in_7zip
      Result: False
     Comment: One or more paths existed by were the incorrect type (i.e. file instead of directory or vice-versa), but could not be removed. The following errors were observed:
              
              - [Error 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\made_in_7zip\\New folder/'

This problem is new to 2016.11.2 (did not exist in 2016.11.1).
