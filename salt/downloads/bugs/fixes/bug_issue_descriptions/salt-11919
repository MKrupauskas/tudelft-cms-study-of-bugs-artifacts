We're seeing our minions sometimes stop executing scheduled commands, logging the "'schedule.handle_func: The scheduled job {0} was not started, {1} already running" message.

There is a stale file in /var/cache/salt/minion/proc, for a PID which no longer exists.  From inspection of the source, seems like handle_func doesn't ensure that this is removed if the function it calls throws an exception.

Belt and braces: should fix the error handling so that the proc file is removed in a finally: block, and also while checking for running jobs check that their PIDs still exist.
