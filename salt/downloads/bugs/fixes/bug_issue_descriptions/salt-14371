I recently upgraded to 2014.1.7 and I noticed that my Tomcat state were very slow.  Other state were running smootly, the difference being that my Tomcat state is quite large.

How to reproduce 
Create a test state like this :

```
{% for number in range(0,100000) %}
/tmp/{{number}}:
  file.touch
{% endfor %}
```

```
#salt-call state.sls test

```

It take around 3 seconds per touch.  If you decrease the counter to 100, it will take only a few ms beetween each touch.
