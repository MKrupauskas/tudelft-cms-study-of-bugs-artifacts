**Description**
When I call _win_network.ping_ on a Windows machine with the value of _return_boolean_ set to _True_, when the return value is _False_ it also returns with a non-zero exit code. Perhaps this is reasonable when it fails to ping and you are not returning a boolean. When it is supposed to just return a boolean and fails to ping, I don't consider this to be an error condition per se. It should just return false and it should have a non-zero exit code.

The same thing happens with Linux machines.

It should just return false with a zero code exit when pinging fails (or the hostname does not resolve).

**Setup**
No specific setup

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Issue a command like
```
salt -t 50 my_minion network.ping nonexistanthost return_boolean=True
```
The result will be:
```
my_minion:
    False
ERROR: Minions returned with non-zero exit code
```

**Expected behavior**
We should have the same behaviour but the exit code should just be 0. From the point of view of the user a return value of False is sufficient, and no error has ocurred.
