**Description**
Minions which are not included in the accepted keys list from `salt-key -L` nor `ls /etc/salt/pki/master/minions` are connected and returning when using `*` targeting.

**Setup**
`auto_accept: True` on the master. These might have been minions which were previously accepted but now are not. 

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Issue `salt \* test.ping`. Observe minions which respond, that are not listed under accepted keys.

**Expected behavior**
Minions which are not in accepted keys should not be able to communicate with a salt master, at all.
