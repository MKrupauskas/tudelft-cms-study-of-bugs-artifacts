This function wraps the `check` command to parted which has been removed from recent versions and in slightly older versions was marked in the docs as not recommended for use. The `check` command is/was only valid against ext2 filesystems and similar to parted's `mkpartfs` command it uses it's own builtin knowledge of the ext2 filesystem which is unsophisticated and forked from the mainline linux source.
