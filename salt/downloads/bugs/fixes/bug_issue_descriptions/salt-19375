I have noticed that salt-minion sometimes fails to start on a server (especially an LXC container or VM where things may be a little slow during startup) when using systemd. If I merely wait 30 seconds and run systemctl start salt-minion, things work fine.

Can you add something to the systemd service file (/lib/systemd/system/salt-minion.service) so that the service attempts to restart five times, separated by 15 seconds each time? I think that would make salt-minion more robust during boot.
