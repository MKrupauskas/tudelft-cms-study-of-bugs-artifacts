In a mulitmaster failover setup on head of develop with two masters and two minions. The minions will not failover to other master if original master is stopped. 

### Setup
In minion config, min1:
```
grep '^[^#]' /etc/salt/minion
master:
  - 173.255.213.176
  - 23.239.21.111
id: min1
master_shuffle: True
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
```

In minion config, min2:
```
grep '^[^#]' /etc/salt/minion
master:
  - 173.255.213.176
  - 23.239.21.111
id: min2
master_shuffle: True
master_type: failover
master_alive_interval: 30
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Set up multimaster failover environment with two master and two minions. Make sure minion responds only to one master, then stop that master and minions does not failover to second master.

I see this traceback in the logs on both minions:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/schedule.py", line 837, in handle_func
    ret['return'] = self.functions[func](*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/status.py", line 1058, in master
    connected_ips = _connected_masters()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/utils/minion.py", line 65, in connected_masters
    config_port = __salt__['config.get']('publish_port')
NameError: global name '__salt__' is not defined
```
