The freebsdports state in git currently relies on the options configured in /var/db/ports/*/options or similar. The options specified in that file only contain information about the ports build configuration not information about currently installed ports (also known as packages).

If one installs a package without the IPV6 option for example, then runs "make config" and enables the IPV6 option, but does not build and install the package the ports state will incorrectly think that the port is already installed with the IPV6 option when it is in fact not.

On systems with pkgng (FreeBSD 10 by default - earlier versions pkgng is not the default but can be used) the command "pkg info -R <package/port name>" will output json with a dictionary "options" that will show the options of the currently installed package. I assume this information can be obtained on older versions of FreeBSD not using pkgng as well via the pkg_ tools, but I don't have any such systems handy to determine the correct way to obtain this information.

Otherwise a very handy state. :)
