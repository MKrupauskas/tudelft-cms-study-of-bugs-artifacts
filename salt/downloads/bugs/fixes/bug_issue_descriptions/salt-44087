### Description of Issue/Question

In case of a invalid sls entry using `state.highstate terse=true` can cause a meaningless exception instead of the real error message.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Add a duplicate SLS ID to a state file.
This should result in a message like follows if `state.highstate` is applied.:

```
Data failed to compile:
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
```

But if `state.highstate terse=true` is run, the following error is returned:

```
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1470, in _thread_return

        return d.iteritems(**kw)
