### Description of Issue/Question

Windows minions keep trying to connect when the master key has changed/renewed, when the minion has an outdated minion_master.pub file.

At least 10 connects per second per minion, after manually removing minion_master.pub things calmed down.

### Setup

Latest Salstack

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Let the Saltmaster create a new key, restart salt-master, accept minions again. Windows minions will DoS salt-master with auth/accept but will never connect.
