I am running into a strange issue using the win_servermanager module.  It looks like while running the Get-WindowsFeature command from salt, it thinks it is not on a server OS.  As shown in the gist, when I run the command just in powershell it works as expected, so I dont know where it is getting confused.
- This is on Windows Server 2012 R2, using the 2015.8 release of saltstack.  
- The same behavior happens when using cmd.run
