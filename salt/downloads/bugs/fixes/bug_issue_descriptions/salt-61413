**Description**

The portion of salt-cloud that restarts the minion service after laying down new config is using something similar to the following to restart the minion service.

```
sc salt-minion stop
time.sleep(5)
sc salt-minion start
```

The `SC` command runs asynchronously. The return code is that the command was issued successfully, not that the service actually stopped or started. The 5 second sleep assumes enough time has passed that the service has stopped. This presents a race condition where sometimes the service takes more than 5 seconds to stop, so you don't always see the error.

The `NET` command should be used instead. It runs synchronously and the return code is the success or failure of the start/stop action. This negates the need for the sleep command and avoids the race condition.
