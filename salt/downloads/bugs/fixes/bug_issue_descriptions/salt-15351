`onlyif` accecpts a single condition or a list of conditions. (At least the compiler accepts both)

In the first fragment `onlyif` has a list of one condition.
In the second fragment `onlyif` has a single condition.
The condition is undefined.

_DESIRED BEHAVIOUR:_ the result of the two fragements is identical.
_ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR:_ Saltstack decides that the list is always true, the single condition always false.

Daniel Jagszent suggested that the first fragment uses "wrong syntax"

Should this be actually the case then:
_DESIRED BEHAVIOUR:_ Saltstack rejects "wrong syntax"
_ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR:_ Saltstack ignores "wrong syntax"

Disclaimer: I have only tested this for an undefined test, and for Windows.  Someone should use a decidable test.
