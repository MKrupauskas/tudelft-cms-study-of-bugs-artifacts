### Description of Issue/Question

The documentation states that the `clonenum_start` is supported for range interfaces.
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.network.html
It seems this was supported in RHEL6, but no longer is in RHEL7.

### Setup

```
'eth0-range0':
  network.managed:
    - type: eth
    - ipaddr_start: 10.31.0.211
    - ipaddr_end: 10.31.0.220
    - clonenum_start: 0
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

if the state before is applied, the generated `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0-range0` misses the `CLONENUM_START` parameter.

```
DEVICE="eth0-range0"
USERCTL="no"
TYPE="Ethernet"
ONBOOT="yes"
IPADDR_START="10.31.0.211"
IPADDR_END="10.31.0.220"
NM_CONTROLLED="no"
```
