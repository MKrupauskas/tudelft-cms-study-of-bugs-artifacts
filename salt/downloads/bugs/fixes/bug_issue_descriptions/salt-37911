Hi All
   I was using salt-2015 earlier and now upgraded to salt-ssh 2016.3.4 (Boron). But I am facing a problem after that. 
   
   If I set a grain for example using this:

   salt-ssh --roster-file /etc/rosters/example \* grains.setval test_grain sometestval

   And try to get the value of the grain using:

  salt-ssh --roster-file /etc/rosters/example \* grains.get test_grain

  I don't get the value back. However if I wait for a few minutes and try the grains.get again I get the value. 

  Can someone please help as to what may be going on, does it require a new configuration to be set somewhere?

  thanks
  Asif

### Roster file

master-1:
   host: 192.168.0.108
   user: ubuntu
   sudo: True
   thin_dir: /opt/config/grains

master-2:
   host: 192.168.0.27
   user: ubuntu
   sudo: True
   thin_dir: /opt/config/grains

master-3:
   host: 192.168.0.183
   user: ubuntu
   sudo: True
   thin_dir: /opt/config/grains


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
salt-ssh --roster-file /opt/config/rosters/test master-* grains.setval test 'abc'

Following doesn't return the value back
salt-ssh --roster-file /opt/config/rosters/test master-* grains.get test
