I am running the latest version of SaltStack 2014.1.1 and I have encountered an error with the `startup_states` directive on the Salt minion. The `startup_states` does not seem to execute a highstate when the minion starts, the configuration I am using 

``` bash
$ salt-minion --versions-report
           Salt: 2014.1.1
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Nov 21 2013, 10:50:32)
         Jinja2: unknown
       M2Crypto: 0.20.2
 msgpack-python: 0.1.13
   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.0.1
         PyYAML: 3.10
          PyZMQ: 2.2.0.1
            ZMQ: 3.2.4
```

The minions configuration

```
# 'highstate' -- Execute state.highstate
# 'sls' -- Read in the sls_list option and execute the named sls files
# 'top' -- Read top_file option and execute based on that file on the Master
startup_states: highstate
```

I noticed that the `minion.py` file runs the `tune_in_no_block` function which does not call the `_state_run` function so the `startup_states` directive is never read. 

On line 1422 I would like to add the following

``` python
# On first startup execute a state run if configured to do so
self._state_run()
time.sleep(.5)
```

I will try and submit a pull request this evening to address this issue.
