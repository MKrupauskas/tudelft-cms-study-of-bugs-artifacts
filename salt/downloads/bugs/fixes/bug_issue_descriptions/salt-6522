I have a fairly simple sls to mount a NFS volume from a NetApp:

```
nfs-utils:
   pkg.installed

 /srv:
   mount.mounted:
    - device: 10.6.16.72:/vol/Web09
    - fstype: nfs
    - opts: vers=3
    - persist: True
    - require:
       - pkg: nfs-utils
```

This worked fine until 0.16.2, now I get:

```
----------
    State: - mount
    Name:      /srv
    Function:  mounted
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1239, in call
    ret = self.states[cdata['full']](*cdata['args'])
   File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/mount.py", line 109, in mounted
    if ret['changes']['mount']:
KeyError: 'mount'

        Changes:   
```

Seems likely that this is related to commit 0c9bcab35507f4307126322a86fdcbb6bccd425b
