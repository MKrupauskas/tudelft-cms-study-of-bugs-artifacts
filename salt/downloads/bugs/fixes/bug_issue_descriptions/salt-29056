``` python
Tomcat:
    file.managed:
        - source: {{ pillar['modesto_tomcat7']['download_link'] }}
        - source_hash: md5=84cc20cfcecc0a8953f8c5fee4e2d4dd
        - name: {{ pillar['modesto_tomcat7']['download_location'] }}
        - user: root
        - group: root
        - mode: 644
        - unless: ls -lah {{ pillar['modesto_tomcat7']['download_location'] }}
```

Now this is for tomcat7 .tar.gz.  The actual hash is '5e4cb4c1582e73ad10563f26729c39b6' but Salt insists it's 84cc20cfcecc0a8953f8c5fee4e2d4dd

The download link is 'http://www.carfab.com/apachesoftware/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.65/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.65.tar.gz'

This may be due to the fact that reload_module isn't set to 'True,' but that parameter does not exist in file.managed module and salt may be checking md5 upon file creation rather than download completion.

I did try to capture the md5 when the download is initiated, however I did not see the same hash salt reported.  Also salt reported the same hash three times, so at least it's consistent.

I did solve the issue with a cmd.run which has reload_module parameter but I feel in this case it should also be included in file.managed.
