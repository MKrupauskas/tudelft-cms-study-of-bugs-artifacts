The following returners return a list of jids from get_jids: cassandra_cql_return, couchdb_return, etcd_return, memcache_return, mongo_future_return, mysql, odbc, postgres, redis_return, and sqlite3_return.

The following returners return a dictionary of jids from get_jids: couchbase_return, local_cache, multi_returner, and postgres_local_cache

Both lists and dictionaries provide an iterator when used in a for...in... context (for <variable> in <iterable>). Therefore, this is likely not to be a huge problem if the caller of get_jids is simply iterating over a list of jids or a list of dictionary keys. However, this is a problem when assumptions are made about the returned data structure and datatype-specific functions are called. For example, mysql.get_jids().copy() will fail, because the mysql returner returns a list and a list does not have a copy function. local_cache.get_jids().copy() will not fail, because local_cache.get_jids() returns a dictionary.
