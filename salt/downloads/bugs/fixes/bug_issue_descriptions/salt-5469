I try this command but in my minion this command work by if it call that from the master it's jam and take infinite time

```
start_service:
   cmd.run:
      - name: 'service manticore start'
      - user: test_dev
      - group: test_dev
```

I change for this command

```
manticore:
   service:
      - running
      - enable: true
      - reload: true
      - require:
        - file: /etc/init.d/manticore
```

result:

```
----------
    State: - service
    Name:      manticore
    Function:  running
        Result:    True
        Comment:   Service manticore is already enabled, and is in the desired state
