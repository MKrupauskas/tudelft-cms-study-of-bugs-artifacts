I try to provision a kvm-guest with 3 interfaces. virt.nic is correctly reflected in hypervisors pillar.items:

```
       triple:
            ----------
            eth0:
                ----------
                bridge:
                    xbr0
            eth1:
                ----------
                bridge:
                    virbr1
            eth2:
                ----------
                bridge:
                    virbr2
```

However the guest will reverse or randomize the bridge to interface order, assigning eth0 to virbr2. 
How can I force a match between pillar data and guest interfaces and make sure the external bridge xbr0 always ends up as eth0 in the guest?
