**Description**

When `pip-tools-compile-impersonate` runs, during a `pre-commit` run to attempt updating the dependency tree, output can result in `*.log` dumps being added into `requirements/static/*/py*/*.log`.

`.gitignore` currently ignores `requirements/static/py*/*.log`, which is missing an extra subdir path.

**Setup**

`git clone` the `salt` repo.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Modify a `requirements/*` file, to trigger `pre-commit`. Upon a failure, log files will be dumped in subdirs, and appear in a `git status` call as git isn't ignoring them.

**Expected behavior**

`requirements/static/*/py*/*.log` should be ignored by git.
