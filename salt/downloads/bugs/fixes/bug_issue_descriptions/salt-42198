### Description of Issue/Question
The state **sqlite3.row_absent** is failing with : 
```
master:
----------
          ID: vm-del-dns-us1-dns-node02
    Function: sqlite3.row_absent
      Result: False
     Comment: parameters are of unsupported type
     Started: 15:32:34.795869

```
Seems like, while the **where_args** parameter is optional, if absent the state is failing.

### Setup

```
vm-del-dns-{{ name }}:
  sqlite3.row_absent:
    - db: /var/lib/powerdns/pdns.sqlite3
    - table: records
    - where_sql: "name='{{ name }}' and type='A'"
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
**I have a fix that I will post as a PR.**

The steps to reproduce are pretty straight forwards.
1. having a sqlite3 db with a table
2. trying this state : 
```
test:
  sqlite3.row_absent:
    - db: /path/mydb.sqlite3
    - table: mytable
    - where_sql: "mycolumn='whatever'"
```
