PHP composer no longer writes any output to stdout.

Salt's composer.install module only returns the stdout to composer.installed state, which then inspects stdout to see if it is non-empty.

Only on non-empty output does the composer.installed state think that composer succeeded.

And thus now composer.installed always reports that it has failed, even when it has not.

The fix: The composer.installed state should not care what kind of output (or lack thereof) it gets back from composer.  Ignore the output.  Composer will exit non-zero and an exception will be thrown by the composer.install module if that happens.
