After upgrading from 2014.1.13 to 2014.7.0, new instances created with `salt-cloud` have an empty config file `/etc/salt/minion`. Nothing about my salt cloud config files has changed.

This is when using mapfiles as well as when creating single instances on the command line. The command finishes successfully and Salt is, indeed, bootstrapped onto the instance. But with no minion config, the minion takes all the defaults and never connects to my salt master (as well as no custom grains, etc...).

This is on a CentOS 6.5 machine.

```
# /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/openstack.conf

  minion:
    master: 10.10.10.10

  display_ssh_output: False

  script: /path/to/custom/script.sh
```

```
