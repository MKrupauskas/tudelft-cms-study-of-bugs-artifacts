### Description of Issue/Question

Using the salt command "locate.locate" always throws the following exception:
`suse:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/minion.py", line 1071, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/locate.py", line 112, in locate
        options += toggles[option]
    KeyError: '__pub_user'
`
### Setup

Tested with version 2015.8.7, but it seems that it is still happening.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Execute the following command:
`salt '*' locate.locate something`
I tried to solve it, and it seems that with this diff it works:

```
110,113c110,112
<     for option in toggles:
<         if option in kwargs:
<             if bool(kwargs[option]) is True:
<                 options += toggles[option]

>         if bool(kwargs[option]) is True:
>             options += toggles[option]
```
