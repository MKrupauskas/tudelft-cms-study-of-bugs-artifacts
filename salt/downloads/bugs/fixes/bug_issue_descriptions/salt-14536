I'm using SaltStack on Windows minions and trying to use file.patch to patch some files (after manually installing a patch.exe binary for it to use).

The files are under "Program Files" and that space in the path causes the patch command to fail with the error "extra operand". Hopefully just a case of changing salt/modules/file.py, line 1454, from:
`cmd = 'patch {0}{1} {2} {3}'.format(`
to:
`cmd = 'patch {0}{1} "{2}" "{3}"'.format(`
