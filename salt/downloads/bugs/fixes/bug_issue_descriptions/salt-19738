`salt-call 2014.7.0 (Helium)`

e.g. from your docu:

```
server1:
  host.present:
    - ip: 192.168.0.42
    - names:
      - server1
      - florida
```

creates the EOL direct without linebreak so that some services have problem reading this file (sorry forgotten which ones... I had this problem since 2014.1.7). 

My temporary fix for it:

```
/etc/hosts:
  file.append:
    - text: |
        ##
        ## end of hosts
```
