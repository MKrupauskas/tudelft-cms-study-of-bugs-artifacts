Hi,

We upgraded a Salt structure from version 3000.3 to 3002.1;

In my configuration file, the fileserver_backend option was enabled.

"file_recv: True

fileserver_backend:
 - minionfs
 - roots

minionfs_mountpoint: salt: // minionfs "

After upgrading, I am experiencing the following error messages.

"2020-11-12 09: 54: 17,664 [salt.loader: 1992] [ERROR] [217520] Failed to load function minionfs.envs because its module (minionfs) is not in the whitelist: ['minion', 'roots '] "

Following the documentation (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/minionfs.html), the simple configuration should already work, but it presented the error.


I added some other parameters even to try to resolve this whitelist issue
"file_recv: True
minionfs_env: minionfs

fileserver_backend:
 - minionfs
 - roots

minionfs_whitelist: minionfs

minionfs_mountpoint: salt: // minionfs "

However the error continues, what parameter is missing in this version (3002.1)?

[root @ master master.d] # salt-run test.get_opts | grep minionfs
[ERROR] The appoptics_return module couldn't load the appoptics_metrics module.
[ERROR] please make sure it is installed and is in the PYTHON_PATH.
    - minionfs
minionfs_blacklist:
minionfs_env:
    minionfs
minionfs_mountpoint:
    salt: // minionfs
minionfs_update_interval:
minionfs_whitelist:
