It is possible to include a `.sls` file in (at least) two ways currently:

```
include
  - other.file
  - other/file
```

However, if the same file is included two different ways somewhere in the state config, one gets an error saying that state names need to be unique. Normalizing the names of include files when they are read in would solve this problem.
