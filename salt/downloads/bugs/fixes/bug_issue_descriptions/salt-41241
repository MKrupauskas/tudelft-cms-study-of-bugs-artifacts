### Description of Issue/Question
If we do not specify minion id in the minion configuration file explicitly, salt will try to come up with one and usually should take the hostname. However, if the hostname starts with 127 - it ignores it.

We believe this is caused by incorrect filter expression in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2016.11/salt/utils/network.py#L98

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
root@127foo:/# hostname
127foo
root@127foo:/# salt-call -l debug test.ping
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion
[DEBUG   ] Including configuration from '/etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf'
[DEBUG   ] Reading configuration from /etc/salt/minion.d/_schedule.conf
[DEBUG   ] Guessing ID. The id can be explicitly set in /etc/salt/minion
[WARNING ] Cannot resolve address None info via socket: <class 'socket.gaierror'>
[DEBUG   ] Found minion id from generate_minion_id(): 172.18.0.4
...
root@127foo:/# cat /etc/salt/minion_id
172.18.0.4
```
