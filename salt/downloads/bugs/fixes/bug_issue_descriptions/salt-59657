**Description**

Since the fix for CVE-2021-3197 (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/5273722c2180c394bc426f731450b95809ca952e) it's no longer possible to use a custom roster in kwargs of a command (it's only possible with opts).

**Setup**

Nothing specific just a different roster than the one defined in the config.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Just run an ssh command from the salt-master using a roster different from the one in the config (default: flat)

```
salt-run salt.cmd saltutil.cmd 'my-minion' test.ping ssh=true roster=my_roster -l debug
[...]
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded flat.targets
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded jinja.render
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded yaml.render
[DEBUG   ] compile template: /etc/salt/roster
[...]
[ERROR   ] No matching targets found in roster.
```

**Expected behavior**

Using the right roster module.

NOTE: it works well in 3002.2 (and older versions)
