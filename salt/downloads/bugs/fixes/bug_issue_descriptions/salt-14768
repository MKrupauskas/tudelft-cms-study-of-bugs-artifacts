Accessing the master through client.LocalClient fails even when the user is in the ACL list, but only on RPM systems

The root of the problem is that /var/cache/salt is created by the Debian packaging (as mode 0755), but is not created by the RPM packaging, and the master running as root creates the dirs as 770.

I'm not sure of the correct fix, but it seems like individual files in /var/cache/salt are carefully permission-managed, so perhaps the right answer is to add /var/cache/salt to the RPM packaging?
