### Description of Issue/Question

Unable to run orchetration using salt-run command with non root user despite external_auth configured and working for function/state.
Execution work as root but not with regular user.
I am very new to salt and it might be a configuration/usage issue but I have made nothing else than told in documentation.

### Setup

Single master executed as root
GitFs backend file server for salt files and ext_pillar.
No publisher_acl configured

/orch/orch_test.sls :
```yaml
orch_test:
  salt.function:
    - name: test.ping
    - tgt: '*'
```

/etc/salt/master :
```ini
...
# The external auth system uses the Salt auth modules to authenticate and
# validate users to access areas of the Salt system.
external_auth:
  pam:
    testuser:
      - '@runner'
      - '@wheel'
      - '.*'
...
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Executing as a root user giving credential for testuser :

```shell
[root@host ~]# salt-run -c /etc/salt/ -a pam state.orchestrate orch.orch_test saltenv=dev
username: testuser
password:
host.domain:
----------
          ID: orch_test
    Function: salt.function
        Name: test.ping
      Result: True
     Comment: Function ran successfully. Function test.ping ran on minion1, minion2.
     Started: 16:40:04.552420
    Duration: 4287.817 ms
     Changes:
              minion1:
                  True
              minion2:
                  True

Summary for host.domain
------------

Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
Total run time:   4.288 s
retcode:
    0
```

Executing salt-run as the user :

```shell
[testuser@host bin]$ salt-run -c /etc/salt/ -a pam state.orchestrate orch.orch_test saltenv=dev -l trace

```

No log on the master even running as -l trace

For information it works with function/state :

```shell
testuser@host` bin]$ salt '*' -c /etc/salt/ -a pam test.ping -l debug
