### Description of Issue/Question

The way `network.routes` works on Debian/Ubuntu is by installing a script in `/etc/network/if-up.d`. The scripts on this folder will, however, get executed everytime an interface comes up. The first time the routes will get installed but the following will result in errors.

Expected behaviour would be that the routes that get installed with, e.g. interface ens160, are not run when e.g. ens192 or lo0 are being started.
### Setup

```
test-routes:
  network.routes:
    - name: ens160
    - routes:
      - ipaddr: 10.2.0.0
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        gateway: 10.1.0.3
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
