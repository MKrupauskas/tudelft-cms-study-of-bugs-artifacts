### Description of Issue/Question
addrs will contains "127.0.0.1" after this line 579
"addrs.update(set(salt.utils.network.ip_addrs(include_loopback=include_localhost)))"

"127.0.0.1" exists in "grains.get('ipv4', [])"
"if ipv4 == '127.0.0.1' and not include_localhost:" can not filter "127.0.0.1" when include_localhost is True. That cause any ids found in master's cache added to the result set.

In addition, salt/runners/manage.py -> line 205, list_state function uses 'include_localhost=True' to call connected_ids. 

This bug will cause stopped minion shown in result of manage.present

version: v2016.11.0
