Hi,

I have the following config on a system where I have already a network interface configured, but with different options ... ( That means, salt would change the interface for the case when test is not set)

```
eth0:
  network.managed:
    - test: True
    - enabled: True
    - type: eth
    - proto: none
    - bridge: br0
```

If I run now a state.highstate, then I get the following output...

```
----------
          ID: eth0
    Function: network.managed
      Result: None
     Comment: Interface eth0 is set to be updated.

Summary
--------------

Failed:      0
--------------
Total states run:     1
```

That means, the same state has been reported as unchanged and changed at the same time which I would consider as faulty behavior?
My guess is that the final summary is calculated by collecting all changes without checking the result for `None` which would indicate a state under test.

Can you confirm that this is a bug, so I might have a look at it.

Cheers,
