**Version: 2014.7.0rc5**

When using compound matching, mine.get returns every server.
`sudo salt '*dev-appnode*' mine.get 'G@environment:dev and G@roles:redis' network.interfaces compound`

When using grain matching, no server is returned.
`sudo salt '*dev-appnode*' mine.get 'roles:redis' network.interfaces grain`

When using either the compound or grain server with test.ping the right number of servers is returned.
