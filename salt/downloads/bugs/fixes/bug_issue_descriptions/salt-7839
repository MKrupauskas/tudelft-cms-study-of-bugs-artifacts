Some of my machines are incorrectly labelled as Xen PV DomU. A dmesg on 'xen' is too unstable. My servers match on:

```
[    2.184425] serial8250: skipping TxEn test for device [8086:108f] subsystem [8086:0000]
```

However, this is not 100% safe. One of my xen Dom0's has its dmesg queue filled up, and dmesg |grep -i xen doesn't yield anything. This is a 'plague' in my Dom0's, because the xen-create-image scripts add some deprecated iptables rule, and dmesg is filled with:

```
[7894628.107651] physdev match: using --physdev-out in the OUTPUT, FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains for non-bridged traffic is not supported anymore.
```

This is not an issue on a DomU, but the dmesg queue can still fill up, of course.
