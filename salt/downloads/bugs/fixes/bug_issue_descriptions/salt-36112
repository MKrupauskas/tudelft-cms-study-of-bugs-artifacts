### Description of Issue/Question

Since Python 2.7.12 (not sure : I haven't found the bug report), it seems that `pwd.getpwnam` doesn't read the `/etc/master.passwd` file anymore on OpenBSD 6.0. Which is the correct behavior I think : `pwd` module for `/etc/passwd` and `spwd` module for `/etc/master.passwd`.

As a result, the `shadow` module password test fails and Salt tries to update the passwd at each runs. The side-effect is the state 'user.present' always returns a `False`.
### Setup
- OpenBSD 6.0
- salt-2016.3.1p1 (OpenBSD package)
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
# salt-call shadow.info username
local:
    ----------
    change:
        0
    expire:
        0
    name:
        username
    passwd:
        * <--- THIS IS THE PROBLEM
```
