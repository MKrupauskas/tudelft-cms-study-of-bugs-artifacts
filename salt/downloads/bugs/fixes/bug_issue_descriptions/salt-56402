### Description of Issue
This is a followup to https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/51879

The original problem was fixed in that issue, however, a new issue is now happening that wasn't caught before because it wasn't getting to the file creation part. 

Now if the file exists and you use test=true to see if it wants to change the file on linux it will throw the following error.

```
salt sse\* state.apply test.test test=true
sse.wolfnet.bad4.us:
----------
          ID: /tmp/foo
    Function: file.managed
      Result: False

Under windows, I get a different issue, which states that the file wants to replace a text file with a binary file. no matter what kind of file is in place. 

### Setup
The setup is the same as before with the instructions in 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/46934
Once setup, run the `file.managed` once. then run it again with test=true. 

For further testing replace the /tmp/foo file with a text file. The error should continue to happen with `test=true`

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Setup as above, run the state once, then run the state with test
