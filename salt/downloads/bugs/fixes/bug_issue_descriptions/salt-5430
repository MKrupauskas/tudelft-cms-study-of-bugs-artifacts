I've just upgraded all of my minions along with the master to salt 0.15.3 (debian packages from http://debian.saltstack.com/debian wheezy-saltstack) and since then there's no way any minion could see any matching sls:

```
root@xizor:/home/imil# salt 'blacksun' state.highstate
blacksun:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'blacksun' in env 'base'
```

```
# salt-call --local state.show_highstate
[...]
[INFO    ] Loading fresh modules for state activity
(nothing shown after that)
```

The top.sls file looks like this:

```
base:                                                                           
  '*':                                                                          
    - common                                                                    
    {% if 'roles' in grains %}                                              
    {% for role in grains['roles'] %}                                       
    - {{ role }}                                                                
    {% endfor %}                                                                
    {% endif %}                                                                 

  'virtual_subtype:Xen PV DomU':                                                
    - match: grain                                                              
    - domus                                                                     

  {{ grains['host'] }}:                                                         
    - {{ grains['host'] }}
```

I obviously restarted the minions and the master, emptied the caches, nothing worked.

I then downgraded to 0.15.1, and everything worked again.
