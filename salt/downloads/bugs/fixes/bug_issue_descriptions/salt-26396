I'm trying to use `#!yamlex` and `!aggregate` in some of my pillar files. As I understand the [documentation](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#pillar-source-merging-strategy) of `pillar_source_merging_strategy`, the default 'smart' strategy should then switch to the aggregate when it finds a yamlex renderer. However, it doesn't. If I set the merge strategy to aggregate in the master config, it does work.

I've created files like this:

```
pillar/top.sls
'test-node':
  - merging.testbase
  - merging.test1
  - merging.test2
```

```
pillar/merging/testbase.sls
#!yamlex
foo: !aggregate baz
foo: !aggregate base
```

```
pillar/merging/test1.sls
#!yamlex
foo: !aggregate bar
```

```
pillar/merging/test2.sls
#!yamlex
foo: !aggregate qux
```

```
# salt-call --local pillar.items foo
local:
    ----------
    foo:
        - qux
```

Am I misunderstanding the documentation when I think that the smart strategy should switch to aggregate here, or is this a bug?
