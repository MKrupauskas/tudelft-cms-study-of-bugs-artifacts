Hi!
I already reported the same bug in #57794 but seems it is introduced again.
The same. When one minion is running when I start it again it exits with:
```
18:11:20 [INFO    ] salt.cli.daemons:293 Setting up the Salt Minion "90520736270401"
18:11:20 [INFO    ] salt.cli.daemons:88 An instance is already running. Exiting the Salt Minion
18:11:20 [INFO    ] salt.cli.daemons:88 Shutting down the Salt Minion
```
And it removes the pid file. So when I start minion for the 3-rd time  it starts and I have 2 minions running.
