**Description**
`sd.get` has an optional parameter `strict` which defaults to `False`. This feature was added last year here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/57630

The documentation says ` If the uri provided is not valid, then it will be returned as-is, unless strict=True was passed.` but it does not say what it will return. In my case the error returned is:

`ERROR executing 'sdb.get': SDB profile "vault" wasnt found in the minion configuration` when running:

But the error message is misleading as the profile "vault" was found, does exist and the minion configuration is correct, it just doesn't have the value `some-system:password` set in it. That is what the error message should say.

So why is a bit of vague documentation and an inaccurate error message a problem? I spent ages trying to diagnose what was wrong with my vault configuration until I realised it was nothing to do with that and was purely a missing key/value. The fix should just be an improvement to the documentation and error messages.

**Setup**
Vault config:
```
vault:
  driver: yaml
  files:
    - /etc/salt/vault/vault.yaml
```
Vault file:
```
some-system:
  user: blahblahblah
```
CLI call to sdb:
```
 salt 'minion' sdb.get sdb://vault/some-system:password strict=True
```
