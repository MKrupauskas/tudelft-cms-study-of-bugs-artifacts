When we try to create a vm with salt-cloud the DVS connection fails if 2 datacenters defined with distributed switches which are using the same portgroup names in both datacenters. The object search queries the portgroups by their name and this returns only one portgroup id every time which might not be the one which we actually need. 
This can be fixed by starting the object search from the datacenter object where the vm will be created, rather than from the rootFolder. I would like to ask @rallytime and @nmadhok, do you think this is a sufficient solution?
