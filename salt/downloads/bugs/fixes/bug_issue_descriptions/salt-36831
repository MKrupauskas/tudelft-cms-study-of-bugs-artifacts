### Description of Issue/Question

I have a state for a readthedocs server.  One stanza is:

```
setup-directories-for-readthedocs:
  file.directory:
    - name: /opt/app/readthedocs.org
    - user: apache
    - group: apache
    - recurse:
      - user
      - group
```

The issue is that the service (e.g. during a documentation build) creates temporary directories and files in that directory tree and then deletes them.  If a file/directory is deleted during the execution of this state it can cause an exception to be thrown.  Looks like the issue is a scan is done to list the contents of the directory tree and then the permissions are changed so if a temporary file exists when it is scanned but is deleted before the state starts to change permissions you get an exception.

```
                An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1624, in call
    **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1492, in wrapper
    return f(*args, **kwargs)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/states/file.py", line 2093, in directory
    follow_symlinks)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/file.py", line 3637, in check_perms
    raise CommandExecutionError('{0} does not exist'.format(name))
CommandExecutionError: /opt/app/readthedocs.org/user_builds/release-tools/artifacts/latest/mkdocs/assembly does not exist
```

By its nature this is an intermittent occurrence as the timing has to be just right.  `file.directory` should not assert/fail on this condition.
