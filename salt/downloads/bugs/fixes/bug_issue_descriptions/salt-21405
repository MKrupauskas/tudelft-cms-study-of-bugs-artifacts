Minions report the following error:

```
2015-03-07 16:48:36,658 [salt.utils.schedule][INFO    ][3132] Invalid function: status.master in job __master_alive. Ignoring.
```

This causes the minion to never check to see if the master is still there, despite master_alive_interval being set in the minion config.  This works with 2015.2rc1 on Linux, but 2015.2rc is not available on Windows yet.  This despite the minion loosing its TCP connection to the master, as evidenced by netstat -a on the minion.
