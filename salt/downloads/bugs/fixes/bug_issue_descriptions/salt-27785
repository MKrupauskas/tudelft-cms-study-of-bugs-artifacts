clamav/init.sls:

```
clamav-daemon:
  pkg:
    - latest
    - require:
      - cmd: apt_sources
      - pkg: clamav-freshclam
  file:
    - managed
    - name: /etc/clamav/clamd.conf
    - source: salt://clamav/clamd.jinja2

amavis/clamav/init.sls:

```
include:
  - clamav

extend:
  clamav:
    user:
      - groups:
        - amavis
      - require:
        - pkg: clamav-daemon
        - pkg: amavis
      - watch_in:
        - blah: clamav-daemon
```

Running `state.sls amavis.clamav` still passed although `blah: clamav-daemon` does not exist.
The reason is it just check the ID `clamav-daemon` and only throw an error when that ID does not exist:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Cannot extend ID 't' in 'base:clamav'. It is not part of the high state.
This is likely due to a missing include statement or an incorrectly typed ID.
Ensure that a state with an ID of 't' is available
in environment 'base' and to SLS 'clamav'
```

You can specify `whatever: clamav-daemon` in this case and it does not failed.
