According to `salt-key -h`, `salt-key -L` is deprecated in favor of `salt-key --list all`, however all variation of this (`-lall`, `-l all`, `--list all`) fail with the same error:

``` bash
salt-key: error: 'all' is not a valid argument to '--list'
```

I also found no reference to `-L` being deprecated in the code (under salt/key.py), and there's nothing implemented for handling `all` in list_status. I was also unable to find any examples of `--list all` in the documentation, but `-L` is used quite frequently.
