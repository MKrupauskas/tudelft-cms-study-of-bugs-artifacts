I have a small autosigner script:

```
#!/bin/sh
salt-key --list un | sed 1d | while read line; do
        if [ $(ldapsearch -LLL -x cn=`echo $line | cut -d . -f 1` dn 2>/dev/null | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l) -eq 1 ]
        then
                echo Accepting $line
                salt-key -q -y -a $line > /dev/null 2>&1
        else
                echo Removing $line
                salt-key -q -y -d $line > /dev/null 2>&1
        fi
done
```

However, running this breaks communication with established minions. If running a `salt-call`, it throws an `AuthenticationError`. It also requires all minions to re-connect. For example, running `salt \* test.ping` immediately after the autosign script will not match anything.

I haven't seen/missed any documentation that states this is desired behavior.
