### Description of Issue/Question
From the [docs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/runners/all/salt.runners.manage.html#salt.runners.manage.alived):
"show_ipv4: Also show the IP address each minion is connecting from."

But this is what I get when testing in two completely different environments:

```
$ sudo salt-call saltutil.runner manage.list_state show_ipv4=True
local:
    ----------
    minion0:
        127.0.0.1
    minion1:
        127.0.0.1
    minion2:
        127.0.0.1
...etc.
```
These are all different machines - some physical, some virtual. The IP returned should not be the loopback IP.

Executing the command more directly via `salt-run` (ie. `sudo salt-run manage.list_state show_ipv4=True`) makes no difference.

On one network I have almost 30 hosts connected but only 3 have the correct IP address provided. Any host with a direct connection to the master (ie. same subnet) returns 127.0.0.1, but there's more to it than that. I have one host from a routed source (the same subnet as other hosts that do return the correct IP) but it too returns 127.0.0.1. The only difference is that it has an OpenVPN interface online (which is not used and cannot be used for reaching the master anyway).

Basically I want to get the IP address of each connected host on the master for injecting into pillar data for a particular Icinga host, without having to resort to having each host add its IP address to the mine. I thought this would be an easy and efficient approach.

### Setup
I added `presence_events: True` to my master configuration, but it didn't make any difference.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
N/A

### Versions Report
