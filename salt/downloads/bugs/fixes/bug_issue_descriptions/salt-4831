salt version: 0.14.1
salt -v doesn't report downed minion consistently.

salt -v '*' test.ping  : reports downed minion with 'Minion did not return' message correctly.

While invocations like below won't report downed minion at all.
salt -I 'roles:Myrole' test.ping
salt -G 'os_family=RedHat' test.ping
and other variations like there.

It would be a nice feature to report downed minion consistently with salt -v option (or may be an additional command line option salt --down-report ) this would be very helpful when pushing states to large number of minions and knowing if any minion is missed in that cycle.
