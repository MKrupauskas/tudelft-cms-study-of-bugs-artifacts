I have a minion connecting to a master via Internet, the routing between these 2 servers is bit unstable, e.g. there is some packet loss, however many other services are running fine, just salt is having bigger problems. 

one server is in Azure Cloud and they dont allow ICMP, so here is a tcpping to give an idea of the packet loss encountered:

```
root@minion1:~# ./tcpping salt-master.example.com 4506
seq 0: tcp response from salt-master.example.com (1.1.1.1) [open]  310.518 ms

seq 16: tcp response from salt-master.example.com (1.1.1.1) [open]  313.983 ms
seq 14: no response (timeout)
seq 17: tcp response from salt-master.example.com (1.1.1.1) [open]  310.181 ms
seq 19: tcp response from salt-master.example.com (1.1.1.1) [open]  312.813 ms
```

here is "salt-minion -l debug", trying "salt minion1 test.ping" from the master only works about 1 out of 10 times, just wondering if the errors below are normal in this situation of a not 100% stable connection and also if its normal to expect salt to work this badly over this kind of connection (pretty much unusable, whereas other services are working fine even though there is some packet loss)

```

I experience similar kind of problems with other minions, all are connecting via Internet to the master. You could argue that the connection in the above example is not good, but over WAN connecting multiple clouds and many servers its just expected to have a few of those not ideal connections, other services between those servers (mostly HTTP/HTTPS based etc) run fine, is it normal that ZMQ is this sensitive to packet loss, given that other services are able to recover without problems but with ZMQ I always seem to have minions loosing their connection to the master. 

I wanted to try RAET, but it has been broken for a few releases now already, I tried following the RAET bugs and the patches there but could never get it to work sadly.
