The caching mechanism implemented in the module can't work in versions 2015.5.x and 2015.8.x. Basically, it tries to compare md5 check-sum of a  locally cached file with check-sum extracted from S3 bucket meta-data file.

The problem is in `_get_file_from_s3` function where it tries to compare two variables but of different types. Variable `file_md5` is a `list` while variable `cached_md5` is a `string`.
