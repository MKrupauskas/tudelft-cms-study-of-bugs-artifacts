network.managed has an option per bridge to bypass firewall.
On Linux however, it sets the sysctl vars
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables 

which apply to _ALL_ bridges.
Either it should be under network.system, or we should do some table fu to bypass the firewall when requested
