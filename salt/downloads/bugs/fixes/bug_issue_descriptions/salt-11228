(Same symptoms as #1305, but I can't re-open that, and also that specific issue is supposed to be fixed so maybe this is different under the hood?)

```
# salt-call cmd.run '/etc/init.d/couchdb restart'
[INFO    ] The `dmidecode` binary is not available on the system. GPU grains will not be available.
[INFO    ] Executing command '/etc/init.d/couchdb restart' in directory '/root'
... does nothing for ages ...
^C
```

running that command from the shell works ok. All other services restart fine, it's just the couchdb init script specifically that is somehow different.

Using 2014.1.0 on CentOS 6.5
