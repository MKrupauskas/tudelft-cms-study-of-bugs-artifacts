Hello,

Since last "fix" from https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/6303, a new issue arises.

```
ze@zetest-32:~$ uname -a
Linux zetest-32 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.2.32-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux
ze@zetest-32:~$ dpkg --print-architecture
i386

Arch: amd64 / x86_64
OS: i386
```

`apt.list_pkgs` shows all packages with an `:i386` suffix, thought it's the default architecture for packages.

`pkg.install` state "fails" as it can't find it in the newly installed packages (but is correctly installed).

Removing a package fails as it can't find it to start with.

Responsible code:

``` python
# file: salt/modules/apt.py - lines 538-540

        if __grains__.get('cpuarch', '') == 'x86_64' \
                and re.match(r'i\d86', arch):
            name += ':{0}'.format(arch)
```

It mislead the module into thinking that a x86_64 CPU means i386 is not the default architecture.

Guess it should try to check with something like `dpkg --print-architecture`, but not sure what would the properway to do it. (calling each time, grain, cache, ...)

Any suggestion on a proper way to fix it ?

(adding `:i386` to the package would work, but would also require the state file to be aware of the host arch)
