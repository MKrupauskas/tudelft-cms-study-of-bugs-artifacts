I'm getting hung up on https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/svn.py#L200-L204

Essentially I want to grab a file from svn no matter what, even if the file/dir exists. I thought using force would allow me to do this, but it looks like I would have to use a cmd.run to remove the file so this doesn't fail.

Is this a bug? Or is my use case just different than intended?
I'd like to be able to override this check some how. What do you think?
