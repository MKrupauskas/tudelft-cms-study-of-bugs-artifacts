### Description of Issue/Question

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
I have the following SLS

```
/etc/default/xyz:
  file.directory:
  - follow_symlinks: False
  - makedirs: True
  - force: True
```

Currently, /etc/default/xyz is a dangling symlink

```
root@abc:/etc/default# ls -l xyz
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Feb 14 12:01 xyz -> /doesnt/exist
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)

Expected behaviour: I've told salt that I want /etc/default/xyz to be a directory. I expect it to remove the old symlink if present, particularly when I've set force: True and follow_symlinks: False

I shouldn't have to invent cumbersome code to check if it's a symlink and if so, remove that, first.
