### Description of Issue/Question
I am working on an orchestration that will get an IP from an IPAM system, initiate vm creation in vmware, and if the vm creation fails, the IP address is released.

However, if there is a problem during the creation of the VM, the Error is being reported under "Changes" and the "Result" is incorrectly reported as "True".  This is breaking the "onfail" requisite.

### Output
```
         ID: provision_vm
    Function: salt.runner
        Name: cloud.create
      Result: True
     Comment: Runner function 'cloud.create' executed.
