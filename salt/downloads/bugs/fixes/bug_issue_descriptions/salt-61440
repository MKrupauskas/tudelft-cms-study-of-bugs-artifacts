**Description**
Logic omission found in newly merged code #61391 

> Does this account for header case? The standard is `ETag` but I'd expect it to be normalised to `etag`, not `Etag`.

**Expected behavior**
apache2 and `http.server` use `Etag`, while nginx uses `ETag`. Current logic would only work on the former. We shouldn't care either way.
