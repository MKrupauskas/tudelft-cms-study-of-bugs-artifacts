boto_vpc.get_subnet_assocation returns a dict with the key of vpc_id, boto_elb retreives the vpc_id of the subnets using boto_vpc.get_subnet_association, but attempts to pass the dict in later function calls in the function instead of the vpc_id value

Fixed in #27541 

If desired, I can split out the updates in this commit, I forgot that I had to make this correction in the state file when testing my other boto_elb updates.
