I currently have a work around for the problem by adding

```
/etc/sysctl.d/99-salt.conf:
  file.touch
```

In this instance I think it would be in the modules best interest to ensure the file it is trying to access already exists. I have looked at the code in the develop branch and it appears as though the issue still exists. _I have not run the above state against the develop branch._

I am not very strong with Python, but I am happy to give a fix a crack and submit a pull request if it would help.

Cheers,

Jon
