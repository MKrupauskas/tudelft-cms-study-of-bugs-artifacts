### Description of Issue/Question

Since upgrading to 2016.3.0 **grains** dictionary is empty in external pillar config
### Setup

We have an external pillar config file that requires the fqdn of the minion making the pillar call.
The fqdn is collected from the  `__grains__` dictonary, but in 2016.3.0 this dictionary seems to be empty.
In the external pillar config this line now fails:
`host: {{ fqdn }}`
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

The _users_ state that uses the external pillar now fails because the fqdn is empty and the state fails with this error:

```
# salt myminion state.sls users
myminion:
Data failed to compile: 
----------
Pillar failed to render with the following messages: 
----------
Failed to load ext_pillar pillar_ldap: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects
```

Note:
The 'NoneType' is because of the empty host {{ fqdn }}
