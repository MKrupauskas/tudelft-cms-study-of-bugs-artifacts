In some brief testing with a package that REQUIRES one or more `--params` the debug logs are showing that it never receives the args passed in via `- package_args: 'serverurl=http://localhost:8111'` in my sls file. Tested that by calling `chocolatey.install package package_args='serverurl=http://localhost:8111'` from a salt-call it does work.

### Setup
Running the teamcityagent.sls state with a package_params set to a sane default when the pillar isn't present results in a failure because the parameters are never passed to the install command.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Here is an appveyor run of the state showing that it never even appears to try passing the additional arguments.

Here is appveyor running via the chocolatey.install module instead and correctly picking up the package_args.
