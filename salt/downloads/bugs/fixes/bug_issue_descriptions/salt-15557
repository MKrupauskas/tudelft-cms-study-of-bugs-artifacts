Setup:

Minions running: salt-minion 2014.1.10 (Hydrogen)
Master running: salt-master 2014.1.10 (Hydrogen)

OS: Debian Jessie

Master config:

```
# Allow salt to execute anything
client_acl:
  salt:
    - .*
    - test.ping

file_roots:
  base:
    - /home/salt/src/config/states

pillar_roots:

The master is running as root, and root can send commands:

The salt user cannot use salt to send commands, and reports:
 "Failed to connect to the Master, is the Salt Master running?"
