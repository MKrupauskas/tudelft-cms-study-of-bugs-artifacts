This is my first time posting here, so please forgive me if I don't include something I should.

Whenever I try to change the IP address of my Windows minion running v2014.7.5, I get this error:

``` python
 The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\minion.py", line 1020, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\win_ip.py", line 262, in set_static_ip
        if not salt.utils.validate.net.ipv4_addr(addr):
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\utils\validate\net.py", line 67, in ipv4_addr
        return __ip_addr(addr, socket.AF_INET)
      File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\utils\validate\net.py", line 46, in __ip_addr
        socket.inet_pton(address_family, ip)
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'inet_pton'
```

I can recreate this error when I try to change the IP via network.managed in a state, or ip.set_static_ip in the command line, and both using salt-call and salt 'WindowsMinion'. 

The expected outcome should be that the IP address is set to static and will get changed to the value I input. I can successfully change the IP to DCHP via states and modules. On IRC chat, I was told that restarting WMI would fix the issue, but after restarting WMI (and also the whole machine), the issue was still there.

Both of these methods worked with minions on v2014.7.2, and rolling my windows minion back to v2014.7.2 removed the error and the IP address is changed. I have tried across multiple Windows OSes (Server 2012 R2, Server 2008, and Windows 7) and none of them work with v2014.7.5. I am using Virtual Machines created with vSphere as my minions and using the v2014.7.5 installer from http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/windows.html
