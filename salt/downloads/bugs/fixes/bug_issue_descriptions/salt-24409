I'm getting intermittent errors with `git` state related to using tags and the most recent ones is this:

```

Where `v0.1.0` is a tag in the remote git repository (not a branch). The state definition is as follows:

```
{{ sls_base_name }}-deploy:
  git.latest:
    - name: {{ adminserver.app_git_url }}
    - rev: {{ adminserver.app_version }}
    - target: {{ adminserver.user_home }}/{{ adminserver.app_dir_basename }}
    - identity: {{ adminserver.user_home }}/.ssh/{{ adminserver.ssh_key_name }}.pem
    - user: {{ adminserver.user_name }}
    - force_checkout: True
    - require:
      - pkg: {{ sls_base_name }}-install-pkgs
      - file: {{ sls_base_name }}-ssh-key
```

Also this may or may not be important. The original version of this checkout was `master` and then it was replaced with a specific tag, so `git.latest` is executed in the directory with pre-existing checkout.
