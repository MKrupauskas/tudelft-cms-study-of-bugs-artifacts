`net [something]` utilities are localized, so some should not rely on english magic labels for parsing its output data.

I don't know if the output layout is fix or not, or if there are optional rows. If it's a fix layout, then a it is trivial to fix it. However, using api directly would be even better. Maybe using ADSI, but I don't know, if it is exposed to python in some convenient way.
