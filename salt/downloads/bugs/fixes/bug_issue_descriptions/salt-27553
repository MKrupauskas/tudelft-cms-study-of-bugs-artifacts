If I go through the process on page: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/quickstart.html and use the bootstrap script I wind up with an older version of SaltStack, 2015.5.2.

I have to install directly from the repo to get the current release, 2015.8.0. 

I'm installing on CentOS 6.6
