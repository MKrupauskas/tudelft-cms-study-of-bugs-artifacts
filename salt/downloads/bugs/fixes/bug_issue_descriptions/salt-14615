WIth a state like:

``` YAML
johndoe:
    user.present:
        - password: {{ pillar['somepillar'] }}
```

the plain password will be shown in the changes of this state:

``` YAML
          ID: johndoe
    Function: user.present
      Result: True
     Comment: New user johndoe created
     Changes:   
              ----------
              active:
                  Yes
              comment:

              fullname:

              gid:

              groups:
                  - Users
              home:

              logonscript:

              name:
                  johndoe
              password:
                  passwordfrompillar
              profile:


```

This problem affects only Windows, where it isn't possible to use a password hash but a plain password is needed.

The password in the changes output should possibly replaced with something like `****`.
