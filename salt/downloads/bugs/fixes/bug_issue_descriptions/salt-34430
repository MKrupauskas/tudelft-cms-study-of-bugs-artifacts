This was first raised by https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/33529#issuecomment-229814737, this traceback was caused by doing a `distutils.version.LooseVersion()` on an empty string with a version of distutils which did not gracefully handle it. The string was empty because there was no upgrade available, so we never should have performed a version comparison.
