### Description of Issue
Running a reg.present state will always say something has changed even though it has not. 
This makes highstate monitoring impossible.
The state is repeatedly executed which should not be the case.
This only happens if the vdata is passed as a string (see below)

### Setup
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE:
  reg.present:
    - vname: MyTest
    - vtype: REG_DWORD
    - vdata: '00000001'
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
use the state above and execute it twice. it claims something has changed even if nothing has changed during the second run:
