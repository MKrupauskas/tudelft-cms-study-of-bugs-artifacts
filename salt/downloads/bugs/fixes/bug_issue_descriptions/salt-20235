The following seems to fail. I added the result of the lsblk command to the comment string. As you can see, it shows no FSTYPE.

```
      ID: /dev/data/ceph
Function: blockdev.formatted
  Result: False
 Comment: Failed to format /dev/data/ceph:['FSTYPE']
 Started: 03:55:56.704243
Duration: 182.067 ms

```

However, the filesystem is formatted and calling the same lsblk command will show the filesystem has indeed been formatted.
