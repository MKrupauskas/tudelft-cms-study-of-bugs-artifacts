Here is the command run: `salt Win2012 user.rename testuser01 testuser`

Here is the exception:

```
Win2012:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\minion.py", line 1173, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "C:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt\modules\win_useradd.py", line 459, in rename
        if post_info['name'] != current_info['name']:
    KeyError: 'name'
```

Tested on Win 2012 with Win salt minion versions 2015.3, 2015.5 and 2015.8rc3 all with the same result.

Workaround (but may not be optimal) would be to delete the user and re-add with updated username.
