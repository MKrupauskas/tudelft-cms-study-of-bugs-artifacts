Hi,

I'm trying to run salt minion as a non-superuser; in particular, the minion process and the user to run as are the same.  However, the minion fails when, for example, installing a new package.  

On line 120 of `modules/cmdmod.py`, `os.setgroups()` requires superuser permissions.  Commenting out that block allows the minion to run fine. The user I'm trying to run salt as definitely has sufficient permissions to install the package, since I can do it manually.  What can I do to work around this, short of actually running salt as root?

Thanks,
Patrick
