In `servers.base` I have some includes:

```
include:
  - zabbix.agent
  - firewall

....
```

When running a highstate, this results in:

```
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    No matching sls found for 'servers.base' in env 'base'
```

because the 'firewall' state does not exist. It claims it cannot find servers.base, but this does exist. If it is because of a missing entry it should either:
1) proceed without
2) exit with "Unable to include firewall in servers.base"
