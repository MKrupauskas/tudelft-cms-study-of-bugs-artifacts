### Description of Issue/Question

Other states that take source kwargs (e.g., file.managed) will look in the current environment for those files.  The selinux.module state looks in the base environment instead, which breaks state execution in multi-environment setups.

### Setup

https://github.com/irtnog/salt-states/tree/development/tomcat/pwm.sls
https://github.com/irtnog/salt-states/tree/development/tomcat/files/tomcat-mysql.te

Note that in my setup, I use the base environment solely for targeting.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1. Write an SELinux type enforcement module and corresponding SLS file that calls selinux.module (e.g., above), and save them to an environment other than base.

2. Run the SLS file in that environment (e.g., `salt-call state.apply tomcat.pwm saltenv=development`).

```
