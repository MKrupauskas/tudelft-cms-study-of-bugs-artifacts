I think this is linked to the new [saltify driver](http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/config.html#saltify)
I don't know why it gets activated when I am using my azure provider. However now my master does not connect to my minions. Here is the sanitized traceback:

```
[INFO    ] 0 attached to <vm_name> (aka <vm_name>)
[INFO    ] Rendering deploy script: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/deploy/bootstrap-salt.sh
[ERROR   ] Failed to create VM <vm_name>. Configuration value 'ssh_host' needs to be set

```

My profile:

```
azure-small:
  provider: azure-config
  image: '<my_image>'
  size: Small
  location: 'West Europe'
  ssh_username: <user>          <- I added that to counter a missing key
  ssh_password: <password>   <- I added that to counter a missing key
  username: <user>
  password: <password>
  slot: production
  media_link: '<media_link>'
```

My map file is a regular:

```
azure-small:
  - <vm_name>:
      port: 25                               <- I think it does not work with 22 either anyway
```

And my version

```
           Salt: 2015.2.0-78-g717655c
         Python: 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56)
         Jinja2: 2.7.3

   msgpack-pure: Not Installed
       pycrypto: 2.6.1
        libnacl: Not Installed
         PyYAML: 3.10
          ioflo: Not Installed
          PyZMQ: 14.4.1
           RAET: Not Installed
            ZMQ: 4.0.5

```

I think this got merged by mistake since the unit tests only check for the VM existing and the error does not stop the deployment.
