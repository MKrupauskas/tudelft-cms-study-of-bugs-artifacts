### Description of Issue/Question

When running `./salt-minion.bat -ldebug` on a windows minion in powershell when I attempt to kill the process with Ctrl + c It does not bring me down to another prompt and just hangs there.
### Setup
1. Install salt-minion on windows host. don't even need to attach it to a master can be a clean install
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. start the minion process by doing the following:
   - cd \salt
   - `./salt-minion.bat -ldebug`
2. Try selecting Ctrl + c and it will say the salt minion shutdown but you are never sent to a prompt to continue interacting with powershell. Here is the output:

```
[INFO    ] The Salt Minion is shut down
The salt minion is shutdown. Minion received a SIGINT. Exited.



```

And it just hangs there now matter how many times I select Ctrl + c. I have to close out the powershell prompt and open a new one.

On previous versions for example 2016.3.3 I would see the following:

```
[INFO    ] The Salt Minion is shut down
The salt minion is shutdown. Minion received a SIGINT. Exited. Terminate batch job (Y/N)?y
PS C:\salt> 
```
