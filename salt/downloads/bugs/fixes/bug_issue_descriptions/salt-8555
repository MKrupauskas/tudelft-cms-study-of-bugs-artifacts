I have a dozen different minions, one of them, is also my "salt master", or the machine that I run salt-ssh from. Let's call this machine 'alpha'. Alpha has a 'project' grain set with: `salt-ssh 'alpha' grains.append project apple`

My other minions have their own projects too, let's look at minon 'beta', which has the 'project' grain set with `salt-ssh 'beta' grains.append project banana`

If I do this: `salt-ssh '*' grains.get project` the output is this:

```
alpha:
  - apple
beta:
  - banana
…
```

So far, so good.

In my top.sls, I have something like this:

```
base:
  …
  {% for project in grains['project'] %}
  - hosts.{{ project }}
  {% endfor %}
  …
```

The idea is that minions which have the project 'apple' will run a sub-sls in /srv/salt/hosts/apple/init.sls, and there's another for banana.  This all works wonderfully with salt-master, but with salt-ssh, top.sls assumes the grain-value for alpha no matter what host it is processing.  So, essentially, all of my minions receive the hosts for the project assigned to alpha.

I can 'prove' this behavior by changing the 'project' grain for alpha to a new value, then all of my minions receive the hosts for that new project.
