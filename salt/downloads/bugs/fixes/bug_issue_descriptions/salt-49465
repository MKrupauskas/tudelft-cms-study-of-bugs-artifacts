### Description of Issue/Question
Virtual module 'service' behaving wrong on a Manjaro distro - but the issues do NOT seem to be particular to Manjaro.

Issues:

-  a) saltstack seem to not load one and **only** one service implementation module
-  b) has kind of wrong conditions for using the 'default' _service.py_ module

I'll propose a small change that would fix b) although tests should be run on the affected platforms.

### Setup
When trying to force the service module, I am adding a 'providers.conf' file in /etc/salt/minion.d/ :
```
providers:
   service: systemd

```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
On a Manjaro distro, freshly installed (KDE, 17.1.12), install 'salt' via pacman (`pacman -Su salt`)
Then run
`salt-call --local --refresh-grains-cache -l debug service.get_running`
You will get a list of running service. Among them, 'sddm' let's say.

Let's get the full list:
`salt-call --local --refresh-grains-cache -l debug service.get_all`
Surprise! List is empty.

Let's check if 'sddm' service is available:
`salt-call --local --refresh-grains-cache -l debug service.available sddm`
Result: False (!!)

Let's edit 'service.py' (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/modules/service.py) and rename function `get_available` to `get_available2` and run the command again.
Result: True (!!) 
So... service.py (using /etc/init.d/ files) gets **ALSO** loaded together with systemd.py one and functions are merged from both modules !?
This looks like a wrong implementation of the concept: I have one and only one service module implementation.
Or, unless by design, it is ok to maybe load multiple python modules for a single virtual service.

Renaming `service.py:get_all()` to `service.py:get_all2()` will also show good results for the _service.get_all_ salt-call command run.

If I add the providers.conf file and ensure it is listed in the debug output of salt-call run, things seem to work.

One suggested patch:

     if __grains__['kernel'] != 'Linux':
         return (False, 'Non Linux OSes are not supported')

```
The first condition change was added in the idea that distros based on some more general ones, will behave the same, so that's why I added the check on 'os_family'.
Note that 'Manjaro' is a derivative of 'Arch' distro, and it shows with os_family as 'Arch'.
This needs some tests, at least for Suse distro(s).

The second change would ensure that once _systemd_ use is detected then it would not use the current module. This is a more generic condition, until a proper fix for using a single service module implementation is done.
