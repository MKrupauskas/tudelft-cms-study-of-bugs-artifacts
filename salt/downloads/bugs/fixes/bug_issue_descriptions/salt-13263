Currently it is only possible to specify a renderer to render everything. In some instances, such as with the newly merged gpg renderer, the only option is the specify the renderers at the top of each file needing to use the renderer. If the master config has `renderer: jinja | yaml | gpg` the minion will always attempt to use the gpg renderer even though it has no ability to do so. This leads to an error as the dependencies are likely not present on the minion.
