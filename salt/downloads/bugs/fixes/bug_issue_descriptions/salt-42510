### Description of Issue/Question
I am trying to use the artifactory.downloaded module. The group_id for the item I need to download has a dot in it (formatted like com.company). It's being converted to a / when it's compiling the information into a URL, and this is causing it to try to access an incorrect URL. The URL actually has the dot there.

I've taken a look through the source code and I've found that in salt/modules/artifactory.py there is a function __get_group_id_subpath which replaces any dots in the provided group_id with slashes.

Is my artifactory just formatted poorly and should be changed? Is there an easy way around this problem?
