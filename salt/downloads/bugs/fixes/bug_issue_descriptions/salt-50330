### Description of Issue/Question
sysctl.persist module is broken in FreeBSD

### Setup
Just use the module and check /etc/sysctl.conf (All \n are removed).

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
```
root@01-fw:~ # salt-call --version
salt-call 2018.3.3 (Oxygen)
root@01-fw:~ # cat /etc/sysctl.conf
# $FreeBSD: releng/10.4/etc/sysctl.conf 112200 2003-03-13 18:43:50Z mux $
#
#  This file is read when going to multi-user and its contents piped thru
#  ``sysctl'' to adjust kernel values.  ``man 5 sysctl.conf'' for details.
#

# Uncomment this to prevent users from seeing information about processes that
# are being run under another UID.

```

### Versions Report
This works in v2017.7.5 but not in v2018.3.3

The problem is in line https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2018.3.3/salt/modules/freebsd_sysctl.py#L147 and was introduced by @garethgreenaway in #45581.

PS: Would be great to have some tests for FreeBSD since you are using Kitchen, we have experience with it with kitchen-vagrant.
