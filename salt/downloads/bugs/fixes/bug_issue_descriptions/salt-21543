Hi,
 the blockdev.tune module is broken with the following errors:
- module doesn't deal with options that use a boolean correctly, e.g., `read-only: True`
  -- this results in blockdev failing to set the options at all
- module doesn't report changes to read-write state of a device

A fix will follow

Some more details:

```
/dev/my_vg/lvroot:
  blockdev.tuned:
   - read-write: True
   - read-ahead: 1024
```

Error Message:

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'blockdev --setrw True --setra 1024 /dev/my_vg/lvroot' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] Command 'blockdev --setrw True --setra 1024 /dev/my_vg/lvroot' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] output: blockdev: cannot open True: No such file or directory
```
