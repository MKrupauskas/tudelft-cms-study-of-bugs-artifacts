Same issue as #14426 but for Archlinux. The packages contained in the group gets installed but salt can't know it because it check the packages with `pacman -Q` which return the list of installed package but not package groups.

The way to fix maybe to get the list of package within the group with `pacman -Sg <group>` and then checking if they are present in the list returned by `pacman -Q`.

**SLS:**

```
fprint:
  pkg.installed
```

**Result:**

```
[INFO    ] Executing command 'pacman -Q' in directory '/root'
[ERROR   ] The following packages failed to install/update: fprint.

It was run masterless with an up-to-date Archlinux system.
