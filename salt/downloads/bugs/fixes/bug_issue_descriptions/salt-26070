### Problem Description

I'm using salt-ssh and have a roster file like so:

```
WEB-18_20:
  host: 10.76.18.20
  user: root
  passwd: password
  grains:
    roles:
      - webserver
    location: '2.14'
```

Despite having the custom grain _roles_ listed in the roster file, it's not available to pillar files to use. When I turn on debug logging, it appears that only the built-in grains are being provided.
### Examples

While I can see custom grains if I use a command such as:

```
[root@localhost tmp]# salt-ssh -i '*' grains.get roles
WEB-18_20:
    - webserver
```

This isn't the case if I try to retrieve custom grains in pillars. In pillars, I only have access to the built-in grains provided by Salt. If I try to do either of the following, they fail:
top.sls

```
base:
  'G@roles:webserver':
    - match: grain
    - release
```

release.sls

```
release-rpm:
{% if 'webserver' in salt['grains.get']('roles') %}
  - latest: "salt://rpms/webserver-release-1.0-1.noarch.rpm"
{% endif %}
```
