If you have a repo, say `repo-2.2` and change the state to install `repo-2.4` instead you end up having one `sources.list` file with both 2.2 and 2.4. 

This may not be desirable, so it would be nice to clean it out prior to putting in the repo line. Since it may not be desirable for everyone (e.g. custom additions) it probably should be an option.
