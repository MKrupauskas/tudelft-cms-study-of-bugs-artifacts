In a virtualenv created by `virtualenv.managed` executing a state such as this will fail with recent versions of pip:

```
/opt/diamond:
  virtualenv.managed:
    - user: diamond

bobo-pip:
  pip.installed:
    - name: boto
    - user: diamond
    - bin_env: /opt/diamond
    - require:
      - virtualenv: /opt/diamond
```

Executing the above states will yields errors similar to the following:
```

```

This seems to be related to the fact that `virtualenv` installs the latest version of `pip`, which is currently reported as `10.0.0b2` (that's another bug, pip shouldn't upgrade itself to beta versions - https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5156)

pip >=10 now exits with 1 when called without an argument to install (`Command '['/opt/diamond/bin/pip', 'install']' failed with return code: 1` in the logs above), whereas before this only showed a warning and exited with 0. Now this is fatal.

This has been observed on salt 2017.7.5, both master and minion.
