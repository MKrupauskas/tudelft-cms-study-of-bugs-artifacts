Issue was originally identified in this [thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/salt-users/Nv9eZ0-Ttfg).

The new Windows installer uses a .bat file to call python.exe and salt-call.exe, but the command specified assumes that the .bat file is called from the salt installation directory.

```
Set Python="%cd%\bin\python.exe"
Set Script="%cd%\bin\Scripts\salt-call"
```

`%cd%` expands to the current directory of the user, not to the directory of the .bat file, so this only works if the user calls the .bat file from the salt installation directory. If the user is in another directory, say, `C:\Users\Administrator`, then the command fails with a file not found error.

I would recommend using [cmd parameter expansion](http://ss64.com/nt/syntax-args.html). Something like this ought to work:

```
Set SaltInstallDir=%~dp0
Set Python="%SaltInstallDir%bin\python.exe"
Set Script="%SaltInstallDir%bin\Scripts\salt-call"
```

I can't test that or submit a PR right at the moment, but if no one gets to it first then I can work on it tonight.
