I'm having problems trying to enable services using states. The following is an example of trying to enable the rsync service on a Debian 8 machine (systemd). The service is started if it's stopped, but it is never enabled (even though two states claim that it is). The service execution module does correctly report it as disabled, although in this example I'm querying directly with systemctl.

To re-create:

<pre>rsync_service:
  service.running:
    - name: rsync
    - enable: True

try_harder:
  service.enabled:
    - name: rsync

check_if_enabled:
  cmd.run:
    - name: systemctl is-enabled rsync.service</pre>

`salt salt-test state.apply`

<pre>          ID: rsync_service
    Function: service.running
        Name: rsync
      Result: True
     Comment: Service rsync is already enabled, and is running
