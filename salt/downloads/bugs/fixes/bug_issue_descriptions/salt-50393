### Description of Issue/Question
While testing sending command to multiple minions (200+) at the same time we noticed that some syndic randomly did not send publish the event to the minions and tracked down the issue to the ZeroMQPubServerChannel class.

After adding debug log after

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/transport/zeromq.py#L938

the problem seemed to be fixed thinking that the socket is closed before all events are send.

Worth noticing that we have zmq_filtering enabled on the master and minion side so an event is created for each minion.

We switched from zmq socket to normal sockets ( AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM )  for publishing events and the issue seems to have been resolved.
