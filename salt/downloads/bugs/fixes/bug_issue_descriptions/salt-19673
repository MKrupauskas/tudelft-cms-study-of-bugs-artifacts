In my project , i want create partition unformated using partition.mkpart, but it seems not work.
I got 10GB sdb device in my linux box, it's totally clean,  no partition table  , but when i use cli `salt '*' partition.mkpart /dev/sdb primary start=0 end=100`, it still return message `ERROR: partition.mkpart requires a start and an end`, by the way , master and minion version is newest git develop , 'partprobe,lsblk,parted' also installed.

 use command  `parted -m -s -- /dev/sdb mkpart primary 0 100` in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/parted.py, it can be worked .
