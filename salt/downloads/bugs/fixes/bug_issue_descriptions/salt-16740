Hey - I've written a custom salt module, that works fine and as expected through states on all hosts. 
I have a function within that module which generates output to be used within a jinja template, but when I attempt to call {{ salt['my_module.some_func']() }} jinja returns a dict error. 

Adding {{ salt }} to the bottom of the template to see what functions were available, confirmed that none of my custom module functions were present. 

I am using latest 2014.7 commit a06ed6d151. Have I missed some setup within my module to make it available through this interface?

Cheers for the help!
