I'm experiencing the weird behaviour, that salt-ssh doesn't return from an error.
The command just "hangs" there forever. It also doesn't print any (error) messagse.

Successfully executed commands **do** return back to the shell, printing she shiny greenish summary output as expected.

I'd like to provide 3 examples - called with "salt-ssh -l all" - where 2 show the behaviour:

1) SSH host key ist not verified yet:  **DOES NOT RETURN**
