In the py renderer, the grains variable is defined as "grains" not "**grains**" as is the case with the pydsl renderer, and code internal to salt. Likewise this occurs for other variables like salt, opts, pillar, env and sls

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/renderers/py.py#L29 is the relevant section of code.

For comparison the relevant pydsl renderer code: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/renderers/pydsl.py#L335

This makes it difficult to call salt functions (my particular use-case is to leverage the existing minion matching code in a pillar, where pydsl is not available) as they expect the __ annotated versions.

I was tempted to submit a PR for this but I am not sure if there is any reason behind the differences so thought I'd table it for discussion first.
