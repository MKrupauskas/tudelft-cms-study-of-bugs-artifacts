### Description of Issue/Question
Entries in Add/Remove Programs that have no DisplayVersion are not included in the package list returned by `pkg.list_pkgs`. Attempts to install such software using `pkg.install` result in the install reporting as failed, even though it actually succeeded

### Setup
First noticed with MS SQL Server Express 2017. Any uninstall entry without DisplayVersion will trigger this problem, so creating a fake one would be just as effective as removing (or renaming) DisplayVersion from a valid entry.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run `pkg.list_pkgs` and any entries without a version will not be included. Add DisplayVersion manually and they appear.
