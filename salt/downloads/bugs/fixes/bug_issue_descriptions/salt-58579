**Description**
If beacons.save is called and there are no beacons to save, salt-minion ends up writing the following to its config file - 

cat /etc/salt/minion.d/beacons.conf
beacons:
  beacons: {}

After salt-minion is restarted, it continuously start to print the "Unable to process beacon" message.

**Setup**
CentOS 8.1 docker container
salt bootstrap based git v3001.1 install

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Start centos:8.1.1911 in a container
Install python3 and git
Install salt minion and master as following - 
  sudo sh bootstrap-salt.sh -M git v3001.1
Accept minion's key and call beacons.save
salt-call beacons.save
Now after restart of salt-minion, it starts to print that annoying message. 

The fix would probably be to leave the beacons.conf file empty instead of saving the following in it - 

beacons:
  beacons: {}
