I'm attempting to install Telegraf from here: https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf. I've built a simple state file that looks like this:

```
telgraf-pkg:
  pkg.installed: 
    - sources: 
      - telegraf: https://dl.influxdata.com/telegraf/releases/telegraf-0.13.1.x86_64.rpm
```

Unfortunately, when the state runs, I get an error: `SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert handshake failure` (full stack trace at the bottom)

This is, I think, due to Python 2.6 not having TLS SNI support, as discussed here: https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/749

There's a few things that I think are relevant:
- This is an Amazon AMI image that I launched a couple of hours ago and installed using:

```
yum install -y https://repo.saltstack.com/yum/amazon/salt-amzn-repo-latest-1.ami.noarch.rpm

yum install -y salt-minion
```
- I've been able to add pyopenssl, which provides support as per this [specific comment](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/749#issuecomment-19187417) on the above issue.
- pip2.6 reports pyopenssl is installed:

```
$ pip2.6 list installed

DEPRECATION: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python. A future version of pip will drop support for Python 2.6

six (1.9.0)
tornado (4.2.1)
urllib3 (1.10.2)
wheel (0.29.0)
```

I installed pyopenssl using the following state file:

```
python26-sni-dependencies:
  pkg.installed:
    - pkgs:
      - python26-devel
      - libffi-devel
      - openssl-devel
      - gcc

python26-pip:
  pkg.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: python26-sni-dependencies

pyopenssl:
  pip.installed:
    - require:
      - pkg: python26-pip
```

I now think I've run myself into a bit of a rabbit hole and not quite sure what the right solution is. On one hand, I'm wondering if the fault lies within the installation of Salt on Amazon machines (should it use Python 2.6? Or 2.7?), on the other I'm wondering what steps I can take to install TLS SNI support. Or, it's just this issue: #16409 and nothing to do with requests at all?

The simplest workaround I can think of is to just run: `cmd.run yum install <telegraf>`, but that slightly defeats the purpose of the pkg state.

Any inspiration welcome, and I'd be more than happy to help develop a fix.
