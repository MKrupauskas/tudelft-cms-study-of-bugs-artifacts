### Description of Issue/Question

I am trying to create a new blank Virtual Machine using this shiny new feature introduced in 2016.3.0 via salt-cloud with a target of a single ESXi host 

(NOTE: Not using vCenter, thus no template in use nor specified)

This is related to issue #34880 after a workaround thus the same provider and profile configuration is being used to give this issue instead.

**ERROR:**
[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: local variable 'container_ref' referenced before assignment

I'm guessing this is something that will appear when issue #34880 is fixed by the team but I suppose it could also be something else? 
### Setup
- Single Salt-Master with Salt-Cloud installed, both at version 2016.3.1
- Followed guide: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/vmware.html#creating-a-vm 
- Target is a single ESXI host using a very basic provider configuration
- Profile & Provider configured as per #34880
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
- Create provider & profile as per above
- Update /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/config/**init**.py to include the below:

`if driver == 'linode' and profile_key.get('clonefrom'):
        linode_cloning = True
        non_image_drivers.append('linode')
        non_size_drivers.append('linode')`

**`if driver == 'vmware' and profile_key.get('clonefrom') is None:
        non_image_drivers.append('vmware')`**

`if driver in non_image_drivers:
        required_keys.append('image')`
- Rename `__init__.pyc`
- Restart the Salt-Master service
- Attempt to create a new Virtual Machine on a standalone host, this error is given:

[ERROR   ] There was a profile error: local variable 'container_ref' referenced before assignment
