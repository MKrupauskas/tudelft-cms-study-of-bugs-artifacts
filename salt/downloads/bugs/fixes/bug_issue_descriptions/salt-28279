I'm trying to install shellcheck with `cabal.installed`, but it doesn't appear to work.  This is running on Ubuntu 14 with the most recent version of Salt.

``` yaml
Ensure shellcheck is installed:
  cabal.installed:
    - name: shellcheck
    - install_global: True
```

Results in

```
           ID: Ensure shellcheck is installed
     Function: cabal.installed
         Name: shellcheck
       Result: False
