### Description of Issue/Question

Runas seems to work from single commands from the CLI. Need to test using states. cmd.run with a state isn't passing the password for example.
### Setup

```
test_runas:
  file.managed:
    - name: 'C:\Temp\test.ps1'
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'C:\Temp\test.ps1'
    - shell: 'powershell'
    - runas: user
    - password: password
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Apply the above state to get the following error:

```
         ID: test_runas
   Function: cmd.run
       Name: C:\Temp\test.ps1
     Result: False
    Comment: password is a required argument for runas on Windows
