Running salt 0.16.3 on CentOS 6.4, 64-bit.

I'm unable to use the file.patch salt state on any environment except 'base'. We use the gitfs backend and I'm currently working on a branch. 

My state declaration:

```
/usr/share/zabbix/search.php:
  file.patch:
    - source: salt://zabbix/web/files/zabbix-search.patch
    - hash: md5=dbf20a5964a8449323c95f9d04f23cb6
    - require:
      - pkg: zabbix-web-pkgs
```

I've placed the relevant host into environment "production" via top.sls. When I run a highstate, it fails and I see lines like this in the minion log (note the env "base" line in particular):

```

```

After looking at the file state's code, I modified my state to include "- env: production" (production is the name of my branch). After that, everything worked correctly. But that seems like a hack; the state should auto detect the current environment and act accordingly. As it is, I will have to hand-modify that line if I am ever working on a different branch.

I found issue 5209 which seems similar, but that was resolved months ago and I am still seeing this issue.
