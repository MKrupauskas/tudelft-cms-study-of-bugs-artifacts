### Description of Issue/Question

a `cron.present` state with a multi-line `name` attribute has started failing after an upgrade from Salt `2016.3.3` to `2016.3.6`.

the command is split over multiple lines for legibility. squashing it to a single line gets the state to pass again.

this is very old code, nobody has touched it in 18+ months, there have been no upgrades to the cron app since 2013 and no person has been in there fiddling with things manually.

### Setup
diff:
```
civicrm-cron1: # every fifteen minutes
    cron.present:
        - user: {{ pillar.elife.deploy_user.username }}
        - identifier: civicrm-cron1
 -        - name: |
 -            php {{ install_path }}/sites/all/modules/civicrm/bin/cli.php \
 -                -s crm.elifesciences.org \
 -                -u scheduledjobs \
 -                -p {{ pass }} \
 -                -e Job \
 -                -a execute > /dev/null
 +        - name: php {{ install_path }}/sites/all/modules/civicrm/bin/cli.php -s crm.elifesciences.org -u scheduledjobs -p {{ pass }} -e Job -a execute > /dev/null
        - minute: '*/15'
```
