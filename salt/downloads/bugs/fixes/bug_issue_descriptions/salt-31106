I'm trying to use the scheduler to exec a runner.  Whenever it runs, I get the following exception:

```
2016-02-10 21:10:25,405 [salt.utils.schedule][ERROR   ][21581] Unhandled exception running state.orch
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/utils/schedule.py", line 703, in handle_func
    ret['retcode'] = self.functions.pack['__context__']['retcode']
AttributeError: 'ClientFuncsDict' object has no attribute 'pack'
```

It seems to do this for any runner - I'm using sample based on the docs (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/jobs/schedule.html#runners)

```
$ cat /etc/salt/master.d/schedule.conf
schedule:
  run_my_orch:
    function: state.orch
    seconds: 15
    args:
      - orch.test
$ cat /srv/salt/orch/test.sls
cmd.run:
  salt.function:
    - tgt: 'master-*'
    - arg:
      - /bin/echo asdf
```
