### Description of Issue/Question

Hi

We upgraded from 2015.8 to 2016.3 and most of our file.archive states broke.  They apparently broke because we are using both user, group, and if_missing, and in most/all cases if_missing is pointing to a specific file.

Apparently, there is a non backwards compatible change in 2016.3 (as documented):  "Changed in version 2016.3.0: When used in combination with if_missing, ownership will only be enforced if if_missing is a directory"/

We had been using file.archive to place into existing directory structures additional sub footprints delivered to us as zip, tar, and war files.  And we were relying on the user and group switches so to be able to correctly set the file ownership.  Note that some of these zip files are being placed into pre existing (!) directories.

Is there any way to get back to the 2015.8 functionality of the file.archive function naturally setting the file ownership INDEPENDENT of whether if_missing is pointing to a directory or file?

In addition, even when we set if_missing to a directory, in our limited testing of this scenario the archive is still exploding with root ownership of the files (salt is running as root) - the user and group args are not being honored.  Is 2016.3 really supposed to behave as documented - which as we interpret, is if if_missing points to a directory, the user and group args are honored, while if if_missing points to a non-directory inode, user and group are not honored?  Is there a test that we can run to validate that behavior?
### Setup

Sorry - don't have one handy.  Yes this is lame, but a single file.archive state with a zip files of a small directory would be enough of a replication test.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

For issue one, the question is about breaking backwards compatibility with 2015.8 documented behavior (as well as observed behavior).  

For issue two, we cannot seem to get the user and group arguments to be honored even as documented in 2016.3.
