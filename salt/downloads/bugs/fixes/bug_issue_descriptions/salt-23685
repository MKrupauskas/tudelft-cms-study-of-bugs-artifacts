setup:  (happy to webex anyone through this its simple)
2015.5
inotify beacon set on file mask modify (although many would apply)
reactor runs local.state.sls  to reset file to whatever state you want it

result:
this will loop once any first change is made trigger beacon.
beacon triggers reactor
reactor triggers state
state resets file
file reset triggers beacon
loop

No wonderful suggestions on how to fix this short of a horrible kludge to have the reactor triggered state temporarily remove beacon config, apply state, reactivate beacon config...and whoa boy thats gross
