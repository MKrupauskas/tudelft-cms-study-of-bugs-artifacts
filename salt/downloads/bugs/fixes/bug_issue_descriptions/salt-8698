Given that there is no example for ssh_auth.absent in the documentation, a Salt state writer might write the following state to remove a key by copying a key "name" that was previously specified in a ssh_auth.present state:

```
sshkeys:
  ssh_auth:
    - absent
    - user: root
    - comment: removing user@email from authorized keys
    - names:
      - ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza[...]== user@mail
```

However, Salt will falsely return that the key is not present.  This is because the absent function uses:

```
    # Get just the key
    name = name.split(' ')[0]
```

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/fbfd926fdd0c7686b6be4da1dbfe4e9e18bbea60/salt/states/ssh_auth.py#L272

For the above example, the ssh_auth.absent state will incorrectly check for the key "ssh-rsa" using the ssh.check_key module.

I've verified that the remove key operation works properly if the "ssh-rsa" prefix is omitted in the example above.
