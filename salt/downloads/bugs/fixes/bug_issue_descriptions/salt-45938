### Description of Issue/Question
I have an existing zookeeper server where the znode kafka1 already exists. I am trying to run the salt code in the setup section to verify it exists, and get the error below.

I backported the zookeeper state commit back to 2017.7.3.

I am using kazoo 1.2.1 from the python-kazoo Ubuntu 14.04 package. I tried using pip to upgrade to the latest kazoo, 2.4.0, but it didn't help.

Looking at the salt python code it seems to assume that if the znode exists and it has an ACL, that you have specified the acl to match. I am not sure if that is possible in this case.

I tried modifying my salt code, but couldn't find a way that worked. I am not sure it is the ideal solution, but I created the modified version of the state python code. It prevents the error, but it is basically letting you ignore the ACL.

Talking with gtmanfred he said kazoo assumes you specify a password if you specify a username. The original command we were using before the state was "/usr/lib/zookeeper/bin/zkCli.sh create /kafka1 kafka1". So I don't know where the password would have come from.
