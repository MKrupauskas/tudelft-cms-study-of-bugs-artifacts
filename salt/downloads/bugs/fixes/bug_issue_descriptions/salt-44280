### Description of Issue/Question

While running compound-command (that takes some time), the minion becomes unresponsive.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
salt $(hostname) test.sleep,cmd.run 10,hostname &
sleep 1 ; time salt $(hostname) grains.get fqdn
```

The 1 second sleep in here to ensure the minion actualy started the compound command.

Expected behaviour:

  * The `grains.get` should return about immediately (after the 1s delay)

Observer behaviour:

  * The `grains.get` takes an additional 9s (`sleep 10` from compound command, minus the `sleep 1` delay) before returning
