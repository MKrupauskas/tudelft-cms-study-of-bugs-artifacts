I'm using the manage.bootstrap runner from the Python API and got the following error:

> ssh: Could not resolve hostname : No address associated with hostname

Looking at the code, I found the problem:

``` python
'root@' if root_user else '' + host
```

This always returns "root@" if root_user is True, since the entire term "'' + host" will be interpreted as body of the else statement. Changing the line to

``` python
('root@' if root_user else '') + host
```

solves the problem.
