### Description of Issue/Question
The 'productname' grain is missing on Solaris sparc minions.  The data is instead put in 'product'.

Additionally, in some cases the product grain is not valid.

This is due to the regexes that are being used to scrape the data out of the prtdiag/prtconf/virtinfo output.  The regexes use '\s' to capture whitespace, which includes newlines.  This causes prtconf data to be parsed incorrectly.

For example, on a Solaris 11 zone on a S7 server:
```
#salt-call --local grains.get product
local:
    Memory size: 16384 Megabytes
```
prtconf data is returning:
```
System Configuration:  Oracle Corporation  sun4v
Memory size: 16384 Megabytes
<snip>
```

The regex in the grains core.py file is then matching the "Memory size" line (it is expecting the model to be after the sunv4 as in prtdiag output -- which in a non-global zone does not return data).

```
#prtdiag -v
System Configuration:  Oracle Corporation  sun4v SPARC S7-2
Memory size: 16384 Megabytes
<snip>
```

### Setup
Solaris 11 running 2017.7 

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Install minion and get 'product' grain
