So taking chain of 3 simple commands, where the first one gets an onlyif preventing it to run:

<pre>
T1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo T1
    - onlyif: return 0
T2:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo T2
    - use:
        - cmd: T1
T3:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo T3
    - use:
        - cmd: T2
</pre>


The T3 command inherits attributes of theT2, but not attributes inherited in T2 from T1. And T3 is running, should not run, in my mind. Same behavior with `use_in`.
