**Description**
lgpo.set state module fails to set 'Audit Directory Service Access' - instead incorrectly reports that the policy is already in a desired state.

**Setup**
This has been tested on Windows Server 2016 configured as a domain controller.

The policy can be found at Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Advanced Audit Policy Configuration >> System Audit Policies >> DS Access >> "Audit Directory Service Access".  By default, the policy will be in the state "Not Configured".

Assuming a Not Configured state, the following SLS will provide the appropriate setup.

```
audit_directory_service_access_failure:
  lgpo.set:
    - computer_policy:
        "Audit Directory Service Access": "Failure"
```
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
If the state above is run in `test=True` mode, the need to apply a change is correctly reported.

```
local:
----------
          ID: audit_directory_service_access_failure
    Function: lgpo.set
      Result: None
     Comment: The following policies are set to change:
              Audit Directory Service Access
     Started: 07:35:12.319868
    Duration: 62.685 ms
     Changes:

Summary for local
------------
Succeeded: 1 (unchanged=1)
Failed:    0
------------
```
However, when run without `test=True`, the state is incorrectly reported in the specified state.
```
local:
----------
          ID: audit_directory_service_access_failure
    Function: lgpo.set
      Result: True
     Comment: The following policies are in the correct state:
              Audit Directory Service Access
     Started: 07:35:31.664043
    Duration: 530.9 ms
     Changes:

Summary for local
------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:    0
------------
```

**Expected behavior**
The lgpo module should correctly identify the need to update the policy and do so when not run with the `test=True` option.
