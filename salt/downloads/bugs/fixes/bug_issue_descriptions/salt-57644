**Description**
When using Debian 10 without systemd then debian_service treats it like versions <6 instead as >= 6. Therefore it calls `/etc/init.d/[service]` instead of `service [service]`. With Debian 9 everythings works as expected.

**Setup**
For example run service state in Docker image where sysemd is not booted.

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Run any command from module service in Debian docker image.

Service modules then tries to execute service commands using ` /etc/init.d/[service]`

**Expected behavior**
Service modules command executed using `service [service]

**Additional context**
Bug seems to be in `_service_cmd` where `osmajor` Debian version is comapred with `"6"` this results in string comparsion instead of numeric comparsion so "10" < "6" is true.
