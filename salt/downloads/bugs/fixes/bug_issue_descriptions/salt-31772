### Description of Issue/Question

Using any of the win_dacl states causes state output to appear as YAML instead of highstate. For example, executing `salt <minion> state.apply test.sls test=True` (code for `test.sls` below) results in:

```
              ----------
              <minion>:
                  ----------
                  win_dacl_|-test_dacl_|-c:/temp_|-present:
                      ----------
                      __run_num__:
                          0
                      changes:
                          ----------
                          Added ACEs:
                              Everyone allow FullControl on FOLDER&SUBFOLDERS&FILES
                      comment:
                          - The ACE is set to be added
                      duration:
                          16.0
                      name:
                          c:/temp
                      result:
                          None
                      start_time:
                          10:03:02.835000
```

Whereas the expected output would be:

```
<minion>:                                            
----------

    Function: win_dacl.present                                           
        Name: c:/temp                                                    
      Result: None

              ----------                                                 
              Added ACEs:                                                
                  Everyone allow FullControl on FOLDER&SUBFOLDERS&FILES  
```

This appears to be because win_dacl returns the `comment` as a list, not a string. Wrapping every state function return with this function solves the issue:

```
def _comment_array_to_string(ret):
    if 'comment' in ret:
        ret['comment'] = ' '.join(ret['comment'])
    return ret
```

i.e. change `return ret` to `return _comment_array_to_string(ret)`. (I include this code only as an example of how I fixed and tested - the author will likely have a preferred way to fix the issue).
### Setup

Contents of `test.sls`:

```
test_dacl:
  win_dacl.present:
    - name: c:/temp
    - permission: FullControl
    - acetype: allow
    - propagation: 'FOLDER&SUBFOLDERS&FILES'
    - objectType: directory
    - user: Everyone
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Any use of a `win_dacl` state appears to cause the issue. The example state file above was run in test mode, but non-test mode results in the same behavior.
