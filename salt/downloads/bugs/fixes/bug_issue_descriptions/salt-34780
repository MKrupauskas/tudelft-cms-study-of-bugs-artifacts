### Description of Issue/Question

S3fs appears to be totally broken in 2016.3.1 since commit https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/1d26b124a214907a8eec2b02869f6ac888ee88d6. Previously `response` was set in GET requests at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/1d26b124a214907a8eec2b02869f6ac888ee88d6#diff-8165084beb8c6914b2331d79f2b4d9a2L133 but as you can see, afterwards in GET requests the `response` var is never set (see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/1d26b124a214907a8eec2b02869f6ac888ee88d6#diff-8165084beb8c6914b2331d79f2b4d9a2R148).

This causes a `salt-call state.highstate` to fail, as it thinks there are no files in the S3 bucket. Adding the line `response = result.content` fixed this for me.
### Setup

Masterless config:

```
fileserver_backend:
  - s3fs
s3.buckets:
  - my-s3-bucket
state_output: mixed
file_client: local
```
