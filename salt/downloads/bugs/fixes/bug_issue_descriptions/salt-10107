Let's say I have a state file like this:

```
some-package:
  pkg.installed:
    - sources:
      - some-package: salt://path/to/some-package.deb
```

This will fail if some dependencies of package.deb are not already installed on the target system. As a result, a lot of unnecessary boilerplate is needed to install the dependencies first, and they won't be reported as no longer needed when some-package is removed.

apt.install should call `apt-get install -fy` after installing the package to resolve dependencies.
