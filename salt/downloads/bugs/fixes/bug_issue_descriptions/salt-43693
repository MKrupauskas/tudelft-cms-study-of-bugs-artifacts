### saltstack yum repo for RHEL5 fails randomly
Seems like one of X repo servers does no longer hold the RHEL5 packages, so depending on which backend one hits - i assume - you get a 200 og 404 while accessing http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5/

### Setup
Browser, use curl, lftp, wget or other to http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5/

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Retry accessing http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5/
Retry accessing http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/ and see if "5" repos are present.

Have ruled out local proxy issues by testing from several locations, including one without any proxy.

```bash
$ lftp http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5
cd: received redirection to `http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5/'
cd ok, cwd=/yum/redhat/5
lftp repo.saltstack.com:/yum/redhat/5> dir
drwxr-xr-x  --  ..
drwxr-xr-x  --  i386
drwxr-xr-x  --  i686
drwxr-xr-x  --  x86_64
lftp repo.saltstack.com:/yum/redhat/5> exit

$ lftp http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5
cd: received redirection to `http://repo.saltstack.com/yum/redhat/5/'
cd: Access failed: 404 Not Found (/yum/redhat/5)
```
