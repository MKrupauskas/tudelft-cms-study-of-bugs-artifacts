### Description of Issue/Question

I am using salt-ssh for deploys, and if a jinja template variable is not filled it still returns 0. I found that the problem is the host is returning 0, and salt-ssh is depending on that to be non-zero to throw a non-zero itself locally.
### Setup

map.jinja:
        host: {{ hostname }}
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use a variable that isn't defined in a map.jinja.
### Versions Report
