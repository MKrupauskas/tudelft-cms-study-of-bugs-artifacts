I had an ugly error launching salt-minion (trace at salt/grains/core.py, function _linux_gpu_data). 

The error was produced because i have configured a limited shell (1) for root user and it had not permissions to run lscpi -vmm. The output of the cmd.run command fails to be splitted by ":".

The problem is solved since I've change the default shell of user to /bin/bash (I've created a new user with root/adm group and launch salt-minion with this user and works fine too) but i'll appreciate a better code check at this point. It have taken me hours to get the problem, ouch.

Here is a proposed patch:
