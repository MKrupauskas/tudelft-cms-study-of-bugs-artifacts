These should be grouped first by hostname and then by key type:

```
mp@silver ~ % sudo salt-key -F
Local Keys:
master.pem: <redacted>
minion.pub:  2c:52:e5:66:6b:8d:b0:e0:92:60:3e:98:f4:a5:61:4f
minion.pem: <redacted>
master.pub:  55:2d:d0:1b:05:ae:a8:54:45:41:3f:73:cc:07:be:ca
```

Having the two master keys ungrouped makes the output a little bit confusing.
