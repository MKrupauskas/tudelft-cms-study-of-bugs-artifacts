### Description of Issue/Question

OpenLDAP docs says 

> Ordering is very important here. As soon as a subject match occurs, the mask will be determined and resolution will stop.
> And it is the only place where we need strict entries ordering, which cannot be provided by Salt state module.
### Setup
1. Install bare OpenLDAP
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

1/ Try to configure ACL, eg:

```
ldapi:///:
  ldap.managed:
    - connect_spec:
        bind:
          method: sasl
          mechanism: EXTERNAL
    - entries:
        - replace:
            olcAccess:
              - '{0}to * by group/groupOfUniqueNames/uniqueMember="cn=Admins,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com" manage by * break'
              - '{1}to attrs=userPassword,shadowLastChange by self write by anonymous auth by * none'
              - '{2}to dn.base="" by * read'
              - '{3}to * by * read'
```

2/ Observe your ACLs sorted in a random way when casting list to set. Also, state declares changes on every run, as the order is never preserved.

Summary for ldap.example.com
------------
```

Proper LDIF for this invocations should look like:

```
version: 1

dn: olcDatabase={1}mdb,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcAccess
olcAccess: {0}to * by group/groupOfUniqueNames/uniqueMember="cn=Admins,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com" manage by * break
olcAccess: {1}to attrs=userPassword,shadowLastChange by self write by anonymous auth by * none
olcAccess: {2}to dn.base="" by * read
olcAccess: {3}to * by * read
```
