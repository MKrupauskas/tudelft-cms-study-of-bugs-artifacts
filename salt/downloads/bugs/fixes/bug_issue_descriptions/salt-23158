While client_acl works from master where minions actually connected to, client_acl doesn't work from master of master . 

ie : `salt '*' test.ping` works from master that has direct connections from the minions 

`salt '*' test.ping` from master of master shows timeout from the directed minions only, ie syndics of masters. 

Sound very familiar to the issue i am having while using batch mode 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/22110 thats the ticket i raised about batch mode not working in #20152.
