I'm running a debian master with debian minions, all running 2014.1.10.

Today, one of my windows minions has started crashing. When running via the console with debug on, I get the log below. As requested, I am opening an issue - I have not been able to find any similar issues.

After this has occurred, then I get the following exception whenever I try to run any state functions.

```
The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt/minion.py", line 797, in _thread_return
  File "salt/modules/state.py", line 337, in sls
  File "salt/modules/state.py", line 94, in running
  File "salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 391, in is_running
  File "salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 456, in running
  File "salt/modules/saltutil.py", line 433, in _read_proc_file
KeyError: 'pid'
```
