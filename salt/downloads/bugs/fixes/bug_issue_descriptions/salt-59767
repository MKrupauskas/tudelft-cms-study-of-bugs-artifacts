**Description**
On 3002.5, unable to target Oracle Linux 8 machines by built-in grains if all of the OL8 minion version is at 3002.5.  We are able to target Oracle Linux 7.  NOTE:  we are able to target any custom grains without issue

**Setup**
Default setup

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Targeting with `salt -G "osmajorrelease:8" test.ping` yields zero results.  (NOTE: The saltmaster is OL8 and it cannot test.ping itself when trying to target built-in grain.)  
```
[root@hci-inf-d-slt03 ~]# salt -G "osmajorrelease:8" test.ping
No minions matched the target. No command was sent, no jid was assigned.
ERROR: No return received
```
Targeting with `salt -G "osmajorrelease:7" test.ping` yields results.
```
[root@hci-inf-d-slt03 ~]# salt -G "osmajorrelease:7" test.ping
hci-inf-z-snd246:
    True
hci-inf-z-snd234:
    True
hci-inf-z-snd201:
    True
hci-inf-z-snd235:
    True
hci-inf-z-snd249:
    True
hci-inf-z-snd239:
    True
```

The master has both OL7 and OL8.  You can do a grains.get and get the osmajorrelease for both OL7 and OL8.

```
[root@hci-inf-d-slt03 ~]# salt \* grains.get osmajorrelease
hci-inf-d-slt03:
    8
hci-inf-z-snd239:
    7
hci-inf-z-snd241:
    8
hci-inf-z-snd201:
    7
hci-inf-z-snd246:
    7
hci-inf-z-snd234:
    7
hci-inf-z-snd235:
    7
hci-inf-z-snd233:
    8
hci-inf-z-snd240:
    8
hci-inf-z-snd249:
    7
```


**Expected behavior**
We expect to be able to target just like osmajorrelease:7

```

**Additional context**
We downgraded one of the OL8 minions to 3001.6.  When that happened, we could test.ping them all by built-in grain.

```
[root@hci-inf-d-slt03 ~]# salt -G "osmajorrelease:8" test.version
hci-inf-d-slt03:
    3002.5
hci-inf-z-snd240:
    3002.5
hci-inf-z-snd233:
    3001.6
hci-inf-z-snd241:
    3002.5
```

After upgrading the one minion back to 3002.5, we were unable to target by built-in grain again.  However, we could always target a custom grain we set.
