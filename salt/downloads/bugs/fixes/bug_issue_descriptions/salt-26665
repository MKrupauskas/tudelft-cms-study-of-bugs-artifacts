On a Mac OS X 10.10.5 
`uname -a` is reporting:

and my `salt-call --versions` is reporting:

**But if I do** a `pip install -U RAET`, this adds both `RAET` and `libnacl`, as expected.

log of `pip install -U RAET`:

```

**But after that** the `salt-call --versions` "breaks" and only shows:

```
salt-call --versions

    raise OSError(msg)

```

Until I do a `pip unistall libnacl RAET`, after which `salt-call --versions` works again as expected.

PS: I "think" I had seen the same (or very similar) issue with the `python RAET` and `ibnacl` lib on windows around the early 2015.5 series, but on a `2015.8.0rc3` I no longer see that issue there.
