### Description of Issue/Question
When using a regex with salt.states.file.line match, results seems to indicate at least the caret is ignored and the rest is treated as a text fragment. This results in the content value getting replaced on every line where the supposed text fragment occurs.
### Setup
These are some of the states is in use:
```
# this one breaks:
upstype: 
  file.line:
    - name: /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
    - content: UPSTYPE usb
    - match: ^UPSTYPE
    - mode: replace

# A similar edit with salt.states.file.comment, this one does not break:
nodevice:
  file.comment:
    - name: /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
    - regex: ^DEVICE
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Actual output of state.highstate:
```
          ID: upstype
    Function: file.line
        Name: /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
      Result: True
