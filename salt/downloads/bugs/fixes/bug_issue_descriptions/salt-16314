Minion OS: Windows Server 2008 R2
Master OS: CentOS 6
Master Salt version: 2014.1.10

Normally if you execute a state with cmd.run from the master, the windows minion machine will execute it and return the status from cmd (like "execution is complete") back to the salt master.

```
Name: configurationtool.exe -silentMode -wizard.props C:/tmp/tct.properties > C:/tmp/TCT.log
Function: cmd.run
Result: Changed

Summary
-------------
Succeeded: 1
Failed:     0
-------------
Total:     1
```

Now if the cmd.run takes longer on the windows minion than about 30-60 seconds, the master is still waiting for the status from the minion but nothing happens. The command line prompt on the master will stay on the command line from the executed state. (It will also stay on the same command prompt if I remove -t 600, no automatically timeout. The only way to stop the stuck process is Ctrl-C and salt '*' saltutil.term_job <jobid>)

How the master prompt look like:

```
[root@localhost configure]# salt '*' state.sls -t 600 test
[ ]
```

Although the cmd.run process is already successfully completed on the windows minion, because the executed command created already the entire log and the cmd.exe is not available anymore in the task manager on windows.

If I execute the same cmd command directly on the windows machine the execution takes longer but after the command is finished the command prompt from windows is available. This means the command and application runs smoothly and is not staying in a loop or something.
