**Description**
After upgrade from 3003.3+ds-1 to 3004+ds-1, beacons stopped working, and /var/log/salt/minion filled up with an entry like this every second (matched by the same entry in /var/log/syslog):
```
2021-10-25 21:09:11,439 [salt.minion      :2955][CRITICAL][1036] The beacon errored:

    config = salt.utils.beacons.list_to_dict(config)

```

**Setup**

All minions in question included in their pillars
```
beacons:
  btmp: []
  wtmp: []
```
Minions concerned included 
- [x] on-prem machines, including x86_64 and armv7l
- [x] VMs running on-prem (KVM/QEMU/libvirt)
- [x] VMs running on a cloud service: Digital Ocean droplets
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD

**Expected behavior**
Prior to the upgrade, successful and failed logins to the minions in question would trigger a beacon, which would then be handled by a reactor for notification.

**Additional context**
1. I still haven't pinned this down, but as I was trying to address this, the system did not always respond as I was expecting to various combinations of removing beacons, refreshing pillar, clearing cache, and restarting the minion service. 

2. Has the format for the `wtmp` and `btmp` beacons changed? Although it's what's in the docs, e.g. at https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/beacons/all/salt.beacons.wtmp.html, and it's been my practice in the pillar, I can't add an empty list on the command line:
```
sudo salt 'minion1' beacons.add wtmp "[]"
minion1:
    Passed invalid arguments to beacons.add: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
    
        Add a beacon on the minion
    
        :param name:            Name of the beacon to configure
        :param beacon_data:     Dictionary or list containing configuration for beacon.
        :return:                Boolean and status message on success or failure of add.
    
        CLI Example:
    
        .. code-block:: bash
    
            salt '*' beacons.add ps "[{'processes': {'salt-master': 'stopped', 'apache2': 'stopped'}}]"
```

3. Finally, I have the sense that this changelog element may be implicated:

> Move the commonly used code that converts a list to a dictionary into salt.utils.beacons. Fixing inotify beacon close function to ensure the configuration is converted from the provided list format into a dictionary. (#60241)
