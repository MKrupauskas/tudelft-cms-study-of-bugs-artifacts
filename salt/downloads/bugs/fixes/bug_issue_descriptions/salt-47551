### Description of Issue/Question

Here is very simple salt state:
```
file-example:
  file.managed:
    - name: /var/tmp/test-file.txt
    - source: salt://salt-demo/test-file.txt
```
with test-file.txt having following content:
```
this is a test file
```
I apply this salt state and get correct file on the target. Now I modify test-file.txt:
```
111this is a test file
```
and run preview with test=True. I'm getting this:
```

As you can see salt inverts data in the output. Old data is shown as new and new as old. Now I apply this salt state and I see this:
