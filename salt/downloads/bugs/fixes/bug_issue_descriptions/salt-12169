Salt wants to store a log file if you are running the salt cli on the master as a user who has been granted a client_acl. This check makes sure that ~/.salt is a directory:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/parsers.py#L653

But, salt also running from the cli wants to pick up a per user salt dotfile and check that it is a file here:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/config.py#L638

It can't be both, and I'm not sure what was intended here?  Should we rename the SALT_CLIENT_CONFIG to ~/.saltrc or move it into the ~/.salt directory and call it ~/.salt/config?
