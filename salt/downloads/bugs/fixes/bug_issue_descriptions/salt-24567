Hello all,
I have two cron.env_present states as follows:

```
cron_mail_admin:
  cron.env_present:
    - user: root
    - name: MAILTO
    - value: cron@example.com

cron_char_set:
  cron.env_present:
    - user: root
    - name: CONTENT_TYPE
    - value: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"
```

now, the second one (CONTENT_TYPE) is always reported as changed on highstate:

```
# salt-call state.highstate
[...]
local:
----------
          ID: cron_char_set
    Function: cron.env_present
        Name: CONTENT_TYPE
      Result: True
     Comment: Cron env CONTENT_TYPE updated
     Started: 14:50:00.224036
    Duration: 637.356 ms
     Changes:   
              ----------
              root:
                  CONTENT_TYPE

Summary
------------
Succeeded: 1 (changed=1)
Failed:    0
------------
Total states run:     1
```

This happens on every run. It doesn't seem to be related to the "strange" value of CONTENT_TYPE, and it has been like this on 2014.7.2, too.

The crontab looks like this:

```
# Lines below here are managed by Salt, do not edit
MAILTO=cron@example.com
CONTENT_TYPE=text/plain;charset=utf-8
# SALT_CRON_IDENTIFIER:cron_run_salt
51 7 * * * /root/bin/run-salt '/bin/true'
```

(before and after running highstate).

Regards,
Torsten
