The postgres_user.present state succeeds on its first attempt (when creating the user), but fails on subsequent attempts when the user already exists.

Here is an example of the relevant state declaration:

``` yaml
postgres_user:
  postgres_user.present:
    - password: password
    - require:
      - pkg: postgresql
      - cmd: initdb
      - file: pg_hba.conf
      - service: postgres-service
```

Occurs on minion running CentOS 6.5, haven't tested on any other distributions.

Relevant output from failed runs:

```
[ERROR   ] Command '/usr/bin/psql --no-align --no-readline --dbname postgres -c \'CREATE ROLE "postgres_user" WITH  INHERIT LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD \'"\'"\'xxxx\'"\'"\'\'' failed with return code: 1
[ERROR   ] stderr: ERROR:  role "postgres_user" already exists
[ERROR   ] Failed to create user postgres_user
```
