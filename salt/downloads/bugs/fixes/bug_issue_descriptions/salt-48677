### Description of Issue/Question
When using the npm.bootstrap state with test=true, it always returns a "changes will be made" result.


### Setup

Sample sls:

```
bootstrap my npm app:
  npm.bootstrap:
    - name: /path/to/npm/app
    - user: someuser
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Set up an npm application (outside of the scope of this bug report for now!)
2. Use `npm.bootstrap` state set up its dependencies (or confirm after the fact)
3. Run `npm.bootstrap` state with `test=true`

### Versions Report
I've checked the code - looks like it's in the latest in master too.
