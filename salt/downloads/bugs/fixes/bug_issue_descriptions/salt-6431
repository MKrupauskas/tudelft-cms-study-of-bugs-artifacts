If you have two separate states being applied that both create the same group like so:

``` yaml
webserver_user:
    group.present:
        - name: phase
        - gid: 1004

db_user:
    group.present:
        - name: phase
        - gid: 1004
```

It will fail on the first attempt, but succeed in every successive attempt. I believe this is because the first time, one of the states is creating the group, but the second state has not detected that the group already exists. Then when it runs groupadd phase, it fails because the group exists.

Aside from the fact that it be good practice to abstract this out to a single group state, I still believe this is a bug.
