Couple issues I had to repair in the upstream python code:

1) the 'iptables' cmd itself it not found... on my test system (after adding some debugging to salt code) it seems to be looking for /bin/iptables instead of in /sbin... using salt.utils.which('iptables') instead of just 'iptables' fixes...

2) iptables.insert failing with an error regarding duplicate kwarg for 'table' (and 'chain')...

3) lastly, there's a mis-placed paren related to the standard info/debug statements causing an exception when run as-is on my machine.

I have corrections for all of these, as soon as this is filed I'll push to my fork and issue a pull request... thanks!
