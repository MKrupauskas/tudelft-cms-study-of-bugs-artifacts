**Description**
We have a salt-master process running in a docker Alpine container and the CPU starts off ~0%. There is another Alpine container running napalm-logs and when that starts, and connected to the salt-master, the CPU jumps up to ~50% and remains there. From there the CPU on the salt-master frequently hits 100% and as a result missed events with the below error. This is occurring on `2019.2.2` and `3000.3` and both napalm-logs version `0.7.0` and `0.9.0`.

```
