Using salt 0.17
On my top.sls I have

```
base:
  '*'
    - github
    - openssh
```

The github state include openssh state. That is generating this error message:

```
Data failed to compile:
----------
    Detected conflicting IDs, SLS IDs need to be globally unique.
```

If I remove the includes, the highstate runs normaly.
