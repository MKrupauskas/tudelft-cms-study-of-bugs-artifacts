If we run

``` yaml
www-servers/apache:
  portage_config.flags:
    - accept_keywords: ['~amd64']
```

then change `~amd64` to `amd64` and run again
then in minion

```
cat portage/package.accept_keywords/www-servers/varnish returns
~amd64 amd64
```

but this two flags couldn't be together - `~amd64` means that we want to install the last unstable version, and `amd64` flags means that we want to install stable version.
I afraid, that this issue could be avoid, but I found one way: I changed function `_merge_flags` into module `portage_config`...
