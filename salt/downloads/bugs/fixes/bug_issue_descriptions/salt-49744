### Description of Issue/Question

As reported on IRC, the following state will produce no changes to group membership.

```
shadow:
  group.present:
    - members: []
```

This happens because the group state checks for false-like values and an empty list is false-like, producing a no-op change.

Desired Outcome: Group 'shadow' has no members.

Realized Outcome: Group 'shadow' member list in unchanged.
