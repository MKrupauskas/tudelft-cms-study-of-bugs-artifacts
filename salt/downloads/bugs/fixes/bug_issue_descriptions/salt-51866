### Description of Issue/Question
Fluorine release **doesn't** have a MariaDB fixes in mysql.py module.
So I'm tried to apply mysql module version compassion fix(https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/51530) for MariaDB from 2018.3 branch to 2019.2 one with Salt running with python3 and runs on a problem with the following error:

```
Function: mysql_user.present
Name: root
Result: False
Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1933, in call
                   **cdata['kwargs'])
                   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1939, in wrapper                    
                   return f(*args, **kwargs)
                   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/salt/states/mysql_user.py", line 142, in present
                    **connection_args):
                    File "/opt/behavox/salt/library/extmods/modules/mysql.py", line 1206, in user_exists
                    compare_version = '10.2.0' if 'MariaDB' in server_version else '8.0.11'
                    TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Apply fixes from the to the  2019.2 branch
Start Salt from python 3
Try to execute a `mysql_user.present` state
