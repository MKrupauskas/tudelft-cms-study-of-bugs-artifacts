**Description**
Windows uses a service manager. When the salt-minion contains invalid configuration, the service manager goes into a restart loop as fast as possible, exhausting the CPU of one core.

**Setup**
Invalidate the configuration, e.g. so that a YAMLError is thrown.

**Expected behavior**
The restart loop must not  exhaust a core.
