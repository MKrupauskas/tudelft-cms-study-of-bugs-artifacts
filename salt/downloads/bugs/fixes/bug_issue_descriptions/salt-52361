The acme state and module functions take an optional `certname` argument that's supposed to change the default CN-based name.

However, it's only use is to pass the `--cert-name` parameter to certbot, causing it to create the certificate correctly at the `certname` path.
Everything else then fails, because it looks for files using the `name` instead of `certname`.

As far as I can tell, this feature has never worked since it was added by @mprenditore in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/commit/665803a
