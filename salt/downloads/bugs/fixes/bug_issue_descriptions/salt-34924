### Description of Issue/Question

pv_present with a xfs partition hangs, because `pvcreate /dev/xxxx` will promp up a warning message and need to type Y/N like this, and wait indefintely for prompting an yes answer: 

WARNING: xfs signature detected on /dev/xxxx at offset 0. Wipe it? [y/n]:
### Setup

```
/dev/sda2:
    lvm.pv_present
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

A disk partition with filesystem signature, then use lvm.pv_present to create a physical volume. And here is strace logs:

```
write(2, "WARNING: xfs signature detected "..., 74) = 74
read(0, "\n", 4096)                     = 1
write(2, "WARNING: xfs signature detected "..., 74) = 74
read(0, "\n", 4096)                     = 1
write(2, "WARNING: xfs signature detected "..., 74) = 74
read(0, "\n", 4096)                     = 1
write(2, "WARNING: xfs signature detected "..., 74) = 74
read(0, "\n", 4096)                     = 1
write(2, "WARNING: xfs signature detected "..., 74) = 74
```
