I ran into this issue today:

```
          ID: setup_docker_image
    Function: docker.built
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):

```
 setup_docker_image:
  docker.built:
    - path: /home/vagrant/Dockerfile
```

Looking at the docker-py api docs I see that there is a version variable that can be configured to `auto` and it seems like it would address this issue (https://docker-py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/).

Is this not used on purpose? I don't see it in the state or module. Or is there a specific reason that auto isn't being used for the version to avoid issues?

When I don't use docker-py and instead just run it as a command it works fine.
