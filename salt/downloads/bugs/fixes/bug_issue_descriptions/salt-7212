The `enable()` & `disable()` functions in several service modules accept `**kwargs`, _but ignore them_.
[According to my research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtlcnvZE4HSKdDMzZGRxWEdVMzBkSVFvRWZwOWM4akE&usp=sharing) (and feel free to double-check me), only `freebsdservice` actually uses additional optional arguments to these functions (specifically, it can use `config`), so accepting `**kwargs` [edit: per se] isn't necessary for interface compliance.

[edit: So, could the `**kwargs` be deprecated/removed?]
~~Since they are ignored and aren't needed for API cross-compatibility, do these `**kwargs` parameters need to go through a deprecation process, or can they be removed immediately?~~
