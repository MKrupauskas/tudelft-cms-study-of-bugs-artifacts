Hi,
I am running a salt-master (2014.1.13) with about 20 minions on amazon aws (a couple of them are in another datacenter).
The master is at version 2014.1.13 and the minions are at versions ranging from 0.17.5 (which are running ubuntu 12.04) to 2014.1.13.
The problem is that most of the time more than half of the machines time out during execution of simple command like `salt 'sensu_enabled:True' test.ping`.
I attach a run of said command with `-l debug` but I can not see anything wrong with it.

```
root@saltmaster:~# salt -l debug -I 'sensu_enabled:True' test.ping

[INFO    ] jid 20141103084058939881 minions set([<4 machines here>]) did not return in time
```

Is anybody else having this issue? (also, is there a way to count how many machines have a specific pillar without relying on test.ping?)

Please let me know if I can provide additional details to help diagnose this.
