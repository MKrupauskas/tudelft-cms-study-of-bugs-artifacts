### Description of Issue/Question
When applying a `sysctl` state in `test=True mode`, if the default `sysctl` configuration is not yet present, will result in an error.
### Setup
Assuming a clean CentOS 7 setup, ensure the file `/etc/sysctl.d/99-salt.conf` does not exist.
Example SLS file:
```
#sysctl-example.sls
no_ip_forward:
  sysctl.present:
    - name: net.ipv4.ip_forward
    - value: 0
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
If the default configuration file does not exist, applying the state in test mode will result in an error.
```
$ sudo salt-call --local state.sls sysctl-example test=True
[ERROR   ] Could not open sysctl file
local:
----------
          ID: no_ip_forward
    Function: sysctl.present
        Name: net.ipv4.ip_forward
      Result: None
     Comment: Sysctl option net.ipv4.ip_forward might be changed, we failed to check config file at /etc/sysctl.d/99-salt.conf. The file is either unreadable, or missing.

If the state is applied, the configuration file gets created and the `sysctl` changes are applied.
```
$ sudo salt-call --local state.sls sysctl-example
local:
----------
          ID: no_ip_forward
    Function: sysctl.present
        Name: net.ipv4.ip_forward
      Result: True
     Comment: Updated sysctl value net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

Once the config file exists, an accurate representation of what would or would not change is communicated in test mode.
```
$ sudo salt-call --local state.sls sysctl-example test=True
local:
----------
          ID: no_ip_forward
    Function: sysctl.present
        Name: net.ipv4.ip_forward
      Result: True
     Comment: Sysctl value net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0 is already set
