### Description of Issue/Question

I just tried to upgrade the salt-master package, but the restart of the service during that upgrade fails. That leaves the salt-master package as unconfigured for dpkg and unusable on the system.

Error messages ( from /var/log/salt/master) during the restart are:

2018-10-25 06:28:32,267 [salt.log.setup   :1165][ERROR   ][6901] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
