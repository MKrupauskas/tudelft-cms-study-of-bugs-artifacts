### Description of Issue/Question

If a schedule is defined with more than one "when" value is doesn't run reliably. It may do the 1st or 2nd item and the rest are ignored. Sometimes it doesn't run at all.

### Setup
```
test-schedule:
  schedule.present:
    - function: log.critical
    - job_args:
      - Schedule Running
    - when:
      - Thu 09:18:00
      - Thu 09:18:10
      - Thu 09:18:20
      - Thu 09:18:30
      - Thu 09:18:40
      - Thu 09:18:50
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Try the above schedule with multiple items 10 seconds apart and watch the minion logs, it may or maynot run. We a have the need for a 28 item schedule but it never runs at all.
