**Description**
When using the `file.replace` state, the file's modification date is changed even if there are no content changes.

**Setup**

Create this SLS file and run it once to create the contents.

```
# test.sls

empty_file:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/myfile
    - replace: False

replace_test:
  file.replace:
    - name: /tmp/myfile
    - prepend_if_not_found: True
    - pattern: "^# salt"
    - repl: "# salt"
```
  
**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

Subsequent runs of the state above will always update the modified time of the file.

```
root@d10-salt-01:~# date
Tue Mar  1 13:58:13 UTC 2022

root@d10-salt-01:~# ll /tmp/myfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7 Mar  1 13:57 /tmp/myfile

root@d10-salt-01:~# salt-call state.apply replace --state-output=terse_id

root@d10-salt-01:~# ll /tmp/myfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7 Mar  1 13:58 /tmp/myfile
```

**Expected behavior**
If the contents aren't updated, the mtime stamp shouldn't be updated.
