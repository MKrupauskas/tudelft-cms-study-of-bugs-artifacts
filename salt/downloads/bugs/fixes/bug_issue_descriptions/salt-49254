### Description of Issue/Question

When using the clone option with the salt-cloud proxmox driver other settings in the profile, such as `net0` or `ide2` are ignored.

When using something like a cloud-init template, it's useful to be able to clone from a template but then also to adjust the `ide2` setting of the clone so that a different cloud-init configuration ISO can be mounted.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Use the `clone` and `ide2` options in the same profile and notice that the `ide2` setting is ignored.
