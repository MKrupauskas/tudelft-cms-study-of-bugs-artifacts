### Description of Issue/Question
When mounting a cvmfs fuse mount via `mount.mounted` it works fine the first time, but afterwards it gets umounted every time:

```
cvmfs-dir-cms.cern.ch:
  mount.mounted:
    - name: /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
    - device: cms.cern.ch
    - fstype: cvmfs
    - dump: 0
    - pass_num: 2
    - persist: True
    - opts:
      - noauto
      - x-systemd.automount
```

results in this `/etc/fstab` line
```
cms.cern.ch             /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch      cvmfs   noauto,x-systemd.automount      0 2
```
which is nice and correct, but re-applying this state yields:
```
          ID: cvmfs-dir-cms.cern.ch
    Function: mount.mounted
        Name: /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch
      Result: True
     Comment: Target was successfully mounted. Entry already exists in the fstab.

              ----------
              mount:
                  True
              umount:
                  Forced unmount because devices don't match. Wanted: cms.cern.ch, current: cvmfs2, /cvmfs2
```

so far, I have not been able to mitigate this via the invisible/hidden or other knobs of the mounted state - but possibly did not use them correctly. I almost fear that this edge case may need another exceptional handling in `salt/states/mount.py`.
