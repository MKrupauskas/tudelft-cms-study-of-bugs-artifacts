### Description of Issue/Question

The `edited_conf` function in the lxc state module is not idempotent and makes changes every time it is run. The function is marked as deprecated as of 2015.5.0 and has a huge warning in the docs and the deprecation message about this problem. However, we haven't come up with a reasonable alternative to replace this function yet.

This issue is to track the need to replace this `edited_conf` so it can be properly removed in a  future feature release.
