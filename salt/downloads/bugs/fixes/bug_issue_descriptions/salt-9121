If you switch from a mirrorlist configured pkgrepo:

```
repo-epel:
    pkgrepo:
        - managed
        - name: epel
        ...
        - mirrorlist: https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-source-6&arch=$basearch
```

to

```
repo-epel:
    pkgrepo:
        - managed
        - name: epel
        ...
        - baseurl: http://mirror.cc.columbia.edu/pub/linux/epel/6/$basearch/
```

and run a state.highstate, the proper `baseurl` line is added, but the `mirrorlist` line is left in the configuration, which means yum will still try to use that.
