Assume postgresql is installed and running (no issues there), and groups are there (also works fine)

```
common-postgresql-user-test:
  postgres_user.present:
    - name: test
    - password: test
    - groups:
      - admins
```

Returns:

```

        Name: test
      Result: False

Which is no fun, it works when not formed as a list:

```
common-postgresql-user-test:
  postgres_user.present:
    - name: test
    - password: test
    - groups: admins
```

Returns:

```

Tested with v2015.5.0 to v2015.5.5 and 2015.8 (all from git using salt-bootstrap), Ubuntu 14.04 base.
