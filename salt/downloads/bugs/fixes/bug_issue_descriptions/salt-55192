### Description of Issue
There is an ability in Salt to sent minion wide http proxy: 
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/29322
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/43764

Which supports both setting **proxy_host** and **no_proxy** args.
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#proxy-host
https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/minion.html#no-proxy

Setting this args will affect every module and state which is using a **utils.http** since it uses tornado by default and tornado is aware of those proxy options.

The problem is that if you set both **proxy_host** and **no_proxy** option and use it in the same execution run - it **won't work** with a weird bug.

### Setup
Consider setup minion so it will go via http proxy everywhere **except** the 127.0.0.1 - which is a very normal approach.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Now try to run this state in this order:
```
test_http_source:
  file.managed:
    - name: /tmp/test.txt
    - source: https://sentry.io
    - skip_verify: True

get_agent_info:
  module.run:
    - consul.agent_self:
      - consul_url: http://127.0.0.1:8500
```
**file.managed** will work just fine and download the contents of the url to the file via proxy. But consul agent which will execute a **consul.get** module which itself will execute the very same **utils.http** lib which will execute the very same **tornado** - will fail will the weird error:
```
'consul.agent_info' failed: initialize() got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_body_size'
```

The problem part of the **utils/http.py** is 
```
        if proxy_host and proxy_port:
            if HAS_CURL_HTTPCLIENT is False:
                ret['error'] = ('proxy_host and proxy_port has been set. This requires pycurl and tornado, '
                                'but the libraries does not seem to be installed')
                log.error(ret['error'])
                return ret

            tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient.configure('tornado.curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient')
            client_argspec = salt.utils.args.get_function_argspec(
                    tornado.curl_httpclient.CurlAsyncHTTPClient.initialize)
        else:
            client_argspec = salt.utils.args.get_function_argspec(
                    tornado.simple_httpclient.SimpleAsyncHTTPClient.initialize)
        supports_max_body_size = 'max_body_size' in client_argspec.args
```
As you can see we switch from **SimpleAsyncHTTPClient** to **CurlAsyncHTTPClient** only in case of using a proxy. 

So **file.managed** which goes outside via proxy so is using a **CurlAsyncHTTPClient** and it **supports_max_body_size** is set to **False** in that case.

After that, we go to consul which is uses a connection to **127.0.0.1** which is set in **no_proxy** arg, so we fall into else statement and use **SimpleAsyncHTTPClient** and **supports_max_body_size** is **True**.

Yet we get the `TypeError: initialize() got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_body_size'`
So I kinda assume the following:

1. It's not related to consul, it's related to proxy logic vs non-proxy logic
2. Error is triggered by a specific order. You need to run proxy connection first
3. It feels like the non-proxy connection re-use the proxy socket\connection\object but with wrong arguments this time.
