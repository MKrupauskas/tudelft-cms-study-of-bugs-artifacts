### Description of Issue/Question

When executing two concurrent `state.apply`es targeting the same SSH minion and with a small delay in between, one of the states is not applied and it returns an empty response.

The `queue=true` doesn't seem to make a difference.

However, without the small delay in between the calls both seem to work fine.

### Setup
/srv/salt/echo1.sls
```yaml
echo1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'echo "echo1"'

/tmp/file1:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://file1.txt
```
/srv/salt/echo2.sls
```yaml
echo1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: 'echo "echo2"'

/tmp/file2:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://file2.txt
```
/srv/salt/file1.txt
```
111111111
```

/srv/salt/file2.txt
```
2222222222
```

/etc/salt/roster2
```
test-minssh-sles12sp3.tf.local:
    host: test-minssh-sles12sp3.tf.local
    user: root
    port: 22
    timeout: 180
```

test.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

MINION=test-minssh-sles12sp3.tf.local
KEY=/path/to/sshkey/or/salt/user

cd /srv/salt

sudo -u salt salt-ssh -linfo --roster-file=/etc/salt/roster2 --priv=$KEY $MINION state.apply echo1 queue=true >echo1.log 2>&1 &
sleep 0.5
sudo -u salt salt-ssh -linfo --roster-file=/etc/salt/roster2 --priv=$KEY $MINION state.apply echo2 queue=true >echo2.log 2>&1 &

tail -f --retry /srv/salt/echo1.log /srv/salt/echo2.log
```


### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Make sure `salt-ssh` can call the target minion (ssh key is authorized, etc)

Execute `test.sh`. One of the two calls should return an empty response and the corresponding `/tmp` file is not created on the minion.

Comment the line with `sleep 0.5`. Both calls should succeed.
