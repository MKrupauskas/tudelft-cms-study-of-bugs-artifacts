If I run the following command on a system where none of the directories exist except the first directory (the number of subdirectories is irrelevant)... 

```
salt somehost.somedomain file.mkdir /opt/myspecialapp/data/v9.0/data mode=700 
```

I end up with each of the directories (except the first because it already exists) with 0457 permissions. This isn't right (obviously) and breaks things spectacularly as the owner of the directory is not able to traverse into it! 

Here's are some tests with different mode combinations -

**GOOD**

``` sh
linux:~ # salt-call file.mkdir /opt/blah/blah1/blah2
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
local:
    None
linux:~ # tree -p /opt/blah
/opt/blah
 [drwxr-xr-x]  blah1
     [drwxr-xr-x]  blah2
```

``` sh
linux:~ # salt-call file.mkdir /opt/foo/blah1/blah2 mode=755
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
local:
    None
linux:~ # tree -p /opt/foo
/opt/foo
 [drwxr-xr-x]  blah1
     [drwxr-xr-x]  blah2
```

**BAD**

``` sh
linux:~ # salt-call file.mkdir /opt/meh/blah1/blah2 mode=700
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
local:
    None
linux:~ # tree -p /opt/meh
/opt/meh
 [dr--r-xrwx]  blah1
     [dr--r-xrwx]  blah2
```

``` sh
linux:~ # salt-call file.mkdir /opt/bar/blah1/blah2 mode=750
[INFO    ] Configuration file path: /etc/salt/minion
local:
    None
linux:~ # tree -p /opt/bar
/opt/bar
 [drwxr-xr-x]  blah1
     [drwxr-xr-x]  blah2
```

Notice how mode 755 (also the default mode) works fine, but mode 700 or 750 doesn't.

This problem can be reproduced on Salt 0.15.9 and Salt 0.16.0.
