Hi,

It's the same bug as #22844 , but in master workers.

When calling `_pillar` function, a fileclient is instanciate at https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2014.7/salt/pillar/__init__.py#L116 . This overwrite global `__opts__` in `fileserver.roots` with `file_roots` as `pillar_roots`. This break fetching of state sls.

In fact, it depends on which worker is queried. This make it a bit hard to reproduce. Here is a log:

On minionÂ : 

```
[DEBUG   ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** attempting ** 'salt://lib.sls'
*** CUSTOM *** {'path': 'lib.sls', 'saltenv': 'base', 'cmd': '_serve_file', 'loc': 0}
*** CUSTOM *** {'path': 'lib.sls', 'saltenv': 'base', 'cmd': '_serve_file', 'loc': 69}
[INFO    ] Fetching file from saltenv 'base', ** done ** 'lib.sls'
{{ env }}:

{%- block all %}
  '*':
    - pillar-lib
{%- endblock %}
```

And on master

```
[INFO    ] AES payload received with command _serve_file
*** CUSTOM *** serve_file /usr/local/src/salt-local-bug/pillar/lib.sls 0
{{ env }}:

{%- block all %}
  '*':
    - pillar-lib
{%- endblock %}

EOF
[INFO    ] AES payload received with command _serve_file
*** CUSTOM *** serve_file /usr/local/src/salt-local-bug/salt/lib.sls 69

EOF
```

As you can see, a pillar file is served by _serve_file.

`_serve_file` must always server from `file_roots`.
