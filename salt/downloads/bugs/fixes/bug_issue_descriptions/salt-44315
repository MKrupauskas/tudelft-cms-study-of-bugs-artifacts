### Description of Issue/Question
This was first noticed in windows, while trying to cwd to `c:\Program Files`, however, I have also found it to be the case in Linux.
a cmd.script or cmd.run with a cwd that has a space in it will error out. Such as 
`cmd.script '/srv/test 2/test.sh' cwd='/srv/test 2'` if you remove the cwd with the space the command will run fine. 

```
root@master test 2]# salt-call cmd.script '/srv/test 2/test.sh'
local:
    ----------
    pid:
        27714
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
    stdout:
        test
[root@master test 2]# salt-call cmd.script '/srv/test 2/test.sh' cwd='/srv/test 2'
local:
    ----------
    pid:
        27796
    retcode:
        127
    stderr:
        /bin/bash: /srv/test: No such file or directory
    stdout:
[root@master test 2]# salt-call cmd.script '/srv/test.sh'
local:
    ----------
    pid:
        27940
    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
    stdout:
        test
[root@master test 2]# salt-call cmd.script '/srv/test.sh' cwd='/srv/test 2'
local:
    ----------
    pid:
        28022
    retcode:
        127
    stderr:
        /bin/bash: /srv/test: No such file or directory
    stdout:
```

### Setup
default setup can be done masterless. and without states. although the error does carry over into the cmd.* states as well. 


### Steps to Reproduce Issue
create a test script to run I typically use a file containing `echo 'test'`
put that file in two different directories. one with a space one without. such as `/srv/test` and `/srv/test 2`
run each cmd with and without `cwd='/srv/test 2'`
