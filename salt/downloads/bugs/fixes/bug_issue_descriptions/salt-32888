Restarting the Salt master seems to cause the git_pillar lock file to stay. Right after the restart, log messages about there being a lock file starts popping up all the time and we have to manually clear the lock.

```
2016-04-27 13:17:51,834 [ WARNING] [12961] [salt.utils.gitfs] Update lock file is present for git_pillar remote 'master REDACTED', skipping. If this warning persists, it is possible that the update process was interrupted, but the lock could also have been manually set. Removing /var/cache/salt/master/git_pillar/0fee6ef19f5d8fea99738e1d23b5f4a79616c41661d58ec009e485f062130a38/.git/update.lk or running 'salt-run cache.clear_git_lock git_pillar type=update' will allow updates to continue for this remote.
```

This _could_ be related to #31575, preventing the salt master from properly shutting down and thus preventing git_pillar cleanup.
