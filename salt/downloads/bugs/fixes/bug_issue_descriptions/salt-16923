When you have master_type: failover set in the minion config, and you are running syndics, the check here happens against the master_syndic value read from the master conf and set to master:

https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.7.0rc6/salt/config.py#L944
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v2014.7.0rc6/salt/minion.py#L702-725

It appears this causes the error and failure to start the syndic service:

[ERROR   ] master_type set to 'failover' but 'master' is not of type list but of type <type 'str'>

As we don't support multi masters for syndics currently, master_syndic will never be a list.  This prohibits running a minion in failover mode on the same box as a syndic service (without passing a unique conf at least).  Should there be an extra conditional here to ignore the check when we are a syndic service, or maybe if the master list really came from master_syndic?
