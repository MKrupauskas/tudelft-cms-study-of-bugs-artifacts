As you can see, grains.get can't retrieve the grain's value which is already set up in minion successfully. In our minion configuration file, we define the multiple masters as below. We think the error was because grains master function can't return list, but only return one value.

minion configuration

```
master:
  - test-master.domain.com
  - test-master02.domain.com
```

grains core.py

```
return {'master': __opts__.get('master', '')}
```

Other than this, multi master works good with us so far as an initial test. Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Yi
