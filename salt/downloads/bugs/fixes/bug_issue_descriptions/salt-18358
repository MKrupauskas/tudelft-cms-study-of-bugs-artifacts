**salt '*' test.ping** : is executed on most of hosts, to be precise on 750 from 1150 minions (it's another issue but is not subject of this issue)
**salt -b 20 '*' test.ping** : is matched to be executed only on 20-100 minions

If execute with more precise matching for example:
**salt -b 20 'xen*' test.ping** then all hosts are corrected matched for batch execution.

My salt version is:

```
           Salt: 2014.7.0
         Python: 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jan 22 2014, 09:42:36)

My salt-master configuration is:

```
gitfs_provider: GitPython
max_open_files: 8192
worker_threads: 64
timeout: 30
loop_interval: 180
job_cache: True

gitfs_remotes:
ext_pillar:
log_level_logfile: warning
reactor:
  - 'minion_start':
    - /srv/reactor/sync_grains.sls
```

I think that there wasn't such problem in 2014.1.X release.

My salt-master machine is:

```
 16 cores of Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.60GHz
