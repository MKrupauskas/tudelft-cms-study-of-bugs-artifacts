In version 0.17.2 the salt-minion crashes when there are jid files in /var/cache/salt/minion/proc/
I am not sure whether this always happens, but in the setup I was working the files were probably leftover after our server which hosted our virtual machines running salt-minion experienced a power failure. The problem occurred after we upgraded the salt-minions from 0.17.1 to 0.17.2.

To reproduce

service salt-minion stop
touch /var/cache/salt/minion/proc/12345
salt-minion

The bug occurs on both CentOS 6.5 and Fedora 19
