Older versions of SSH do not support the `GSSAPIAuthentication` option.  This leads to lots of noise on stderr for all targets when it is included by `salt/client/ssh/shell/Shell`.

I do not have a patch for this because I have not yet devised a good way of quickly detecting available SSH options.  If someone has a suggestion then I'll code up a solution.
