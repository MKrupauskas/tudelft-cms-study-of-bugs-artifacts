$ salt-ssh -c . localhost test.ping
localhost:

msgpack or msgpack_pure should not be needed for salt-ssh.

Also, running with -lall:

```

```

I have msgpack installed in virtualenv, so in this case master doesn't error out, but otherwise it still does - but there shouldn't be a need for msgpack or zmq with salt-ssh.
