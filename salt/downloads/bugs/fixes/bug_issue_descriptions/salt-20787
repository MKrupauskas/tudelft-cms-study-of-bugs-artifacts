Hi,

I've just noticed 'smart' pillar merging strategy does not work when your pillar files have more than one renderer (ie. `#!jinja|gpg|yamlex`)

It looks like pillar merging code is actually looking for an exact match of 'yamlex', ignoring cases where a mix of renderes are being used.

Take this as example:

roles/top.sls:

``` yaml
  '*':
     roles.role-a
     roles.role-b
```

roles/role-a.sls:

``` yaml
  #!jinja|gpg|yamlex
  roles: !aggregate role-a
```

roles/role-b.sls:

``` yaml
  #!jinja|gpg|yamlex
  roles: !aggregate role-b
```

With 'smart' strategy the outcome is 'roles: role-b', but forcing strategy to 'aggregate' returns the expected 'roles: [role-a, role-b]'.

Regards
