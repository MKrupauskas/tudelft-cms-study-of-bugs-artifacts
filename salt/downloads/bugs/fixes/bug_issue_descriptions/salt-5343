To reproduce:
1. Add bogus value to `/srv/pillar/top.sls`:
   
   ```
   base:
     '*':
       - foobar
   ```
2. Run `salt '*' state.highstate`.
3. All minions are now broken:
   `Specified SLS foobar in environment base is not available on the salt master`

Fixing the sls on the master and `refresh_pillar` don't help. Minions remain broken until restarted.
