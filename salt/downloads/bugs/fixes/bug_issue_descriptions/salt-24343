Installation of salt-cloud per [the instructions](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/install/index.html) doesn't work. This is easy to reproduce using ec2 image ami-76b2a71e. I expect any ubuntu 14.04LTS install would reproduce the error, but starting from that image I performed the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:saltstack/salt
sudo apt-get -y update
# sudo apt-get -y upgrade
# sudo shutdown -r now
# sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
# sudo shutdown -r now
sudo apt-get -y install salt-cloud
sudo salt-cloud --versions
```

I tried the commented-out commands, but they make no difference. The `--versions` command yields:

```
[CRITICAL] Unable to import msgpack or msgpack_pure python modules
[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:

    salt_cloud()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 311, in salt_cloud
    sys.exit(salt.defaults.exitcodes.EX_UNAVAILABLE)

```

Here's the workaround:

```
sudo apt-get -y install python-msgpack
sudo salt-cloud --versions
```

That yields:

```

```

Clearly the fix is that the salt-cloud package should depend on python-msgpack.

I apologize if this is the wrong place to report ubuntu packaging issues, but I couldn't find a salt issue tracker specific to packaging, much less ubuntu packaging.
