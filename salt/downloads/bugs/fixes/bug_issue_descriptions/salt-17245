Hello,
I have found out that if I try to use locale.present() state on ArchLinux, nothing really happens.
I have looked into localemod.py module and found out that locale is acually generated only for Debian and Ubuntu, however I'm quite sure that code which is used for Debian is suitable for Arch too.
