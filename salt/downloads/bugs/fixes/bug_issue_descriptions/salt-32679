Hi all
I've got the following state with which i'm trying to create a routing table in AWS:

```
pub_rt_exists:
  boto_vpc.route_table_present:
    - name: my_routing_table
    - vpc_name: my_vpc
    - routes:
      - destination_cidr_block: 10.1.0.0/16
        instance_id: ?????
        interface_id: ?????
        gateway_id: my_internet_gateway
    - subnet_names:
      - my_subnet1
      - my_subnet2
      - my_subnet3
    - region: us-east-1
    - keyid: {{ keyid }}
    - key: {{ key }}
    - require:
      - boto_vpc: my_vpc
```

When i try to execute the above state it fails and the exception i see is the below:

```
An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/state.py", line 1626, in call
                  **cdata['kwargs'])
                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1492, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)

                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/boto_vpc.py", line 580, in route_table_present

                File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/salt/states/boto_vpc.py", line 677, in _routes_present
                  if route not in route_table['routes']:
              KeyError: 'routes'
```

As you see above, i've set the **instance_id *\* and  **interface_id** to "?"  (just in this post, not in the actual sls file) because i'm not really sure what their values should be. 
I assume that the instance_id is the ID of an EC2 instance, and the interface_id is the id of a network interface. 
1. If so, is the instace_id and interface_id indeed what i am assuming above ? Are those required for the boto_vpc.route_table_present state, considering that i might not have an EC2 instance running at the time of the routing table creation ?
2. Whether or not i provide the instance_id and the interface_id, the state always fails with the above error.

**Do i have any mistakes in my state, or is there a bug in this module ?**

My salt-master has the below info:
