minions stopped responding to the grain matching with compount setting after restart :  
Simple grain matching works, grains.items works.. but using -C, compound doesnt.  After restart of the minions it works fine then the following error, it stops working with the compound. 

We have grains_cache enabled which seems to be the cause of this issue.  I will disable and see if that fixes the problem.
