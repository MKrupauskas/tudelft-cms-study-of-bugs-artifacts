### Description of Issue/Question

This is the same issue as #33243, but for other functions.

Salt-cloud scp_file() and sftp_file() can't successfully establish a connection to an ipv4-only host, for the same reason as #33243: "inet_pton was being treated as if it would return a falsy response, when in fact it raised an exception instead".
### Setup

Standard salt-cloud + openstack setup, talking to an Openstack platform, using SSH and ssh-keys authentication for bootstraping.

This setup works with Salt 2015.8 stable version.
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run a salt-cloud deployment using SSH as authentication method.
