I have a setup of salt with one master and 25 minions. Some minions arbitrarily fails the test.ping and return message "Minion did not return" and fails in any subsequent remote execution. I changed the timeout in master no use. Restarting the minion helps to get the connection back, but soon it returns to same state. 

I use salt 
salt 0.16.3.
