### Description of Issue/Question

SPM does not work and stack traces on Amazon 2015 in 2016.3.0:

```
[ec2-user@ip-10-13-173-168 ~]$ spm --help
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/spm", line 8, in <module>
    from salt.scripts import salt_spm
ImportError: No module named salt.scripts
```
### Setup

Amazon Linux 2015 with 2016.3.0 minion
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
1. Install salt 2016.3.0
2. `spm --help`

```
[ec2-user@ip-10-13-173-168 ~]$ cat /usr/bin/spm
#!/usr/bin/python
'''
Publish commands to the salt system from the command line on the master.

.. versionadded:: 2015.8.0
'''

from salt.scripts import salt_spm


if __name__ == '__main__':
    salt_spm()
```

```
[ec2-user@ip-10-13-173-168 ~]$ cat /usr/bin/salt-minion
#!/usr/bin/python2.6
'''
This script is used to kick off a salt minion daemon
'''
```

As shown above the python versions are different. The salt-minion script/process does work.
