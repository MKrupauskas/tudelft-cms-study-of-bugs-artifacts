### Description of Issue/Question

When specifying the image in provider configuration file and using a map file to bring up a vm there is a stack trace error
### Setup

```
/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/amazon.conf:
ec2_ubuntu_14_test:
  size: m3.medium
  provider: amazon
  ssh_username: ec2-user
```

```
  cloud.maps.d cat /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/amazon.conf
amazon:
  ssh_interface: public_ips
  id: <id>
  key: <key>
  private_key: <key>
  keyname: ch3ll
  ssh_username: root
  provider: ec2
  securitygroup: default
  image: ami-98aa1cf0
```

```
/etc/salt/cloud.maps.d/map.map:
ec2_ubuntu_14_test:
  - ch3ll-test-2
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Using the configurations above I can create a VM just fine using `salt-cloud -p`

```
  cloud.maps.d sudo salt-cloud -p ec2_ubuntu_14_test ch3ll-test-1 
/home/ch3ll/git/salt/salt/config.py:2274: DeprecationWarning: The term 'provider' is being deprecated in favor of 'driver'. Support for 'provider' will be removed in Salt Nitrogen. Please convert your cloud provider configuration files to use 'driver'.

```

But when I try to use the map file I get an error:

```
  cloud.maps.d sudo salt-cloud -m /etc/salt/cloud.maps.d/map.map
/home/ch3ll/git/salt/salt/config.py:2274: DeprecationWarning: The term 'provider' is being deprecated in favor of 'driver'. Support for 'provider' will be removed in Salt Nitrogen. Please convert your cloud provider configuration files to use 'driver'.
