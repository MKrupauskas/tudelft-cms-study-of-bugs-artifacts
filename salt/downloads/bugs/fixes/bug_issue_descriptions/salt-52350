### Description of Issue/Question
This PR https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48309 deprecated support for python2 unicode string style in yaml. This issue is to track adding this support back into salt for the 2019.2.1 release, gated via a config option. We want to keep the default behavior, but add a config option that can enable the old yaml support.

- [ ] add a new yaml loader that uses the old way of handling python2 unicode string literals and can be turned on with a config optoin
- [ ] add logging to each state that needs to be fixed to use the tojson syntax to help people move onto the new system.
- [ ] update 2019.2.1 release notes with notice about this new config option
