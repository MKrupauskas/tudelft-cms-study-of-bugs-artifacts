### Description of Issue
Trying to prevent Bing from changing search engines in Firefox/Chrome, and keep getting a not found error.

I can see the policy setting on the minion under gpedit.msc so why can't Saltstack?

### Setup
Windows minion: Windows 10 Pro 17763.973

State file that gets the same error:
```
{% if grains['osfullname'] == 'Microsoft Windows 10 Pro' %}
Prevent Bing search engine override:
  lgpo.set:
    - name: "Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine)\\Updates\\Don\'t install extension for Microsoft Search in Bing that makes Bing the default search engine"
    - setting: Enabled
    - policy_class: Machine
{% endif %}
```
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
