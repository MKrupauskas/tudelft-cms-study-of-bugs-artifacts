If you reject a Windows minion's key with salt-key, the minion will consume high % of cpu. It seems to be spinning on key checks. My workstation was using 50% on two cpus. 

Version 17.1.1. 

Very repeatable. Install minion on a windows system. Reject the key on the master. Observe the salt process on the windows minion.
