Error deleting SSH keys when `delete_sshkeys: True` and `ssh_interface: private_ips`

``` python
[ERROR   ] There was an error destroying machines: list index out of range
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/cloud/cli.py", line 166, in run

```

My environment is an OpenStack private cloud, with salt-cloud running outside the cloud. Salt considers both the private address and the floating address to be 'private' addresses:

``` yaml
            id:
                33ded115-98b3-4aa4-aa91-7b46baadcb91
            image:
                None
            private_ips:
                - 10.0.0.15         <--- Private address
                - 192.168.1.85      <--- Floating address (Salt must use this one)
            public_ips:
            size:
                None
```
