Installing some packages fails without any clues in the logs at to why. On the command line, this succeeds:

```
pkg install  -y databases/py-MySQLdb
```

This is FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE-p15.

However `salt-call -l debug state.highstate` fails with a state like this:

```
salt-mysql:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: databases/py-MySQLdb
```

Here's the relevant snippet from the logs. Everything looks like it worked perfectly, except for the ERROR on the last line.

```
[INFO    ] Running state [databases/py-MySQLdb] at time 11:02:07.503711
[INFO    ] Executing state pkg.installed for databases/py-MySQLdb
[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad pkg.normalize_name

[DEBUG   ] Could not LazyLoad pkg.hold
[ERROR   ] Installed Packages:
py27-MySQLdb changed from absent to 1.2.5
```

I get a very similar error if the package is already installed, so it appears to be an issue with the parsing of `pkg info -ao` but I can't see what:

```
# pkg info -ao | grep py-MySQLdb
py27-MySQLdb-1.2.5             databases/py-MySQLdb
```

This is the salt environment on the minion.
