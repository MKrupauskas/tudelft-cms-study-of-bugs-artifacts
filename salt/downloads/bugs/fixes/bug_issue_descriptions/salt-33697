After upgrade to 2016.3 (from 2015.8) my application started crashing on Salt client.  The application is using Tornado 4 as well and client crashes with `IOLoop is already running`

I tracked down the relevant piece of code to SMinion constructor `io_loop.run_sync` and by making change to this io_loop initialization I made it go away:

```
        #io_loop = LOOP_CLASS.current()
        io_loop = zmq.eventloop.ioloop.ZMQIOLoop()
```

I am not familiar with nuances of io_loop constructors or why it has changed between Salt versions but it doesn't seem to break anything.
