When used to do `salt --static --out json`, I received one json object with multiple key-value pairs:

```
{
    "host1" : "value",
    "host2" : "value"
}
```

 I still do, but when that is complete, I still gradually receive single objects like this:

```
{
    "host2" : "value"
}
{
    "host2" : "value"
}
```

Because they come in so slowly after the combined object has already arrived, it looks as though it's running the command twice.
