@UtahDave will hate me for this...

Using the same configuration, running the 0.15.3 package on the website, another new missing global.

Configuration:

```
nutconf:
  file.managed:
    - name: 'c:\program files\nut\etc\nut.conf'
    - source: salt://ups/nut-slave.conf
```

Output:

```
    State: - file
    Name:      c:\program files\nut\etc\nut.conf
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt/state.py", line 1201, in call
  File "salt/states/file.py", line 827, in managed
  File "salt/modules/file.py", line 1519, in manage_file
NameError: global name 'contextlib' is not defined
```

Adding

```
  import contextlib
  import difflib
```

to the top of win_file.py deals with this, but leaves me with

```
    State: - file
    Name:      c:\program files\nut\etc\nut.conf
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\python27\lib\site-packages\salt\state.py", line 1201, in call
    *cdata['args'], **cdata['kwargs'])
  File "c:\python27\lib\site-packages\salt\states\file.py", line 792, in managed
    source, source_hash = __salt__['file.source_list'](KeyError: 'file.source_list'
```

at which point I'm stuck...
