After deploying an EC2 instance and then subsequently destroying it, eventually, I have allocated my current limit of 5 EIP addresses. Rather than reusing one of the available 5 addresses, the deploy of an instance requiring an EIP will eventually fail with the following error message:

```
[INFO    ] Starting new HTTPS connection (1): ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
[DEBUG   ] "GET /?Action=AllocateAddress&Domain=vpc&Version=2014-10-01 HTTP/1.1" 400 None
[DEBUG   ] AWS Response Status Code: 400
[ERROR   ] AWS Response Status Code and Error: [400 400 Client Error: Bad Request] {'Errors': {'Error': {'Message': 'The maximum number of addresses has been reached.', 'Code': 'AddressLimitExceeded'}}, 'RequestID': 'e18da542-482d-4854-bdb7-a6c6a4e70d40'}
```

After releasing the unused EIP addresses, future deployments work until I have tried all 5 available slots.

The network interface is also not destroyed, which may be why this process is not releasing the EIP.

I would expect the destroy instance to release a public address but do not see a way to configure this behavior if it is not the default.
