### Description of Issue/Question
It looks like in the combination of Python 2.7+ and Salt 2018.3.4 the Jinja filter `ipv6` doesn't recognize any IPv6 networks/ranges as valid IPv6 ones. Not even `::/0`.

I think the problem is deeper and affects not only Jinja filters, but overall processing and handling of IPv6 network and interface addresses.

### Setup
(Please provide relevant configs and/or SLS files (Be sure to remove sensitive info).)
This is a simple test case, that exposes the problem:
```
{% if '2001:67c:2e8::/48' | ipv6 -%}
This is an IPv6 range!
{%- else -%}
Not an IPv6 range!
{%- endif -%}
```
### Steps to Reproduce Issue
(Include debug logs if possible and relevant.)
Putting the snippet above into the file `test.sls` and running:
```
# salt-call --output=yaml --output-file=/dev/null cp.get_template /home/user/test.sls /dev/stdout
```
outputs:
```
Not an IPv6 range!
```
On the similar boxes with `2018.3.3` minions the same test gives expected `This is an IPv6 range!`.
