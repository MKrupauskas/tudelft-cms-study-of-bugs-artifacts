**Description**
When LVM issues a warning message in its output, then the Salt Minion becomes confused about the information of that text.

**Setup**
Plain setup with at least one minion and one master.
The minion is a fresh Oracle Linux 8.5 installation with LVM.
Only operations performed before this is the regular setup and accepting the minion-key.

- [ ] on-prem machine
- [X] VM (Virtualbox)
- [ ] VM running on a cloud service, please be explicit and add details
- [ ] container (Kubernetes, Docker, containerd, etc. please specify)
- [ ] or a combination, please be explicit
- [ ] jails if it is FreeBSD

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**
Request grain `lvm` from the minion, using `salt MINIONNAME grains.item lvm`

The output is:
```
MINIONNAME:
    ----------
    lvm:
        ----------

        ol:

            - root
            - swap
        ol00:
            - root
            - swap
```
See that the warning message is treated as part of the output. 

I have seen this output also when using other Linux versions.

**Expected behavior**
A standard set of information with the LVM details.
