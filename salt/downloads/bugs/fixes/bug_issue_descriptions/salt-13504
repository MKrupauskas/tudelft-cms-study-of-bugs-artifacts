Not quite sure if this is the main cause, but I am using custom modules and states with regular salt. This seem to work flawlessly. However if I run the following command:

```
[root@... srv]# salt-ssh m2 state.sls some-state dev
I get:
Process Process-1:

The same call to salt instead of salt-ssh seem to work correctly. 
I'm not quite sure if I should run salt-ssh 'm2' saltutil.sync_all beforehand but even doing so didn't help.
