### Description of Issue/Question

It seems that each state that does something, or perhaps just cmd.run, will output extraneous debug messages `[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output`.

### Setup

Run 1 test.sls:
```
test1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo test1
```

Run 2 test.sls
```
test1:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo test1

test2:
  cmd.run:
    - name: echo test2
```

Duplicating that setup for run 3 would produce a third line, `[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output`, etc...

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

Run 1:
```
salt-call --local -l debug state.sls test
# <...snip...>
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded config.option
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded highstate.output
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output            # <---- note a single line
```

Run 2:

```
salt-call --local -l debug state.sls test
# <...snip...>
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded config.option
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded highstate.output
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output            # <---- 
[DEBUG   ] LazyLoaded nested.output            # <---- note the line duplicates
```
