### Description of Issue/Question
With napalm installed, #48290 causes the `os` grain to be `None`  in Fluorine.  The virtual function is no longer detecting if is is running inside a proxy minion, so it is running and attempting to overwrite the `os` 
grain.

@mirceaulinic FYI, tagging you since you made that change.

### Setup
Install napalm with Salt fluorine release.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Run salt-call grains.get os

### Versions Report
(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`. Please also mention any differences in master/minion versions.)
