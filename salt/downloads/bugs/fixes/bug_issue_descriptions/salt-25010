If you attempt to use an S3 url in file.managed (e.g. source: s3://bucket/etc and in source_hash)  but your IAM role lacks the proper permissions the http get fails ("S3 Response Status Code: 403"). Instead of detecting that failure, salt naively dumps that XML response into the file:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error><Code>AccessDenied</Code><Message>Access Denied</Message><RequestId>4136C880802B5BBC</RequestId><HostId>Hk4driOhdz18SdfP2NGWtaetZQmEui/MoYqrEAA5/TTrlDgxwdYO5tFmGicsVoUs</HostId></Error>  
```

The error you get from the failing file.managed state is quite opaque, because it the hash validation is what actually causes the error (the fetched hash contents contains a similar XML error.)
