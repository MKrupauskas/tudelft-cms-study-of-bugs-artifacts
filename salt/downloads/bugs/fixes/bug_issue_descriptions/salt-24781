Hi, when creating an apache config with apache.configfile, the state seems to succeed even when the configfile has not been created. E.g, in the case that it would be placed in a directory that doesn't exist. This might be a result of a misconfiguration (as in the case below) or on purpose. 

E.g.:

```
/etc/apache2/conf.d/salt-test.conf:
   apache.configfile:
     - config:
       - VirtualHost:
         this: '*:80'
         ServerName:
          - salt-test.com
         ...
```
