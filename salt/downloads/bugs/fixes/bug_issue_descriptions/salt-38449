The `list_tab(user)` function in `salt/modules/cron.py` has some issues parsing some values in the crontab. This causes some interesting bugs:

---

Problem: replaces sequences of spaces in commands with single spaces (see
state example below

Expected: command not modified

```
test spaces:
  cron.present:
    - user: me
    - name: 'echo "must  be  double  spaced"'
    - minute: 11
```

---

Problem: adds a new line every time the below state is run

Expected: detects already present the second time run

```
test env var with spaces:
  cron.env_present:
    - user: me
    - name: TEST_VAR
    - value: '"a string with plenty of spaces"'
```
