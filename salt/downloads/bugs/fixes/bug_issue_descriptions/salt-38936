### Description of Issue/Question
According to the manual tags for a RDS instance should be defined as:
```
    - tags:
      -
        - key1
        - value1
      -
        - key2
        - value2
```

However, I have done that but executing the state fails with an exception:
```
          ID: aws_rds_rds-test2
    Function: boto_rds.present
        Name: rds-test2
      Result: False
     Comment: An exception occurred in this state: Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/state.py", line 1744, in call

                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/loader.py", line 1702, in wrapper
                  return f(*args, **kwargs)

                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/boto_rds.py", line 282, in create
                  taglist = _tag_doc(tags)
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/modules/boto_rds.py", line 897, in _tag_doc
                  for k, v in six.iteritems(tags):
                File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/ext/six.py", line 583, in iteritems
                  return iter(d.iteritems(**kw))
              AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'iteritems'
     Started: 13:35:27.648802
    Duration: 276.842 ms
     Changes:   
```

If I define it as such (output from `state.show_sls`):
```
             ----------
              tags:
                  ----------
                  key1:
                      value1
                  key2:
                      value2
```

It doesn't throw the exception (since it gets a dictionary which `iteritems()` expects) however no tags are being added.

### Setup
Relevant section of the output from `state.show_sls` is:
```
            |_
              ----------
              tags:
                  |_
                    - key1
                    - value1
                  |_
                    - key2
                    - value2
```
