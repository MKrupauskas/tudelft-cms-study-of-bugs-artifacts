Salt is not detecting this as a systemd machine. The start/stop functions work since they're based on the `service` command, however the status (enabled, disabled, running) functions do not.

Output from a salt run:

``` yaml
----------
          ID: redis_isRunning
    Function: service.running
        Name: redis
      Result: False
     Comment: The named service redis is not available
     Started: 15:17:26.346919
    Duration: 6.071 ms

State definition:

``` yaml
redis_isRunning:
  service.running:
    - name  : redis
    - sig   : redis-server
    - enable: true
    - watch :
      - pkg: redis
```

From the minion logs:

```
