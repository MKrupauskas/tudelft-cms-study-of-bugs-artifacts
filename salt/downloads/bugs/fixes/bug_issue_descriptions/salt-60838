**Description**

A custom beacon that uses dictionary-based configuration and works on 2019.2 stopped working on 300x (not sure about the exact version). Likely this is another manifestation of https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59075

The following exception will be visible in the minion log after a restart:

```
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt-3003.3-py3.7.egg\salt\beacons\__init__.py", line 72, in process
    b_config[mod].append({"_beacon_name": mod})
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
```

**Steps to Reproduce the behavior**

I reproduced this problem without a custom beacon using the built-in `status` beacon (according to its source code, it clearly [supports dictionary-based config](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/v3003.3/salt/beacons/status.py#L136-L138)).

Add the following snippet to a minion pillar:

```yaml
beacons:
  status: {}
```

Restart the minion (just in case), and observe the following traceback in the log:

```
2021-09-06 13:24:07,433 [salt.minion      :2947][CRITICAL][536] The beacon errored: 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt-3003.3-py3.7.egg\salt\minion.py", line 2945, in handle_beacons
    beacons = self.process_beacons(self.functions)
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt-3003.3-py3.7.egg\salt\minion.py", line 513, in process_beacons
    b_conf, self.opts["grains"]
  File "c:\salt\bin\lib\site-packages\salt-3003.3-py3.7.egg\salt\beacons\__init__.py", line 72, in process
    b_config[mod].append({"_beacon_name": mod})
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
```

In my case it was a Windows 10 minion, but the same is happening on Linux minions as well.

**Expected behavior**

1. Built-in beacons that support dictionary-based configuration should still work (`status`, maybe `aix_account`, etc.)
2. Existing custom beacons that use dictionary-based configuration should also be supported

Alternatively, a clear deprecation/migration path should be implemented and documented.
