### Description of Issue/Question

I am trying to use the win_psget module to install DSC resources. The module appears to be bootstrapping and installing modules correctly but the minion is not able to return correct results.

The problem appears to come from piping the results of the PSGet cmdlets into the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet. The ConvertTo-Json cmdlet doesn't appear to be compatible with Install-Module and Get-PackageProvider.

### Setup

I have a salt-master on Ubuntu 18.04 and a salt-minion running on Server 2016. All I am using is the salt execution module win_psget.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue

I am using salt commands like:

"salt -G 'os:windows' psget.bootstrap"
"salt -G 'os:windows' psget.avail_modules"
"salt -G 'os:windows' psget.install xExchange"

bootstrap produces an error complaining about "An item with the same key has already been added". This error is not from the Get-PackageProvider cmdlet, it is from the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet

avail_modules ends up with result "VALUE_TRIMMED"

install produces the following:

```
ERROR: No JSON results from powershell. Additional info follows:

    retcode:
        0
    stderr:
    stdout:
```
