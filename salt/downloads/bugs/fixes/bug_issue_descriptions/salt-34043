### Description of Issue/Question

Running any state, either via `state.sls` call or `state.highstate`, stacktraces when psutil isn't installed. This is due to the change in #33942. The bug is present at the HEAD of the 2015.8, 2016.3 branches currently (and will be in develop after the next merge forward).
### Steps to Reproduce Issue

```
root@rallytime:~# salt rallytime state.sls always-changes-and-succeeds
rallytime:
    The minion function caused an exception: Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/minion.py", line 1078, in _thread_return
        return_data = func(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/modules/state.py", line 823, in sls
        conflict = running(concurrent)
      File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/modules/state.py", line 122, in running
        active = __salt__['saltutil.is_running']('state.*')
      File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/loader.py", line 901, in __getitem__
        func = super(LazyLoader, self).__getitem__(item)
      File "/root/SaltStack/salt/salt/utils/lazy.py", line 93, in __getitem__
        raise KeyError(key)
    KeyError: 'saltutil.is_running'
```

OR
