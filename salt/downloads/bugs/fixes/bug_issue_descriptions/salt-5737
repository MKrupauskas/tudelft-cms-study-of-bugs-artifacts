When a new grain is distributed to the minions by using saltutil.sync_grains, it's data is listed when doing a grains.items but the data cannot be used while matching based on the grains using -G option.

For example, writing a grain like the below

```
def something():
     return {'spell':'alohomora'}
```

And running 
`salt '*' saltutil.sync_grains`
will distribute the grain.

And it will even show in the output of 
`sudo salt '*' grains.items`

But matching minions, based on the newly written grain data does **not** work.
`salt -G 'spell:alohomora' test.ping`

Unless, the minion is restarted OR _saltutils.sync_modules_ is run from the master, matches based on this new grain do not seem to work.

Shouldn't there be some command to get the minion to send/store the newly gained grain ? And shouldn't it be triggered automatically when we do _sync_grains_ ?
