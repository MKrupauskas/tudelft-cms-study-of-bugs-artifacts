I had a pillar that generated an error (bug #5608 test, it's called list-all-minions).

here I remove the reference to the pillar:

```
root@salt-master:/home/salt/conf/machine/monitoring/munin-master# vi /home/salt/pillar/top.sls
```

And here I run highstate on that minion:

```
root@salt-master:/home/salt/conf/machine/monitoring/munin-master# salt monitoring state.highstate test=true
monitoring:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering SLS list-all-minions failed, render error:


[snip same traceback as in #5608]
```

pillar data works:

```
root@salt-master:/home/salt/conf/machine/monitoring/munin-master# salt monitoring pillar.data
monitoring:
    ----------
    allhosts:
        ----------
        bulk:
[lots of private pillar data]
```

But state.highstate still does not work:

```
root@salt-master:/home/salt/conf/machine/monitoring/munin-master# salt monitoring state.highstate test=true
monitoring:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Pillar failed to render with the following messages:
----------
    Rendering SLS list-all-minions failed, render error:

[same trackback as in bug #5608]
```

Is this related to test=true looking at another cache? No, without test=true I still get the error.

I thought you had said pillar.data always updates the cache on the minion...
