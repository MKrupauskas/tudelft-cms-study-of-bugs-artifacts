[git.latest docs](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/all/salt.states.git.html#salt.states.git.latest) state that mirror and bare are “incompatible with rev, as nothing will be checked out.” But that situation doesn't raise an error. And apparently it silently fetches just the specified rev, so the mirror only gets partially updated. My `release/xyz` branch was not getting updated, until I removed the `rev` from the `git.latest` state.

The state looked like this:

```
repo-{{ repo }}:
  git.latest:
    - name: git@{{ gituser }}-{{ repo }}-repo.github.com:{{ gituser }}/{{ repo }}.git
    - rev: master
    - target: /var/git/{{ repo }}
    - mirror: True
  require:
    - file: /var/git
    - pkg.installed: git-core
```

and removing the `rev` line got things working.
