### Description of Issue/Question

The `file.line` state function is broken on Windows due to a bug in the `win_file` execution module. When using the `file.line` function, execution fails with `NameError: global name '__opts__' is not defined`.

In my opinion, this is due to the crazy way how the `win_file` module uses functions from the `file` module, while at the same time replacing the `file` module. The `win_file` module selective imports functions from the `file` module, completely bypassing the Salt loader mechanism. This means that the `__opts__` dunder is not inject into the `file` module and thus not available to its functions.

The `win_file` module also imports a lot of internal functions from the `file` module because calling the `file` moduleâ€™s public functions without these imports would result in `NameError`s as well. This has the crazy effect that internal changes made to the `file` module may actually break the `win_file` module if it is not updated accordingly (e.g. by adding imports for newly added internal functions). I learned this the hard way when writing the patch for #39842.

For this reason, I think that effort should be put into cleaning up the `win_file` module and making it work without all these explicit imports of internal functions.

From an architectural point of view, the cleanest way would be making the `file` module purely virtual and having three implementation modules: A `posix_file` module providing `file` on non-Windows platforms, a `win_file` module providing `file` on Windows platforms, and a utility module that implements the functionality shared by the `posix_file` and `win_file` modules.

However, this would be quite a big change and should most likely not be done in a bugfix release. For this reason, it should be investigated whether using the `salt.loader.raw_mod` function for using the `file` module from the `win_file` module might at least fix this issue (and possibly similar undiscovered issues) caused by the current import scheme.

Such a change would only have to touch the `win_file` module and thus code that essentially is already broken. A larger refactoring of the `file` code should still be considered for a future major release.

### Setup
`/srv/salt/test/line_test.sls`:
```
managed_file:
  file.line:
    - name: 'C:\mytest.txt'
    - match: "Second line"
    - content: "Other text"
    - mode: replace
```

`C:\mytest.txt` (on minion):
```
First line
Second line
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Running `salt server.example.com state.apply test.line_test` results in:

```
server.example.com:
----------
          ID: managed_file
    Function: file.line
        Name: C:\mytest.txt
      Result: False
