### Description of Issue/Question
When using `salt-call` (--local or not), Salt reports when a function `key.blah` is not available. Running only `key` to print all available options succeeds with the correct output, but an unhandled exception occurs when exiting.

### Setup
Multiple different setups, masterless minions, large syndicated groups, etc. Same results and traceback on CentOS 7.6, Manjaro, Arch, and Debian 9.5. I did not see anything useful in trace logs.

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
Masterless minion with nothing running and no state files in place.

```
# /etc/salt/minion
id: test
````

```
$ sudo salt-call key.blah
'key.blah' is not available.

$ sudo salt-call key
local:
    ----------
    key:
        'key' is not available.
    key.finger:
    keyboard.set_x:
        ...

[ERROR   ] An un-handled exception was caught by salt's global exception handler:
KeyError: u'retcode'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/bin/salt-call", line 11, in <module>
    salt_call()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/scripts.py", line 431, in salt_call
    client.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/call.py", line 57, in run
    caller.run()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/salt/cli/caller.py", line 158, in run
    elif ret['retcode'] != salt.defaults.exitcodes.EX_OK:
KeyError: u'retcode'
Traceback (most recent call last):

    elif ret['retcode'] != salt.defaults.exitcodes.EX_OK:
KeyError: u'retcode'
```

`salt-run` only returns 'not available' for both with no traceback.

```
$ sudo salt-run key.blah
'key.blah' is not available.

$ sudo salt-run key
'key' is not available.
```
