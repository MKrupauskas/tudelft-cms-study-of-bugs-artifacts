### Description of Issue/Question

Using salt-cloud 2019.2 with openstack driver configured, I can instanciate VMs without problem.

If I use a cloud-map file with 3 vms, two of which are up and running and the third is to be created, `salt-cloud -m my-cloud.map` correctly excludes the two running vms and creates the third one. So it appears in some circumstances running servers could be queried.

But after the server has been instanciated, `salt-cloud -Q` is unable to query openstack on this server and tells servers are absent despite they are up and running.

```
# salt-cloud -Q -m my-cloud.map 
ovh-gra3:
    ----------
    openstack:
        ----------
        server1.company.tld:
            Absent
        server2.company.tld:
            Absent
        server3.company.tld:
            Absent
```

Destroying a server with `salt-cloud -d server3.company.tld` leads to an error despite the server is correctly destroyed at the end.

```
# salt-cloud -d server3.company.tld
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
  ovh-gra3:
    openstack:
      server3.company.tld

Proceed? [N/y] y
... proceeding
[ERROR   ] There was an error destroying machines: 'dict' object has no attribute 'public_ips'
```

### Setup

salt-cloud 2019.2 on debian 9 (installed using deb packages from official repo)

`/etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/ovh-gra3.conf `:
```
ovh-gra3:
  driver: openstack
  region_name: GRA3
  profile: ovh
  auth:
    username: REDACTED
    password: 'REDACTED'
    project_id: REDACTED
    project_name: 'REDATED'

  ssh_interface: private_ips
  ssh_key_name: my_ssh_key
  ssh_key_file: /path/to/keyfile

  minion:
    master: salt-master
	
  security_groups:
    - no-input

  nics:
    - net-id: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx	
    - net-id: yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
```

`/etc/salt/cloud.profiles.d/ovh-gra3.conf`:
```
ovh-gra3_s1-2_deb9base:
  provider: ovh-gra3
  size: s1-2
  image: 'Debian 9'
  ssh_username: 'debian'
  script: bootstrap-salt
  script_args: |
    -j '{"master": "salt-master"}' stable 2019.2
```

`/srv/cloud/my-cloud.map`:
```
ovh-gra3_s1-2_deb9base:
  - server1.company.tld
  - server2.company.tld
  - server3.company.tld
```

### Steps to Reproduce Issue
