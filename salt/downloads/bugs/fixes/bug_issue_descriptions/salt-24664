Hi, 
recently I tried using saltstack on my embedded ARM device, but the process hangs at

``` shell
Executing command 'apt-get -q update' in directory '/root'
```

then I tried using:

```
sudo salt-call --local pkg.upgrade -l all
```

but with the same result:

```

```

but executing this command:

```
sudo apt-get -q update
```

manually works without any problem

here is the version info:
