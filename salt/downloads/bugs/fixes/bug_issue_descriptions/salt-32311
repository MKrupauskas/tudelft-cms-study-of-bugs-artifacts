### Description of Issue/Question

When using the glusterfs module to `add_volume_bricks` i receive a stacktrace complaining about an index not found error. I am about to file a PR for this issue.

Reference to code:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/modules/glusterfs.py#L496

After changing the code to this, the module works as expected:
`volume_bricks = [x['path'] for x in info(name)[name]['bricks'].values()]`
