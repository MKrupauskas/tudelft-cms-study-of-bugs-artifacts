I _assume_ that this regression was introduced with 2015.5.0. I noticed this when upgrading from 2014.7.5 to 2015.5.2

With 2014.7.5 this is working without any problems. (so I had to downgrade to make it work again)

This is a system with a hardened grsecurity kernel that hides any processes inside chroot environments that are not running inside the chroot...
