From a state that is run on all minions I sometimes (yes, sometimes!) get errors like this with highstate:

```
----------
    State: - file
    Name:      /etc/apt/percona.key
    Function:  managed
        Result:    False
        Comment:   Source file salt://all-percona-repository/percona.key not found
        Changes:

```

M/M are all on 0.17.2, but I think I've seen this on 0.17.1 as well. There is nothing special with that file, it is mode 644 on the master, and it is not the only file that errors.
