Master: RHEL 6 running salt-master 2014.7.0
Slave: Windows 7 running salt-minion 2014.1.7 upgrading using Salt-Minion-2014.7.0-AMD64-Setup.exe retrieved on 11/19/2014

When we try to perform a silent install of the 2014.7.0 Salt-Minion on Windows systems inside our corporate firewall the installation never completes; running the installation manually results in a "Salt Minion v 2014.7.0 Setup" pop-up error "VC redist package download failed: resolving hostname".

Pre-installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 x64 SP1 redistributable (as suggested here http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/windows.html ) does not eliminate this pop-up error (screenshot attached).

With about 150 Windows systems to upgrade this represents a pretty significant barrier for our move to 2014.7 - I was hoping that someone had a workaround or proposed solution for being able to perform a successful silent install.

We have confirmed that this same error occurs on a system with no salt-minion at all, so this is not specific to upgrades.
